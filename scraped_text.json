        "text": "\n\n(Rewrites story with details on record remittances)\n\nNov 22 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Nicaragua's economy to expand by 4% in 2023 due in large part to record remittances from migrants who have fled the Central American country, the lender said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe IMF also said economic growth would likely continue next year and in the mid-term but at a lower rate than the historical average.\n\nFollowing a mission to the country, the international lender concluded that average inflation would likely fall to 8.9% this year, from 10.5% in 2022, and that the government will maintain a \"small\" budget surplus.\n\n\"Nicaragua's economy has remained resilient in the face of multiple shocks, supported by appropriate economic policies, substantial buffers, and multilateral support,\" according to the statement.\n\nCash transfers, or remittances, from Nicaraguan migrants living abroad are expected to contribute around 28% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023, the IMF added, or double their contribution to the economy just two years ago.\n\nThe influx has been fueled by a \"rapid increase\" in Nicaraguan migration, the IMF statement added.\n\n\"The record-high remittances, coupled with sustained exports, are supporting a turnaround in the current account balance,\" according to the statement, which estimated the anticipated surplus at about 4% of GDP this year.\n\nNicaraguan migration has spiked since mass street protests erupted in Nicaragua five years ago and were met by a harsh response from the government that claimed more than 300 lives, according to rights groups.\n\nSome 900,000 migrants have left the country since then, according to human rights groups, with most seeking better prospects in the United States.\n\nNicaragua's total population stands at about 6 million.

        "text": "\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 The air traffic controller on duty when FedEx and Southwest planes nearly collided earlier this year in Texas told investigators that he expected the airliner to take off more quickly \u2014 before the incoming FedEx plane reached the same runway.\n\nThat is because in his four years working the tower at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, the controller said, Southwest planes usually took off as soon as they got permission.\n\n\u201cBut hindsight being 20/20,\u201d controller Damian Campbell told investigators, he \u201cdefinitely could have held them,\u201d referring to making the Southwest crew wait.\n\nCampbell said in a transcript released Wednesday that he couldn't even see the Southwest plane through the dense early morning fog on Feb. 4. The FedEx pilots spotted it at the last second and aborted their landing.\n\nThe planes missed each other by about 100 feet (30 meters).\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board released transcripts of interviews and other details of its investigation but did not state a probable cause for the harrowing close call. That determination is expected early next year.\n\nThe near-disaster in Austin is the scariest among more than a half-dozen close calls that the NTSB has investigated this year.\n\nThe surge in such incidents prompted the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 which hires air traffic controllers and manages the nation's airspace \u2014 to convene a \u201csafety summit\u201d of aviation industry officials this spring.\n\nA panel of independent experts concluded this month that the FAA needs better staffing, equipment and technology to cope with a surge in serious close calls. The panel said aviation's margin of safety is shrinking.\n\nThe captain of the FedEx plane flying into Austin said he was \u201cirritated\u201d and \u201cperplexed\u201d when the controller cleared Southwest to take off from runway 18-left, the one he was approaching.\n\n\u201cMy initial response was an expletive, like \u2018What\u2019s he doing?'\u201d Hugo Carvajal III told investigators. Still, he assumed that the Southwest plane \u201cwas going to be well down the runway\u201d by the time he touched down.\n\nCarvajal's first officer, Robert Bradeen Jr., estimated they were 100 to 150 feet (30 to 45 meters) above the runway when he saw the Southwest jet \u2014 first a light, then a silhouette of a wing.\n\n\u201cI think I said, 'Go around, go around, go around\u201d to the captain, Bradeen said, meaning pull up and fly away. He used the radio to tell the Southwest crew to abort their takeoff, but they did not.\n\nAsked what saved the day \u2014 special training or something else, Bradeen said, \u201cI think it was more experience and just the combination of luck that I happened to look out (the cockpit window) at the right time.\u201d\n\nAt a recent congressional hearing, the president of the union representing air traffic controllers complained about understaffing and frequent overtime leading to fatigue.\n\nCampbell, a Navy veteran who had been a controller for 13 years at the time of the Austin incident, said he was on a mandatory six-day work week.\n\nAustin-Bergstrom doesn't have the latest technology, called ASDE-X, for tracking planes and vehicles on the ground \u2014 which could have helped prevent the February close call.\n\n\u201cWe had this dense ground fog ... you couldn't see anything,\u201d Campbell told investigators. He couldn't see the Southwest jet from the tower.\n\n\u201cIt became a concern when I didn't hear Southwest's engines\u201d revving for takeoff on a flight to Cancun, Mexico, he said. \u201cAnd at that point, it became a critical issue.\u201d",

That compares to a previous medium-term forecast, which called for annual increases between the mid-20s and low-30s. The Dutch payments company\u2019s US-listed ADRs jumped as much as 37%.\n\nWhile Adyen said its \u201csubstantial long-term opportunity remains unchanged,\u201d it wanted to specify its expectations for the coming three years.\n\nRevising forecast with a third-quarter update is a departure from its customary half-yearly reports and reflects pressure to provide greater clarity on its growth trajectory. It comes after Adyen had shocked the market in August by disclosing its slowest net revenue increase since listing in 2018. Its shares plunged 39% that day, and the shaken confidence has erased \u20ac24.1 billion ($25.8 billion) of its market value since then.\n\nInvestors had demanded more frequent financial communication and a clear blueprint for achieving its growth ambitions, and many questioned whether the medium-term targets need to be reset.\n\nRead More: PayPal Rival Fintech Adyen Faces Investor Confidence Test\n\nIn its business update on Wednesday, Adyen also said it aims to improve earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to above 50% of sales in 2026.

Its 3Q update signaled a scaling back of hiring in 2024, with cost control now more critical as revenue momentum slows.\u201d\n\n\u2014Tomasz Noetzel, BI Banking Analyst\n\nAdyen New Ebitda Margin Realigned to Reality: React\n\n\u201cWith regards to the updated midterm ambition we remain cautious given the wide range of outcomes,\u201d Jefferies International analyst Hannes Leitner said in a note to clients. He said that while the overall targets are \u201clikely more realistic, they still look ambitious.\u201d\n\nIt also outlined plans to update the market more often. Listening to investor feedback, \u201cwe understand that more updates about how the business is developing along the way would helpful,\u201d Adyen Chief Financial Officer Ethan Tandowsky said at the company\u2019s investor day in San Francisco. \u201cWe plan to share quarterly updates in the year ahead at least,\u201d he said.\n\nAdyen, which competes with the likes of Stripe Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc.-owned Braintree, had attributed the sales slowdown in the first half of the year to increasing price competition in North America, its second-largest market. It had said customers there had tightened purse strings and shifted some volumes to cheaper rivals.\n\nNet revenue in the third quarter rose 22% to \u20ac413.6 million and processed volume increased at a similar pace to \u20ac243.1 billion, the Amsterdam-based company said. The firm added 175 employees in the third quarter, saying it is in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of its industry-defying hiring push.\n\n(Updates to add analyst and CFO comments from seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\n\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\n\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\n\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\n\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\n\nSARAJEVO (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal said on Friday it had temporarily halted output at its Bosnia steel plant and at mines that supply it with iron ore due to a drop in demand in the European steel market.\n\nThe company, which produces about 700,000 tonnes of liquid steel annually and employs about 2,200 workers, said the European steel market has cut demand due to a lower steel consumption that begun in 2022 with the war in Ukraine, the spike in energy prices and output costs, as well as inflation.\n\nThe ArcelorMittal plant in the central town of Zenica said that it halted the operation of its High Oven last Saturday and then gradually stopped the output in other drives, after carefully considering all options available.\n\n\"ArcelorMittal Zenica plans to continue with normal operation as soon as demand returns to the level that enables sustainable business,\" it said in a statement to Reuters.\n\n\"Conditions of demand have significantly worsened in the second half of 2023, and there are expectations that this negative cycle will continue led by a continued economic uncertainty resulting from high inflation,\" the statement said.\n\nIt also said that sales quotas have been limited due to the protective regime imposed by the European Union, and that steel makers had to compete with cheaper steel products imported from Turkey.\n\nAt the same time, the concentration of the metal in the iron ore obtained from the Omarska mines that supply the plant has fallen to 47% from 53%, which means that bigger ore quantities must be purchased for the production of the same quantity of the metal, the company said.\n\nIt said that it has also halted the deliveries from the iron ore mines for as long as its output has been suspended. The Omarska mines further to the north, employing about 850 workers, fully depends on the sales of ore to the Zenica plant.\n\nLast month, the worker unions announced a general strike requesting a new bargaining deal but they are pondering to postpone it after the company has halted production.\n\nArcelorMittal said it had increased wages 32% since 2020 because of the inflation.\n\n(Reporting by Daria Sito-Sucic; Editing by David Evans)",

The stock rose about 8.1% on Thursday.\n\n\"At this point of time, I think we've got a lot on our plate and they (First Quantum) are dealing with a difficult situation, so we will focus on our strategy,\" CEO Mark Bristow told Reuters when asked whether Barrick has interest in acquiring First Quantum.\n\nBristow added that the company is growing its copper on its own, repeating a similar stance he took in an August interview with Reuters when he dismissed a June media report that Barrick was in talks with First Quantum on a possible acquisition.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Barrick beat analysts estimates for its quarterly helped by lower cost and high gold prices.\n\nBarrick has been investing in copper as the red metal is poised to play a key role in the transition to a greener economy. But instead of striking deals like its peers, such as BHP Group and Rio Tinto, that have bought copper mines in the past two years, Barrick has focused on investing in its own mines.\n\n\"This is a reinforcement of what I stand for in Barrick... For me, M&A is an ad hoc opportunity to create value. It shouldn't be the core to anyone's strategy,\" he added.\n\nWhen asked if Barrick has offered advise to First Quantum on the Panama situation, Bristow said, \"It's a tough time for any company and I don't want to put my finger in this soup.\"\n\n(Reporting by Divya Rajagopal, Editing by Franklin Paul and Marguerita Choy)",

        "text": "\nBy Bianca Flowers and Lisa Baertlein\n(Reuters) - The tentative agreements reached between the United Auto Workers and the Detroit Three automakers mark another major victory for labor unions that have turned up the pressure on big corporations to put better deals on the table.\nUnions have taken an aggressive approach to campaigning with a series of high-profile battles across the industrial, auto, entertainment and healthcare industries. Experts say gains won by unions could spur more organizing and motivate non-unionized companies to try to stave off those efforts.\nThe UAW's talks, replete with weekly addresses by union President Shawn Fain, were among the most unabashed. The union came to tentative agreements with Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis in recent days, followed by General Motors early Monday.\n\"This is a set of negotiations, historically, where gains made in Detroit would be viewed and adapted by many other industries across the economy,\" said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California, Berkley.\nUnion worker compensation has finally caught up to non-union wage increases dating from the COVID-19 pandemic, according to U.S. federal data, as the labor market has remained tight with unemployment at just 3.8%.\nThe tentative deals are expected to amount to total pay hikes of more than 33% when compounding and cost-of-living increases are factored in. The agreements may be a selling point for non-union shops to push for unionization, said San Francisco State University labor and employment professor John Logan.\n\"The Big Three would want the UAW to organize Tesla,\" he added.\nNissan and other competitors may feel compelled to boost wages to retain their workforce. The union made its intention to expand autoworker unionization clear in a series of posts on social media late Sunday that highlighted the length of the contract, which ends in 2028.\n\"One of our biggest goals coming out of this historic contract victory is to organize like we\u2019ve never organized before,\" the UAW wrote. \"When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won\u2019t just be with the Big Three, but with the Big Five or Big Six.\"\nPublic support for unions has helped engagement in traditionally unionized industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. A Reuters poll showed the majority of Americans stand behind striking workers.\nEmployee-led unionization efforts at retailers, such as Amazon and Starbucks, have reflected a consensus among workers who see unions as a means to secure better wages and working conditions.\nOrganization has been difficult in recent years. About 11.3% of workers were represented by unions last year compared with 23.6% in 1982, according to data analyzed by the Economic Policy Institute.\nRIPPLE EFFECT\nThe UAW contracts are among many deals reached this year, along with agreements at UPS and construction equipment maker Caterpillar. Workers at other companies, like Mack Truck and equipment makers CNH Industrial and Deere & Co have all rebuffed initial deals despite raises that in some contracts appeared significant.\nIncreased awareness among workers about record profits has translated to company concessions and improved deals, said Marcos Feldman, senior researcher at Jobs to Move America, a labor organizing nonprofit.\n\"The task is to solidify and institutionalize it,\" Feldman said. \"Unionizing efforts are the most aggressive they've ever been.\"\nPresident Joe Biden considers unions a cornerstone of his economic policies, including the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law to boost American manufacturing.\nEmployers may respond by boosting worker pay to hold off union efforts, or step up efforts to prevent unionization.\nSome Starbucks employees have claimed the coffee chain illegally retaliated against organizers by firing employees and closing stores. Earlier this month the U.S. Department of Labor ordered the company to disclose documents pertaining to anti-union spending.\nAmazon has dissuaded unionization, with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) recently ruling the e-commerce giant had threatened to withhold wages and benefits from employees at two New York warehouses.\nUPS AND ITS RIVALS\nThe UPS deal in August raised pay and eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers at the Atlanta-based company. That bolstered organizing efforts among Amazon workers and put pressure on UPS rivals to close a growing gap in pay.\nWhen the new UPS agreement expires in 2028, the average full-time U.S. driver will make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits, significantly more than peers employed by contractors for Amazon and FedEx.\nAmazon in September gave delivery contractors $440 million for the year to raise average driver pay to an estimated $20.50 per hour. Amazon told Reuters that payment was part of normal increases and not influenced by the UPS contract. It did not provide prior-year comparisons. FedEx said it regularly reviews pay for directly employed delivery workers to ensure that it is competitive and that its delivery contractors set their own wage rates.\n\"One thing we've seen in this economy is that workers are more likely to quit when they are unhappy,\" said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. \"Industries where they're more likely to stay are the ones where they unionize and they stay and fight.\"\n(Reporting by Bianca Flowers; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Alistair Bell)",

Lawmakers have criticized the government for quickly rolling out support without regard for the cost to taxpayers.\nMost of the problems are with loans issued to small firms under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme. Across the program, banks have flagged 3.75% of loans by value as suspected fraud, according to the government.\nBarclays Plc, the largest lender in the program, said over 6% of its loans were now considered possible fraud, up from 2.3% earlier in the year. Starling Bank, which lent \u00a31.6 billion under BBLS, has also flagged 6%, or about \u00a397 million, of its drawn loans as potential fraud.\n\u201cWe continue to proactively tackle BBLS fraud, going above and beyond the requirements of the government lending schemes,\u201d a Barclays spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis has included a pilot to investigate the use of, and proactively recover BBLS funds through our work with liquidators and a litigation funder.\u201d\nThe lender last year asked UK courts to shutter nearly 100 businesses as it sought to recover Covid-19 debts.\n\u201cStarling takes a strong and proactive stance on BBLS to protect taxpayers\u2019 money, as well as to support our customers to help them repay their loans,\u201d the bank said in a statement. \u201cOur lending saved thousands of companies. It largely supported eligible micro businesses with single directors, many of which were relatively young businesses.\u201d\nThe Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, aimed at larger companies, is showing much lower levels of suspected fraud.

        "text": "\nIn this article, we will be taking a look at the 30 most fertile countries in the world heading into 2024. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most fertile countries in the world heading into 2024.\nThe fertility rate is one of the most important indicators for countries and global bodies to assess future requirements and resource allocation, and in this respect, both really high and really low fertility rates can have devastating consequences. While we'll discuss the negative impact of high fertility rates as we further talk about the most fertile countries in the world heading into 2024, we'll first consider the impact of low birth rates in countries such as Japan and South Korea.\nA cultural shift has led to younger people in Japan balking at the thought of marriage or starting a family, especially due to concerns regarding job opportunities and the income needed to sufficiently support a family. At the same time, Japan's high life expectancy (it has the second highest life expectancy in the world in 2023) has led to it being home to a more aging population which has brought a myriad of problems to the country. The healthcare system in the country has struggled immensely to provide the necessary care needed for an increasingly aging population while economic growth has also suffered. The decline in labor force has of course, negatively impacted the economy and will continue to do so unless a major shift takes place. While Japan is encouraging its residents to have kids and is providing support to people starting a family, if the policy is not successful, there may be more repercussions in the future. This is why there are several companies operating in the fertility space and offering scientific solutions to improve the chances of a successful birth. Even in the United State, there are several such companies aiming to provide couples with solutions on having a child even if they are unable to conceive naturally.\nLolostock/Shutterstock.com\nOne such company operating in the fertility space is Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) which offers over 900 fertility specialists which provide information on different topics relating to fertility. Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) has seen its share price rise by nearly 10% YTD 2023 and has demonstrated exceptional growth in recent results, as mentioned in the company's Q2 2023 earnings call, where it stated \"We're pleased to report that Progyny had a very solid second quarter, highlighted by record quarterly revenue of $279 million or 43% growth over the second quarter of 2022. The strength in this quarter's result reflect that member activity continues to be healthy, further affirming not only the essential nature of fertility care but also the strong desire amongst members to pursue the appropriate medical treatments they need in order to realize their family-building goals..... Last month, the CDC released its annual outcomes data on the fertility industry in the US, reflecting treatments completed through the end of '21. For the seventh straight year, Progyny has significantly outperformed the national averages across every relevant benchmark for success. As a reminder, Progyny is the only solution that is doing comprehensive outcomes reporting, reflecting virtually every treatment for every member across all relevant metrics. You will see these results reported in our second quarter 10-Q. Since launching our solution in 2016, we've consistently achieved higher pregnancy rates, higher live birth rates, lower rates of miscarriages and significantly fewer multiple births. Our superior clinical results not only create a better member experience as they ensure members avoid unnecessary treatments and painful complications, they also drive cost containment for our clients given that Progyny members on average require fewer treatments in order to get to the desired outcome of a healthy baby.\"\nProgyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) was also highlighted by Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy, which made the following comment about Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\u201cThe top contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s relative performance in the second quarter included AppFolio, Goosehead Insurance, and Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY). Finally, Progyny, a provider of fertility benefits to self-insured companies, continues to deliver powerful results headlined by 50% YoY revenue growth and 87% YoY adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) growth. Concerns about the impact of significant tech layoffs on their business have been put to rest, as the secular tailwind around the demand for high-quality fertility and family-building care remains very much intact. The combination of these powerful secular tailwinds and the company\u2019s industry diversification efforts over the last few years has translated into sustained and resilient growth in the face of macro uncertainty.\u201d\nAt the other end of the spectrum are the most fertile countries in the world heading into 2024, most of which are located in Africa, a region already suffering from poverty and a low standard of living. Extremely high birth rates simply add more pressure on the economy as the resources needed to improve the standard of living far outweigh the economy of such nations. This is one of the reasons why countries with higher fertility rates also face greater instances of starvation and malnutrition.\nTo combat this, many companies and governmental bodies are starting programs and encouraging family planning. Unfortunately, birth control and family planning are strongly linked to religious and traditional values, which makes it harder to be effective especially in the most fertile countries in the world which generally have strong religious and traditional connotations. Many countries have banned outright medical processes such as abortion hence, have removed a safe way to avoid having children if the family doesn't want to.\nHowever, to provide for the ever-increasing contraceptive market, said to be worth around $28 billion and expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% till 2030, many companies are aiming to carve out their presence in this industry. One of the most well-known contraceptive brands is Durex, manufactured by Reckitt Benckiser group and part of their Wellness Care portfolio. Durex is the top-selling condom brand in the world and extremely important to the overall performance of Reckitt Benckiser, who mentioned its performance in the company's Q2 2023 earnings report, stating \"Our Health business has had a strong first half, delivering 8.8% like-for-like net revenue growth and high 20s adjusted operating margins. Our OTC and intimate wellness portfolios in particular have performed very well..... Our Health business has had a strong first half, delivering 8.8% like-for-like net revenue growth and high 20s adjusted operating margins. Our OTC and intimate wellness portfolios in particular have performed very well.... In intimate wellness, we launched Durex Invisible ultra-thin condoms designed to maximize sensitivity.\" However, other portfolios have not performed as well because of which Reckitt Benckiser has seen its share price slip by 1.45% YTD 2023.\nMethodology\nTo determine the most fertile countries in the world, we obtained data from the World Bank showing births per woman by country for 2020 and 2021, the last two years on record. We then calculated the average birth rate of each country for these two years and ranked each country from highest birth rate per woman to lowest.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.05\nGuinea-Bissau has done really well to see a decline in birth rates while also significantly improving child mortality rates, though this decline was reversed in 2022.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.13\nLiberia's population grew by 1.7 million in the 2022 National Census, directly as a result of high birth rates in the country.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.20\nEthiopia has done really well to reduce its birth rate and now women in the country are having a lot fewer children than their mothers, with a major contributing factor being women staying longer in schools.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.20\nRepublic of Congo's high birth rates ensures it remains among the countries with the highest fertility rates in the world right now.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.29\nTogo has seen a stark decline in birth rate considering that its birth rate was even higher than Nigeria's in 1960, and if it continues this way, could even drop off our list in the coming years.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.31\nA lack of female education and empowerment has contributed to the country's high birth rates.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.34\nThe average population of Zambia is young, which leads to higher fertility rates, which in turn leads to an even younger overall population, in a self perpetuating cycle.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.42\nIn low-income countries such as Senegal, more children mean more future providers, which is one of the reasons behind the country's high fertility rate.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.43\nMauritania is home to not just high birth rates but also high maternal death rates, and the government needs to introduce more programs to reduce both, and improve safety for women in the country.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.44\nRecent declines in Guinea's birth rate have been very low, and a lot more needs to be done in this respect.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.45\nThe decline in birth rates in Cote d'Ivoire has slowed down recently, but is still a large decline from 6.6 just over three decades ago.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.50\nSudan has seen birth rates fall significantly from more than 7 in in the 1970s to 4.5 in 2021, but it is still among the countries with the highest fertility rates in the world heading into 2024.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.50\nCameroon is among several African countries which adhere to pro-natalist population policies, explaining the higher fertility rates in the country.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.51\nIn the 12 years since South Sudan gained independence, it has faced a host of challenges, though it has done well to see a strong decline in the last decade in birth rates.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.64\nUganda's government is playing its part in reducing birth rates in Uganda by creating more demand and greater access to family planning services.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.68\nWhile Mozambique saw its fertility rate decline somewhat from 2020 to 2021, it is still a long way away from reaching the rate needed to be in line with economic growth.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.70\nAfghanistan is the only non-African country in our list of the countries with the highest fertility rates in the world heading into 2024.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.73\nIn West Africa, few countries have a higher birth rate than Gambia, with women not afforded the status they deserve and not having the rights they deserve.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.76\nBecause of high poverty levels, many people in Tanzania get married early, which in turn leads to more kids.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.82\nBurkina Faso's fertility rate barely decreased from 2020 to 2021, and more needs to be done by the government to encourage birth control.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.01\nBenin has a relatively high teenage pregnancy rate in the world, with 92 of every 1,000 girls from the ages of 15 to 19 giving birth in the country in 2021.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.13\nWhile the overall world is in a reproduction crisis as global birth rates have fallen significantly, and while still really high, Burundi has also seen its birth rate fall to some extent in the past decade.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.27\nNigeria has done really well to significantly reduce its fertility rate in recent years, but even then, is projected to become among the most populated countries in the world by 2050 as the birth rate is still relatively high.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.34\nA high population of children inevitably follows high birth rates and fertility rates, and Angola had one of the highest number of unvaccinated children in 2022 as a direct consequence, showing how poorer countries with the highest fertility rates in the world can have repercussions for children.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.98\nBecause of high birth rates, around 48% of Central African Republic's population is less than 14 years old, adding significantly more pressure to the economy of the country.\nClick to continue reading the 5 Most Fertile Countries in the World Heading into 2024.

        "text": "\n(Updates prices throughout, includes table on yen options) By Rae Wee SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The battered yen was stuck near a three-decade low against the dollar on Tuesday, struggling to find a floor as the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) ultra-easy monetary policy settings remained at odds with the prospect of higher-for-longer rates elsewhere. The Japanese currency slumped to a 15-year low of 162.38 per euro in early Asia trade and slid to a roughly three-month trough of 186.25 per British pound. Against the dollar, the yen last stood at 151.70, languishing near a one-year low of 151.92 hit on Monday. A break below last year's trough of 151.94 per dollar would mark a fresh 33-year low for the yen. The yen had jumped briefly against the greenback in New York hours on Monday after striking the year-to-date low, which analysts attributed to a flurry of trading in options that come due this week rather than any intervention moves from Japanese authorities. DTCC data from LSEG's Eikon platform shows yen options worth a notional $3.5 billion with strike prices between 151.90 and 152 are due to expire between Wednesday and Friday. \"I think options could continue to act as a resistance for dollar/yen,\" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \"So will fears of further BOJ intervention.\" Japanese authorities in September last year intervened in the currency market to boost the yen for the first time since 1998, after a BOJ decision to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy drove the yen as low as 145 per dollar. It intervened again in October 2022 after the yen plunged to a 32-year low of 151.94. Despite the BOJ's carefully orchestrated steps this year to phase out its controversial yield curve control (YCC) policy and hints of an imminent end to negative interest rates, the piecemeal moves have done little to sustain a rally in the yen, particularly as central banks globally maintain their hawkish rhetoric of higher-for-longer rates. \"I think the market has come to the realisation that the Bank of Japan is going to exit its policy but at a very, very, very slow and cautious pace,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (NAB). INFLATION AND THE FED Outside of Asia, traders also had their attention on U.S. inflation figures due later on Tuesday, which will provide further clarity on whether the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates even further to tame inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his chorus of policymakers have in recent days pushed back against market expectations that the U.S. central bank was done with its aggressive rate-hike cycle after it held rates steady at its latest policy meeting. The comments have kept the U.S. dollar bid and against the greenback, the New Zealand dollar fell to an over one-week low of $0.5866. The kiwi was last 0.17% lower at $0.5867. Sterling eased 0.03% to $1.2274, while the euro gave up 0.03% to trade at $1.0695. \"Overall, the market is also kind of worn out by all messages coming from central banks and the higher-for-longer and wait-and-see mode is keeping volatility low,\" said NAB's Catril. \"We need to wait for that CPI number tonight, which could be a bit of a shaker. If it's strong, then obviously it brings in the idea that another rate hike from the Fed is there.\" The U.S. dollar index rose 0.07% to 105.70. Down Under, the Australian dollar dipped 0.15% to $0.6367. Domestic data was mixed with Australian business conditions holding firm in October, but consumer confidence sliding in the wake of last week's rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The decision was taken \u201cin view of the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians, and Israel\u2019s refusal of calls for cease-fire and continuous and unhindered flow of humanitarian aid,\u201d the ministry said.\nIsrael Says Hamas Attacked During Evacuation Window (6:15 p.m.)\nIsrael\u2019s army said Hamas took advantage of a three-hour window the IDF declared Saturday for civilians to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip, attacking troops with mortars and anti-tank missiles to prevent them from opening a humanitarian corridor. \u201cThis incident further proves that Hamas exploits the Gazan population and prevents them from acting in the interest of their own safety,\u201d the IDF said in a statement on its Telegram channel. No Israeli troops were injured in the attack, the IDF said.\nRead more: Middle East Foreign Ministers Set to Discuss Gaza With Blinken\nUS Says Hamas Demands Delayed Gaza Evacuation Deal (3:30 p.m.)\nThe militant group\u2019s demands to get some of its fighters out of the Gaza Strip as part of a deal to allow the evacuation of foreigners and people with dual nationalities led to delays in finalizing the deal, according to a senior US official.\nHamas wanted some of the Palestinians wounded in Israeli attacks to be transferred to Egypt via the Rafah border crossing, a demand the US didn\u2019t oppose, said the official, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive issues.\nBut about one third of the people put forward by Hamas were actually fighters for the militant group, which the US didn\u2019t consider viable, the official said. Hamas later withdrew the names, and the first people able to leave Gaza under the framework went through Rafah on Wednesday.\nUN Set For $1.2 Billion Donation Appeal for Palestinians (2:45 p.m.)\nThe United Nations is set to make an appeal for $1.2 billion in donations for 2.7 million Palestinians, including the entire population of Gaza.\nThe UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Nov. 6 will issue an appeal for the donations by year-end to meet the needs of 2.2 million people in Gaza and 500,000 in the West Bank.\nAn original appeal made on Oct. 12 asked for $294 million to support nearly 1.3 million people.\nIsraeli Jets Strike Hezbollah Targets After Shooting From Lebanon (2:04 p.m.)\nIsraeli aircraft bombed targets in response to earlier firing from Lebanese territory, alongside strikes using artillery and tanks, the army said.

Israel says 33 of its soldiers have been killed.\nOne clip from the Hamas video released on Wednesday showed fighters running past piles of debris and stopping to fire shoulder-propelled missiles at Israeli tanks. Another showed them shooting rifles from perches behind buildings and dumpsters. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage.\nSaleh al-Arouri, an exiled Hamas commander, told Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV that Israeli forces may gain control of some areas in Gaza.\n\"But that will not stop the resistance's fight against soldiers and tanks. The more (Israel) spreads and expands on the ground, the deeper its losses will become\", he said.\nISRAEL BOMBS TUNNELS\nChief Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Wednesday combat engineers were using explosive devices to destroy Hamas' tunnel network that stretches for hundreds of kilometres (miles) beneath Gaza. The military said it had destroyed 130 tunnel shafts so far.\nIsrael has blamed Hamas for civilian deaths in Gaza, saying that it is using Gazans as human shields and hiding arms and operations centres in residential areas.\nAs the war entered its second month, Israeli troops took foreign reporters to the edges of Gaza City on Wednesday. Journalists saw a devastated landscape where every building within sight was scarred by battle.\nWalls were blown away while bullet holes and shrapnel dotted the facades and palm trees were shredded and broken.\nLieutenant Colonel Ido, deputy commander of the 401st Brigade, who did not give his last name, said that by the time soldiers reached these buildings, all the families had left.\n\"So we know that everyone here is our enemy. We have not seen any civilians here. Only Hamas,\" he said, standing in a badly damaged children's bedroom that was painted pink.\nSoldiers on the press tour said that beneath the family apartment were two floors of workshops used to make weapons, including drones discovered in five wooden boxes. It was not possible to verify the claim.\n50,000 PALESTINIANS HEAD SOUTH\nSome 50,000 Palestinian civilians left the north on Wednesday, Hagari said, during a four-hour window of opportunity announced by Israel. He said they left \"because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the north\".\nThousands still remain inside the encircled north, including at Gaza City's main Al Shifa hospital, where Um Haitham Hejela was sheltering with her young children in an improvised tent.\n\"The situation is getting worse day after day,\" she said. \"There is no food, no water. When my son goes to pick up water, he queues for three or four hours in the line.\"\nThe Israeli military has repeatedly told residents to evacuate the north or risk being trapped in the violence. Huge numbers of displaced people from among Gaza's 2.3 million population are already crammed into schools, hospitals and other sites in the south.\nBut the central and southern parts of the small, besieged Palestinian enclave also came under fire again.\nPalestinian health officials said an airstrike that hit houses in the Nusseirat refugee camp killed 18 people on Wednesday morning. In Khan Younis, six people, including a young girl, were killed in an airstrike.\n\"We were sitting in peace when all of a sudden an F16 airstrike landed on a house and blew it up, the entire block, three houses next to each other,\" said a witness, Mohammed Abu Daqa.\n\"Civilians, all of them civilians. An old woman, an old man and there are others still missing under the rubble.\"\nInternational alarm is mounting over the humanitarian toll of Israel's onslaught. The level of death and suffering is \"hard to fathom\", U.N. health agency spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said in Geneva.\nU.N. officials and G7 world powers stepped up appeals for a humanitarian pause in the war to help alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza, where necessities including food, medicine and fuel are running out.\nNegotiations mediated by Qatar, where several Hamas political leaders are based, are trying to secure the release of 10 to 15 hostages in exchange for a one- to two-day humanitarian pause in Gaza, a source briefed on the talks said on Wednesday.\nPOSSIBLE THIRD STRIKE ON JABALIA\nAt least 19 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house near a hospital in north Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp on Wednesday, the enclave's interior ministry said.\nThere was no immediate Israeli comment or details from the scene of the reported attack, which if confirmed would be the third on Gaza's largest refugee camp in a week.\nPalestinian authorities said at least 195 civilians were killed in those Israeli strikes which flattened multi-storey dwellings.\nIsrael said its air attacks on Jabalia last week killed two Hamas commanders and a number of militants while targeting operational tunnels dug beneath civilian districts.\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza, Maytaal Angel, Emily Rose and Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem, Rami Amichay in Tel Aviv and Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Writing by Angus MacSwan, Mark Heinrich and Cynthia Osterman; Editing by Peter Graff, Alex Richardson, Grant McCool and Howard Goller)",

        "text": "\nBy Jamie McGeever\nDec 1 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\nAsian markets round out the week on Friday in reasonably good spirits, with a deluge of purchasing managers index data from across the continent and a sprinkling of key indicators from Japan, South Korea and Indonesia the most likely market-moving catalysts.\nFriday is also the first trading day of December, so perhaps an opportunity to get the last month of the year off to a positive start. The Dow Jones on Thursday posted its highest close in nearly two years, and if broader market momentum from November spills over, that is a likely scenario - for some Asian stock markets, November was the best month in a long time. On the other hand, Thursday's month-end reversal in the dollar and bonds - the dollar and Treasury yields rose sharply - will sound a loud note of caution. Unemployment data from Japan, trade data from South Korea, and the latest readout on inflation from Indonesia are among the highlights on the Asian economic calendar, along with a raft of purchasing managers index reports from across the region. They include Australia, South Korea and India, as well as China's 'unofficial' PMI. The 'official' PMI report from the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed that manufacturing activity in China shrank for a second month in November, and at a faster rate than had been expected.\nA similar reading on Friday will only enhance the already growing calls for more stimulus.\nChina's leading index of blue chip stocks fell 2% in November, its fourth monthly decline in a row. It is down almost 10% year-to-date, underperforming most of its regional and global peers.\nThe MSCI Asia ex-Japan and emerging market indexes both snapped three-month losing streaks in November, rising 7% or more for their best month since January, while Japan's Nikkei gained 8.5% for its best month in three years.\nThe general gloom surrounding China's economy and financial markets shows little sign of lifting, despite some sporadic positive surprises recently like the strong third quarter GDP growth figures. A survey by central banking think tank OMFIF of 22 public pension and sovereign wealth funds managing $4.3 trillion in assets, showed that none reported a positive outlook for China's economy. They cited the regulatory environment and geopolitics among primary factors dissuading them from investing. Foreigners already appear to be voting with their feet - China just recorded its first-ever quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment.\nAs more aggressive Fed rate cut expectations chip away at the U.S. dollar, investors are turning more bullish on Asian currencies, a Reuters poll found. Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the few exceptions is the Chinese yuan.\nStill, the yuan is trading around its strongest level against the dollar since June and just clocked its biggest monthly gain in a year, rising around 2.5% in November.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday:\n- PMIs for Australia, South Korea, India, China\n- Japan unemployment (October)\n- Indonesia inflation (October)\n(By Jamie McGeever Editing by Josie Kao)",

        "text": "\nHANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 To meet the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), nine major Asian economies must increase the share of electricity they get from renewable energy from the current 6% to at least 50% by 2030, according to a report by a German thinktank released Wednesday.\nNearly a third of that renewable energy should come from wind and solar power, said the report by researchers of Berlin-based Agora Energiewende. A fifth would be hydropower and other clean sources and the remainder, fossil fuels.\nThe study analyzed energy plans of both developing nations like Indonesia and Vietnam, where demand for energy is growing rapidly, and wealthier places like Japan and South Korea, which have among the highest burdens of per capita greenhouse gas emissions. It did not include China, the world's biggest emitter of carbon, or India, another major contributor.\nA global temperature increase of 1.5C (2.7F) since pre-industrial times is considered a critical climate threshold beyond which risks of catastrophes rise. The world will likely lose most of its coral reefs, a key ice sheet could kick into irreversible melt, and water shortages, heat waves and death from extreme weather may surge, according to an earlier United Nations scientific report.\nAgora Energiewende researchers found that Asian nations are united in their heavy reliance on fossil fuels and national plans are not aligned with ambitious climate pledges announced by their governments.\nBy using proven technologies like wind and solar power, countries can avoid exceeding limits they have set and also limit investment in fossil fuel infrastructure they won't need, said Mathis Rogner, the Southeast Asia project lead for Agora Energiewende and a co-author of the report.\nTo conform with 1.5C (2.7F) limit, the nine countries included in the study need to add 45 to 55 gigawatts of solar energy and 20 gigawatts of wind energy every year. In 2021, they had installed a total of just 11.9 gigawatts of solar energy and 1.5 gigawatts of wind energy.\nThe study reviewed energy plans of Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Taiwan.\nAs of the end of 2022, the U.S. had installed capacity of more than 144 GW of wind power and 110 GW of solar photovoltaic power.\nThe need for urgent action was echoed by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for a \u201cclimate ambition supernova\u201d after a U.N. analysis released Tuesday found that countries\u2019 climate plans still lagged far behind what was needed.\nMuch of the clean energy capacity the world has added since 2016 has been concentrated in the U.S., China and India. Even though wind and solar technologies have been getting cheaper every year, among other Asian nations, only Japan and Vietnam derive more than a tenth of their capacity from the wind and the sun.\nThe vast increases in Chinese and Indian renewable energy capacity are an example for other Asian countries that lag behind. They also show how such transitions can create jobs and improve energy security, said Kanika Chawla, chief of staff at Sustainable Energy for All, the United Nations\u2019 sustainable energy unit, who was not involved in the report.\nMany countries still rely heavily on large hydropower dams, which can involve hefty social and environmental costs and are vulnerable to drought.\nThe report estimates that South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia each should add between 8 and 14 gigawatts of solar power annually. Indonesia now gets less than 1% of its power from wind and solar energy, according to a study by the U.K.-based thinktank Ember. South Korea and Thailand also still mostly depend on fossil fuel.\nJapan needs to add an average of 9 gigawatts of solar power a year and Vietnam, around 10 gigawatts, to meet end-of-the-decade targets. But the report says the goals are achievable since both countries have managed similar increases in the past.\nThe report says Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines need to add between 1 and 3 gigawatts of energy from the sun each year to their grid.\nSouth Korea needs the biggest spurt in wind power \u2014 an average increase of 8 gigawatts each year \u2014 while Japan needs to add about 3 gigawatts. Vietnam should be deploying around 4 gigawatts in new wind power capacity, the report said.\nLower potential for wind power in other countries means they should target between one and 2 gigawatts each year.\nThe report calls for a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d to speed up the transition to wind and solar power. That would include removing subsidies for oil and gas that make renewables less competitive, simplifying bureaucratic hurdles such as permits and facilitating investments.\nAt the same time, power grids need to be upgraded to allow for the variability and unpredictability of wind and solar power, it said.\nDespite a common misconception that wind and solar are more expensive and less stable than fossil fuel-powered generation, \u201cOur analysis shows that often much higher shares of wind and solar can be reliably integrated into the power system than the operators expect,\u201d Rogner of Agora said.\n___\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

So, don't touch the Camembert \u2014 never, ever.\nOn Wednesday, legislators at the European Parliament made sure it won't happen anytime soon.\nTucked in a proposal on streamlining and optimizing waste management throughout the 27-nation bloc, some French cheese producers in recent weeks sniffed out something and turned it into a culinary stink.\nThey claimed that the proposal's wording would make it illegal for the famous cheese to be cradled into its usual wooden packaging for its final weeks of ripening and, eventually, sale. The round box is as essentially Camembert as its unctuous texture and pungent smell.\nSuddenly, there was a frenzied flutter that something fundamentally French would fall foul of the Brussels bureaucrats \u2014 derisively known by many as Eurocrats \u2014 who are all too often blamed for flaws real and false.\n\u201cIt is a matter of common sense. Don\u2019t touch our Camemberts!\u201d said Jean-Paul Garraud, a member of the European Parliament for France\u2019s far-right Rassemblement National.\nThe reasoning was this: If Camembert were forced into something easier to recycle like plastic, the perfect breathing of the cheese through wood might instead produce something sweaty and flabby. Wood, however, is hard to recycle sustainably, and the EU wants to remove it from food packaging as much as possible.\nEnvironment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius said ahead of Wednesday's vote that the EU would make sure that the raw-milk specialized non-industrial Camemberts \u2014 those with a controlled designation of origin \u2014 will be exempt from any such regulation.\nEven Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the French World War II hero and later president of the nation, knew all about such gourmet sensitivities. \u201cHow do you want to run a country that has 246 kinds of cheese,\u201d he was quoted as complaining.\nWednesday's action proved that cheese can be an effective binding agent, as European legislators ranging from free-trade liberals to the far-right made sure that an amendment to allow wooden boxes in case of exceptional circumstances would survive.\n\u201cWe have saved our Camemberts,\u201d said French free-trade Renew Europe legislator Valerie Hayer after the vote. And she said others will be safe under the measure: \u201cCamembert, Pont l\u2019\u00c9v\u00eaque or Mont d\u2019Or will be well protected.\"\nThe center-right European People's Party, the biggest group in the European Parliament with a traditional farming electorate and penchant for heritage protection, led the defense of the wooden boxes for Camembert and other cheeses.\n\u201cWho can imagine a Camembert or a Mont d\u2019Or without its wooden strapping? Packaging them in plastic would be a gustatory and environmental aberration,\" said French MEP Laurence Sailliet.\n\u201cEurope must know how to protect the environment, but never to the detriment of the specific characteristics of its member states,\u201d she added.\nAnd food is one of the touchiest characteristics for sure.\nThe British used anti-EU food foment to the extreme in the years leading up to Brexit, with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then still a Brussels journalist, leading the tabloid assault with stories that the EU would insist that bananas would have to be straight and eliminate beloved British biscuits.\nIt helped turn the United Kingdom against the EU, and voters decided in a referendum to leave.",

Unemployment is predicted to peak at 4.25% at end-2024 and then hold at that level through the following year.\n\u201cThe domestic economy has proved more resilient than previously expected, and the labor market is expected to ease more gradually as a result,\u201d the RBA said of its forecasts, which are based on a cash rate assumed to peak at around 4.5%. \u201cThe prospect of higher inflation over the year ahead increases the risk of embedding higher inflation expectations in price-setting decisions.\u201d\nThe central bank ended a four-meeting pause on Tuesday to hike the cash rate to a 12-year high of 4.35% in order to try to rein in prices.\nThe RBA\u2019s restating of much of what it said in Tuesday\u2019s rate statement saw Australian three-year government bonds rebound to pare declines. The yield on the notes was at 4.23%, up 7 basis points on the day, after trading at 4.25% before the statement.\nMany economists including at Commonwealth Bank of Australia now predict the RBA has probably finished hiking, though National Australia Bank and Royal Bank of Canada are among a handful that see at least one more hike to 4.6%. Money market bets imply rates will remain above 4% over the next year.\n\u201cThe board\u2019s priority is to return inflation to target,\u201d the RBA said. \u201cWhether further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe will depend upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks,\u201d it said, reiterating Tuesday\u2019s statement.\nThe RBA said it will continue to closely monitor the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labor market in making its decisions.\n\u201cOn face value, the new forecasts set leans hawkish given the size of the near-term revisions and indicates the RBA is further from its targets than previously thought,\u201d said Tom Kennedy at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\u201cBut upgrades were widely expected heading into the release, and the leadership had nevertheless chosen to slightly raise the bar for further tightening with this week\u2019s guidance changes,\u201d he said.\nInflation remains above 5% in year-ended terms, \u201cwell above\u201d the target, the central bank noted. It said services-price strength is likely to persist for a while driven by labor market tightness and rising energy costs. Rent inflation is also set to remain high as surging population growth in recent quarters adds to demand in an already tight market.\nAnother factor adding to inflation is wage growth, which is seen peaking at 4% this year, from 4.1% forecast in August, and holding at that level in the first half of 2024 before easing thereafter. The RBA highlighted persistent poor productivity growth among upside risks to inflation. On the other hand, declines in global cost pressures and tepid inflation in China could bring down overall consumer prices.\nAustralia\u2019s housing market has staged a surprising turnaround, rising for consecutive months since February amid the combined effects of high demand buoyed partly by strong population growth and limited supply. In addition, construction activity continues to be limited by capacity constraints because of labor shortages and a tightening of financial conditions.\nThe RBA highlighted household consumption as a \u201ckey source\u201d of uncertainty, though a resilient labor market and higher house prices are likely to support sentiment. It added that spending in the economy has been supported by a rebound in international students and tourists.\n--With assistance from Swati Pandey and Garfield Reynolds.\n(Adds comment from economist in ninth-10th paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

That will open the door for both central banks to begin \u201ca gradual easing\u201d in monetary policy from late next year.\nGoldman\u2019s take sharply contrasts with forecasts from Australia\u2019s central bank which raised interest rates just last week to a 12-year-high of 4.35%, predicting CPI will overshoot its 2-3% target until mid-2025. On Monday, Reserve Bank of Australia Acting Assistant Governor Marion Kohler said the next stage of bringing inflation back to target is likely to be more \u201cdrawn out.\u201d\nGoldman does see upside risks to inflation for Australia driven by a combination of stronger-than-expected wages growth, ongoing weak productivity, rising energy costs and persistently strong housing prices.\n\u201cOur working assumption is that the RBA remains a \u2018reluctant hiker\u2019 and their reaction function does not change materially in the near term,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cHowever, we caution that several important decisions on RBA board appointments and implementation of the RBA review are imminent,\u201d\nNew Zealand\u2019s central bank has hiked at a much more rapid pace than the RBA, taking its official cash rate to 5.5%.\nEven so, the downside risks to New Zealand\u2019s economic growth have eased, Goldman said, though recent inflation and labor force reports \u201chave strengthened our conviction that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will remain on hold well into 2024.\u201d\nBased on its latest forecasts published in August, the RBNZ sees inflation returning to its 1-3% target in the third quarter of 2024.\nThere are risks to the RBNZ\u2019s reaction function too, Goldman said, given an election pledge by the National Party, which will lead the next government, to remove the maximum sustainable employment component of the RBNZ\u2019s existing dual mandate.\n\u201cThe balance of risks to our RBA/RBNZ base case is skewed to higher rates in the near term,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cConsistent with our global economic team\u2019s approach, we have also revised higher our longer run RBA/RBNZ rate forecasts by +50-basis-points to 3.50%.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Investors are beginning to sniff an opportunity where the rating agencies see trouble \u2014 Chile\u2019s Falabella SA.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nRussia Downs Drones Over Moscow in Ukrainian Retaliatory Strike\nBillions Wiped Out as Stock-Safety Trade on Wall Street Misfires\nMusk, Netanyahu Visit Massacre Site Amid Antisemitism Furor\nTreasuries Rise After US Sales on Dovish Fed Bets: Markets Wrap\nSodium in Batteries: Shift May Herald Another Shakeup\nJust days after the company, which owns malls, department stores and supermarkets, unveiled plans to reduce its debt load and return to profitability, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings both cut the company to junk last week. The bonds due 2032 dropped 2.53 cents on the dollar to 70.59 cents in the week.\nBut with the notes now hovering just above record lows, investors are taking a more benevolent view of the retailer that racked up losses after investing heavily in e-commerce amid stiff competition and weak consumer spending. Plans to sell as much as $1 billion in assets may have left the rating agencies cold, but they impressed some bondholders.\n\u201cIn the longer term, it\u2019s a great story,\u201d said Elizabeth Bakarich, an emerging markets corporate debt portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, who noted there is not much in the corporate bond space in Chile that is high yield. \u201cAt these spreads we\u2019re interested in the opportunity it creates.\u201d\nBakarich manages an emerging markets debt portfolio that includes Falabella bonds due in 2027.\nDebt Load\n\u201cWe are working with a sense of urgency to strengthen our financial position,\u201d Falabella said in a response to emailed questions. \u201cWe hope that our attempts to boost efficiency, combined with the normalization of the macro environment and the sale of assets, will enable us to recover investment grade as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe company has seen its total debt to Ebitda increase steadily since 2021. The ratio now stands at 7.32, compared with 3.8 and 5.97 at local peers Cencosud SA and Parque Arauco SA, respectively.\nYet plans to unload assets, starting with a 66.6% stake in mall operator Mall Plaza Peru, should start to ease that debt burden next year. Falabella plans to sell the unit to another of its subsidiaries Mall Plaza.\n\u201cWith the 10-year yields at almost 8% for Falabella, I consider it a good level to enter,\u201d said Nicolas Morande, partner at wealth advisory firm Damon Capital.\nStill, the bonds could get worse before they get better. The double downgrade means funds with only investment grade bonds will now have to sell. At the same time, both rating agencies kept the company outlook at negative, indicating more cuts are possible.\nThe bonds had priced in the downgrade, but not the negative outlook, said Josefina Valdivia, fixed income manager at Credicorp Capital.\nAll the same, the downward pressure on the bonds may be muted as forced selling by investment grade funds might only impact 8.8% and 7.6% of the amount outstanding of the 2027 and 2032 notes, respectively, JPMorgan analyst Eugenia Cavalheiro wrote in a note to clients in September. JPMorgan said last week that no new analysis was available on the exposure to these funds.\nAchilles Heel\nBakarich says investors don\u2019t think the company has a liquidity issue and doesn\u2019t need to raise fresh capital. Its Achilles heel is communication.\n\u201cThe company has deleveraging plans, but they weren\u2019t as specific as they needed to be in terms of those assets, what their timeline was and what their leverage targets were over the near term,\u201d Bakarich said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely more that they could have done to inform the broader market.\u201d\nCredicorp\u2019s Valdivia says Falabella also needs to make more structural, strategic changes, such as reducing capital expenditure. And if Mall Plaza has to issue debt to finance the purchase of Mall Plaza Peru, it won\u2019t help delevarage Falabella as it has a controlling stake, she said.\nIf the businesses continues to deteriorate, there could be another downgrade, and recovering their investment grade would take a long time, Valdivia said. Their goal should be to get a \u201cpositive\u201d outlook in the next six to 12 months.\nUncertainty over who will succeed Gaston Bottazzini as CEO could also weigh on the bonds. Bottazzini resigned in September after the plunge into losses.\nThe new management has \u201cto give confidence,\u201d Bakarich said. \u201cA new CEO needs to inspire that.\u201d\nAt the same time, investors need to understand the company is cyclical and be patient to see results of the cost reductions, she said.\n\u201cWe believe their willingness to bring this back to investment grade is high,\u201d Bakarich said. \u201cWe think their plan is credible and we think that they have the ability to execute on it.\u201d\nECONOMIC CALENDAR:\nAll events in Santiago local time.\nChile\nNov. 29 9am: October Unemployment Rate\nNov. 30 9am: October Copper Production Total\nNov. 30 9am: October Retail Sales\nDec. 1 8:30am: October Economic Activity\nInternational\nUS\nNov. 27: New Home Sales\nNov. 28: Conf.

        "text": "\nTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) \u2014 Perhaps just shaking hands and sitting down together can be enough sometimes.\nAt their four-hour meeting Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping didn't resolve any of the vital geopolitical issues dividing the world's two largest economies and chief rivals for global influence, but they struck a conciliatory tone that came as a relief to other countries, especially China's neighbors.\nThe two leaders met at a northern California country estate, holding talks, lunching and taking a garden stroll designed to show that while the two countries are global competitors, they\u2019re not locked in a winner-take-all faceoff.\n\u201cPlanet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed,\u201d Xi told Biden.\nBiden emphasized the need to avoid miscommunication. \"We have to ensure competition does not veer into conflict,\u201d he said.\nThe leaders' first face-to-face encounter in a year appears to have put a floor under a relationship that at times has seemed to be in freefall over various issues, from trade and technology to U.S. support for Taiwan, China's human rights record and even the source of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTaiwan's Foreign Ministry appeared to welcome the warming of relations, noting the U.S. had again laid down the bottom line that China must use peaceful means in dealing with the self-governed island that Beijing claims as its own territory, to be taken by force if it deems it necessary.\n\"We express our affirmation and welcome for President Biden again making use of the venue of a meeting with the leader of China to again openly press the strict U.S. position insisting on peace in the Taiwan Strait,\" spokesperson Jeff Liu said.\nSouth Koreans watched the meeting with a mixture of hope and skepticism. Living with a growing nuclear threat from rival North Korea, the South primarily focuses on ensuring its security through its crucial military and diplomatic ally, the U.S. Seoul has chafed at Beijing\u2019s unwillingness to back stronger sanctions and pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs at the U.N. Security Council.\nBut South Korea's largest trading partner is China, and the Biden's administration's steps to restrict sales of advanced chip technologies to China set off furious lobbying to minimize the impact on South Korean semiconductor makers like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix.\nIn an editorial on Thursday, South Korea\u2019s Kookmin Ilbo newspaper said a meaningful improvement in U.S.-China relations would have major consequences to global supply chains and the \u201ccomposition of the new Cold War between North Korea-China-Russia and South Korea-U.S.-Japan.\u201d\nDuring this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, being held in San Francisco, Japanese officials have focused more on trying to arrange a meeting between Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Xi to help persuade Beijing to lift a ban on imports of Japanese seafood due to the release of treated wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant.\nSeafood exports are just one element in Tokyo's often fraught ties with China, where anti-Japan sentiment left over from before and during World War II is at times fanned to promote loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. Tokyo and Beijing have long feuded over ownership of unpopulated East China Sea islands and underwater mineral deposits.\nBefore leaving for California, Kishida told reporters a meeting with Xi had not yet been decided on.\n\"We plan to have various forms of communication,\u201d he said.\nBack in China, the state-run media curated Xi's talks with Biden to highlight China's stature as a global equal to the United States, said Madoka Fukuda, a professor of international politics and China studies at Tokyo's Hosei University.\n\u201cChina is stressing to its own people that the country is a global power that serves an important role in the international community, prompting their nationalism at home,\u201d she said.\nThe aura of goodwill generated by the meeting was marred somewhat, however, by a comment by Biden. When pressed by a reporter to say whether he trusted Xi, he said he believed in trusting but verifying, and conceded that China\u2019s leader is a dictator.\n\u201cHe is a dictator in a sense,\u201d Biden said.\nThat drew a stout response from a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, who said, \u201cSuch a remark is extremely wrong and is irresponsible political manipulation.\u201d\n\u201cIt needs to be pointed out that there have always been people with ill intentions who try to sow discord and undermine the China-U.S. relations,\" she said.\nMao reaffirmed China's position that the U.S. should not provide Taiwan with armaments or back its independent role in international affairs. But she affirmed that the meeting in San Francisco was an important step to \"enhance trust, dispel misgiving, control differences and expand cooperation between China and the U.S.\"\n\"It is also an important meeting to inject certainty and enhance stability into a turbulent and changing world,\" she said. \u201cBut San Francisco is not the end, and it should become a new starting point.\u201d\nBeijing residents asked about the meeting said they hoped for a relaxation of tensions with the U.S., where tens of thousands of Chinese students travel to study each year and an untold number have settled down for work.\n\u201cI feel that China-U.S. relations have eased, and maybe the next step will be cooperation,\u201d said Xu Jiaguang a 31-year-old firefighter. He echoed a comment by Biden that only by sitting face-to-face can potential adversaries find common ground and said he hoped the tete-a-tete would be \"a great help.\u201d\nTensions with the United States have the \u201cbiggest impact on ordinary people,\u201d said Gao Kexin, 23, a Beijing hospital worker. \"I hope the relationship can be eased, so that people can live a happier life,\u201d he said.\nWhile tensions appear to have cooled, the two sides remain in contention over which is calling the shots in the relationship, said Zhao Minghao, a professor of international relations at Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University.\n\u201cThe Biden administration has been attempting to exhibit that they are the dominator of the pace of China-U.S. relations, making the outside world feel that it is China that doesn\u2019t want to cooperate and communicate,\" Zhao said.\n\u201cThere has been a big change this time and China hopes to show that Beijing is committed to responsibly managing China-U.S. relations,\u201d Zhao said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Kim Tong-Hyung in Seoul, South Korea and video producer Caroline Chen in Beijing contributed to this report.",

        "text": "\nBy Jamie McGeever\nNov 9 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist.\nAttention in Asia on Wednesday turns to Chinese inflation data, with investors expecting disinflationary pressures to have picked up in October but not at such a pace that would deflate the recent rebound in optimism about the economic recovery.\nProducer and consumer price inflation figures will be released, the highlights of a regional calendar that also includes Japanese bank lending, trade and current account figures, Indonesian retail sales, and Philippines GDP. Asian markets open on Thursday to a fairly benign global backdrop. U.S. bond yields continue to slide, oil prices are the lowest since July - WTI crude is down 20% from its September peak - and Wall Street is resisting profit-taking pressure to hold onto its recent gains.\nA solid 10-year U.S. Treasury bond auction on Wednesday helped extend this week's sweeping rally that is driving yields down across the curve. Global yields are moving too - the 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield is back below 0.85%, having come within two basis points of 1% last week.\nThe decline in U.S. bond yields is removing some of the dollar's shine, which in turn is allowing Asian currencies to fight back. China's yuan this week, for example, is the strongest in more than two months, enjoying a reprieve from the heavy downward pressure of recent months.\nPeople's Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng said Beijing will resolutely guard against the yuan overshooting, according to a report in the Financial News, a newspaper owned by the PBOC, and a growing number of global asset managers may be taking more of a shine to Chinese assets.\nFigures on Thursday are expected to show annual producer price deflation accelerating slightly to -2.7% from -2.5% in September, snapping a run of three months of improvement. Annual consumer inflation is also expected to slip back to -0.1% from 0.0%. Another choppy day in China's property sector awaits after Ping An Insurance Group shares slumped to a one-year low on Wednesday after Reuters reported Chinese authorities had asked the firm to take a controlling stake in troubled developer Country Garden.\nIn Japan, meanwhile, among the big companies releasing their latest reports on Thursday are Nissan, Honda, Sony and the wider Softbank Group.\nThe yen remains vulnerable too, slipping further below the psychologically key 150 per dollar level. It is now trading near 151.00 per dollar and in sight of the 152.00 mark that many analysts think might be the threshold for direct yen-buying intervention from Japanese authorities.\nYen traders on Thursday are also eyeing Japanese bank lending figures for October and September's trade and current account report.\nThe Philippine peso will be highly sensitive to the country's third quarter GDP report. The central bank said on Oct. 26 that Q3 annual growth will likely be around 4.5%.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:\n- China PPI and CPI inflation (October)\n- Japan trade and current account (October)\n- Fed's Powell speaks\n(By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)",

The automaker provided a long-awaited update on pricing and specifications, estimating the base version will cost $60,990, up more than 50% from the cheapest option floated four years ago. It won\u2019t be available until 2025.\nTesla is taking reservations for that vehicle and two configurations that it will deliver next year, which cost an estimated $79,990 and $99,990. The version offering the most battery range will go about 340 miles on a charge, well short of the more than 500 miles the company touted four years ago.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more expensive than I thought,\u201d said Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cThey need to get production up to get the price down, and they know they can\u2019t produce a lot of them next year. The reality is that the Cybertruck isn\u2019t really out yet.\u201d\nTesla shares fell as much as 2.1% before the start of regular trading Friday. The stock climbed almost 20% last month in anticipation of the event, which was live-streamed on X, the social media platform Musk owns.\nThe Cybertruck marks Tesla\u2019s entry into the lucrative and highly competitive pickup market in the US, a move that\u2019s been met with a mix of excitement, criticism and doubt. One analyst suggested last week that the automaker should cancel the truck altogether, arguing it will be a drag on profit and divert resources. Musk himself has lamented that producing the pickup will be \u201cinsanely difficult.\u201d\nThe CEO mostly focused on the merits of the Cybertruck during the delivery event, in contrast to his emphasis on manufacturing challenges during Tesla\u2019s last earnings call. He did say that part of the reason for the pickup\u2019s angular shape is that its stainless-steel body panels can\u2019t be stamped, claiming they would break stamping machines.\nWhen Tesla started taking deposits for the Cybertruck in 2019, it marketed a starting price of $39,900 for a single-motor version and more than 500 miles of range for a tri-motor configuration. A demonstration of the pickup\u2019s transparent-metal glass went awry, with design chief Franz von Holzhausen shattering a window with a metal ball.\nThis time around, the Cybertruck withstood von Holzhausen throwing a baseball at the front passenger-side window. \u201cWe could probably have a pro pitcher lob it at it,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThe glass is tough, basically, is what we\u2019re saying.\u201d\nTesla claimed the Cybertruck will reach 60 miles per hour in as little as 2.6 seconds, and showed a video of the pickup crossing a quarter mile quicker than a Porsche 911 \u2014 while also pulling one of the sports cars on a trailer.\nThe company said the pickup can tow up to 11,000 pounds, more than a battery-powered Ford F-150 Lightning and some gas-powered F-150 models. The Cybertruck also boasts 17 inches of ground clearance, more than all versions of the F-150 and the electric Rivian R1T pickup.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically an incredibly useful truck,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just some grandstanding showpiece, like me.\u201d\nStill, the cheapest Cybertruck will be thousands of dollars more than the commercial grade electric F-150 \u2014 which starts at $49,995 \u2014 as well as the base retail model starting at $54,995.\nIn July, Musk posted on X that the F-150 Lightning was \u201ca good vehicle, just somewhat expensive.\u201d\nThe high-end version of Tesla\u2019s pickup, called Cyberbeast, will be able to get more than 440 miles of range by adding an additional toolbox-size battery against the back of the cab in the bed.\nTesla\u2019s Cybertruck website offers details Musk didn\u2019t get into during his presentation, including the size of front (18.5-inch) and rear (9.4-inch) touch screens and the number of speakers (15). The pickup also will offer bidirectional charging, meaning the battery can be used to power homes, power tools and other devices \u2014 including other EVs.\n--With assistance from Esha Dey.\n(Updates with early trading in the fifth paragraph.

CPI slightly cools * FX drop 1%, stocks down 0.5% By Siddarth S Nov 10 (Reuters) - Latin American assets marched southward on Friday and were set for weekly declines as risk appetite received a thumbs down after a hawkish rhetoric from the U.S. Federal Chair Jerome Powell fanned fears of further rate hikes. The MSCI's gauge for South American equities shed 0.5% by 1512 GMT and was set for weekly declines of 0.5%, if losses hold. A basket of regional currencies weakened 1.0% against a steady dollar and was on track for weekly losses of more than 1%. A bout of jitters ran through markets on Thursday after a weaker-than-expected 30-year bond auction and a hawkish message from Powell pushed the dollar and yields on 10-year Treasury bills higher. Fed officials including Powell said on Thursday they are still not sure interest rates are high enough to finish the battle with inflation. Latam stocks and FX had a flying start in the first week of November as markets started pricing in rate cuts next year following Fed's decision to keep rates steady last week and a less hawkish tone from Powell. The rally was short lived as things took a U-turn following hints of further rate hikes from Fed policymakers earlier this week and the hawkish tilt was cemented further by Powell's speech on Thursday. Andres Abadia, chief Latin America economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said despite the Fed having \"some sort\" of a hawkish view, they will continue to keep interest rates on hold. \"Market sentiment right now is that interest rates in the developed world would probably remain stable and we'll probably see interest rate cuts by the Fed in the spring and that will support Latam markets. That's the central view, less of all volatility in the near term,\" Abadia added. Brazil's October consumer prices slightly cooled as prices rose 0.24% just below market forecasts of 0.29%. Brazil's benchmark stock index Ibovespa climbed 1.0%, while the real inched up 0.1%. Chile's central bank is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate by another 75 basis points to 8.25% at its next monetary policy meeting next month, a poll of analysts released by the bank showed on Friday. Chilean shares slipped 0.2%. On Thursday, Peru's central bank again lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.00%, while Bank of Mexico held its benchmark interest at 11.25% as expected. Among corporate earnings, shares of Banco Bradesco fell 1.3% after a disappointing third-quarter results on Thursday. Emerging market debt funds suffered outflows in the past fifteen weeks, bleeding $53 million in the latest week ending Nov. 8, while EM equity funds lost $1.2 billion in investment flows, its fifth consecutive week of outflows, according to BofA Global Research. Down south, Argentina's pollsters say the Nov. 19 presidential run-off between radical outsider Javier Milei and government economy chief Sergio Massa could go either way, although Milei has a slight advantage.

        "text": "\nElon Musk\u2019s social media company X filed a lawsuit against liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America on Monday, saying it manufactured a report to show advertisers\u2019 posts alongside neo-Nazi and white nationalist posts in order to \u201cdrive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp.\u201d\nMedia Matters, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit, called the lawsuit \u201cfrivolous.\u201d\nAdvertisers have been fleeing the site formerly known as Twitter over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content \u2014 and hate speech on the site in general \u2014 while billionaire owner Musk has inflamed tensions with his own posts endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory.\nIBM, NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast said last week that they stopped advertising on X after the Media Matters report said their ads were appearing alongside material praising Nazis. It was a fresh setback as the platform tries to win back big brands and their ad dollars, X\u2019s main source of revenue.\nThe Media Matters report pointed to ads from Apple and Oracle that also were placed next to antisemitic material on X. On Friday, it said it also found ads from Amazon, NBA Mexico, NBCUniversal and others next to white nationalist hashtags.\nBut San Francisco-based X says in its complaint filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, that Media Matters \u201cknowingly and maliciously\u201d portrayed ads next to hateful material \u201cas if they were what typical X users experience on the platform.\u201d\nX's complaint claims that Media Matters manipulated algorithms on the platform to create images of advertisers' paid posts next to racist, incendiary content. The juxtapositions, according to the complaint, were \"manufactured, inorganic and extraordinarily rare.\"\nIt says Media Matters did this by using X accounts that just followed X users known to produce \u201cextreme fringe content\u201d and accounts owned by X\u2019s major advertisers. This, the complaint says, led to a feed aimed at producing side-by-side placements that Media Matters could then screen shot in an effort to alienate X's advertisers.\nMedia Matters said Monday that it stands by its reporting and expects to prevail in court.\n\u201cThis is a frivolous lawsuit meant to bully X\u2019s critics into silence,\" the non-profit's president, Angelo Carusone, said in a prepared statement.\nMeanwhile, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced his office is launching an investigation into Media Matters for possible fraudulent activity related to the group\u2019s report.\nAdvertisers have been skittish on X since Musk's takeover more than a year ago.\nMusk has also sparked outcry this month with his own posts responding to a user who accused Jews of hating white people and professing indifference to antisemitism. \u201cYou have said the actual truth,\u201d Musk tweeted in a reply last Wednesday.\nMusk has faced accusations of tolerating antisemitic messages on the platform since purchasing it last year, and the content on X has gained increased scrutiny since the war between Israel and Hamas began.\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino said the company's \u201cpoint of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should STOP across the board.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s something we can and should all agree on,\u201d she wrote on the platform last week.",

The company\u2019s 67.4 trillion won ($50 billion) revenue for the last quarter was a 12.2% drop from a year earlier.\nSamsung said the operating losses from its semiconductor business fell from 4.36 trillion won ($3.2 billion) in the second quarter to 3.75 trillion won ($2.78 billion) for the July-September period.\nIt said the improvements in demand have been driven by high-end chips used for artificial intelligence technologies and resumed orders from PC and mobile device manufacturers, which had previously focused on lowering their chip inventory while weathering weak consumer spending.\nIt also said it expects to spend a record 53.7 trillion won in capital expenditure this year, including 47.5 trillion won on chips, to prepare for mid-to-long term demand increase.\n\u201cOverall memory demand is expected to recover gradually thanks to increasing demand for AI and normalizing inventory levels at customers, but various factors that can affect the server market \u2014 such as geopolitical issues and spending trends that are related to macroeconomic conditions and centered on generative AI \u2014 need to be continuously monitored,\u201d Samsung said in a statement.",

The figures missed expectations for a gain of 25,000 positions and a jobless rate of 5.6% in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\nWage growth for permanent employees slowed to 5%, missing expectations for a 5.2% gain, but still the fourth straight month of pay raises of 5% or more.\nThe loonie rose to session highs after the release of both Canadian and US employment data, up 0.2% to 1.3705 at 8:45 a.m. in Ottawa. The yield on Canadian government two-year bonds fell as much as 10 basis points.\nThe data paints a clearer picture of an economy that\u2019s gearing down, with the pace of job gains running below labor force growth from record population increases. It\u2019s another sign labor demand is cooling while supply is catching up quickly. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem expects the economy to move into modest excess supply in the fourth quarter, helping to slow consumer price inflation.\nMacklem and his officials paused their interest-rate increases for two straight meetings in September and October, and over that period several data releases point to an economy that\u2019s rapidly slowing, despite persistent underlying price pressures. Policymakers are counting on a weaker economy to help ease inflation in the coming months as they wait and watch.\n\u201cThis keeps the BoC very much sidelined into 2024, but we\u2019ll need to see further softening to see rate cut talk ramp up,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, a rates and macro strategist at the Bank of Montreal, said by email.\nEarlier this week, preliminary industry-based data suggested gross domestic product was flat in September, pointing to a 0.1% annualized decline in output for the third quarter. That would follow a 0.2% contraction from April to June, based on expenditure-based data.\nIn October, total hours worked were unchanged on a monthly basis and up 2.1% compared to a year earlier. That also points to relatively weak momentum at the beginning of the fourth quarter, when economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect GDP to expand at a 0.1% annualized pace.\nRate Expectations\nThis is the first of two jobs reports before the Bank of Canada\u2019s next decision on Dec. 6. A majority of economists expect Macklem to hold the overnight rate steady at 5%, a likely end point in this tightening cycle.\nTraders in overnight swaps brought forward their expectations for when the Bank of Canada will start loosening policy, and are now betting policymakers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points in July, from September a day ago.\nCanada is experiencing record population growth due to high levels of immigration. Since January, employment growth has averaged 28,000 per month, while growth in the population aged 15 and older has averaged 81,000 per month.\nThe participation rate held steady at 65.6%. The employment rate \u2014 the proportion of the working-age population that\u2019s employed \u2014 fell 0.1 percentage point to 61.9% in October, as the population aged 15 and older increased by 85,000, or 0.3%.\nJob gains were led by increases in construction, information and recreation, and the health care sector. Wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing and real estate industries saw the biggest losses.\nEmployment rose in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but it fell in Quebec and was little changed in the other provinces.\n--With assistance from Chris Middleton and Carter Johnson.\n(Updates with market and economist reaction.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nShipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\nFoxconn Makes Your iPhone.

The first of five lines at the 325,000-square-foot plant began production in mid September, about two years after construction began, and a second line was put into service earlier this month.\n\u201cThis brand new Danville facility represents a pivotable move in our company\u2019s history,\u201d Tyson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Donnie King said Tuesday at a ribbon-cutting event at the plant. \u201cIt represents a strategic growth drive, which is key for us as we continue to build positive momentum and drive profitability in our business.\u201d\nTyson is seeking to expand its value-added business, which is typically seen as more resilient in economic downturns, as part of efforts to accelerate long-term growth.

Among the factors behind the move was an improving spread between 10-year Italian and German bonds, a key measure of risk in the region, said the people who asked not to be named on a confidential issue.\nSuccessive governments have long tried to find a way to sell a controlling stake in Paschi. The bank was first bailed out in 2009 after it was hit by souring loans and derivatives deals that backfired. In the following decade, it struggled to deliver consistent profit, given limited room for maneuver under terms set by the European Union.\nThe transaction allows the government to immediately cut Italy\u2019s debt mountain by \u20ac920 million ($1 billion) and came just hours ahead of assessments by the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive, on national budgets for 2024.\nAn official briefed on the matter said a key condition for kicking off the sale was Italy\u2019s latest budget and its financial management. Representatives for UBS and Jefferies declined to comment.\nThe finance ministry offered a 20% stake on Monday evening, after the market close. Demand turned out to be five times the size of that offer, prompting the government to boost the stake to 25%, the people said. Italy sold 314.9 million shares for \u20ac2.92 a piece, with a 5% discount on Monday\u2019s closing price.\nFollowing Monday\u2019s sale, Italy has shrunk its stake in Paschi from 64% to 39%, which could pave the way for creating a third Italian banking group, as planned by Meloni. A smaller state holding could facilitate an M&A deal.\nThe EU allowed Italy to nationalize Paschi, based in Siena in Tuscany, in 2017 on condition it be re-privatized with an initial deadline set for 2021. Meloni\u2019s predecessor Mario Draghi asked the EU to extend a deadline to sell the state\u2019s controlling stake to the middle of 2024.\nA turnaround under Chief Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio, after years of restructuring, has turned the bank into an asset and not a burden.\nEarlier this month, Paschi shares hit their record high since a \u20ac2.5 billion capital increase completed a year ago. Shares closed at \u20ac3.17 on Nov. 16, marking an increase of about 60% compared to the offer price of \u20ac2. The share sale was part of Lovaglio\u2019s turnaround plan.\n(Updates with Jefferies no comment in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nBy Rae Wee\nSINGAPORE, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on Wednesday to hit its lowest against the yen in more than two months and languished near a three-month trough against its major peers, as expectations mount the Federal Reserve could begin lowering rates by early next year.\nThe Australian dollar held near a four-month peak while the New Zealand dollar scaled a roughly four-month top of $0.61495 in early Asia trade. Australian inflation data is due later in the day, followed by a rate decision from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).\nThe greenback tumbled to 147.02 yen and pushed the euro back above $1.10 to last trade at $1.10025, after Fed Governor Christopher Waller - a known hawkish and influential voice at the central bank - on Tuesday flagged a possible rate cut in the months ahead.\n\"He's relatively hawkish, historically speaking, so if his attitude is turning a little bit more dovish, it sort of says that perhaps a general consensus of the board members is that rates have peaked and maybe could even be cut next year,\" said Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com.\nMarket pricing currently shows a 40% chance the Fed could begin easing monetary policy as early as next March, as compared to a roughly 22% chance a day ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the greenback slid to a more than three-month low of 102.60. The dollar index was eyeing a nearly 4% loss for November, its worst monthly performance in a year.\n\"We have become less constructive on the prospects for the U.S. dollar, as progress in reducing U.S. inflation suggests the risks are tilted toward earlier rather than later Fed easing,\" said economists at Wells Fargo in a note. \"Despite U.S. economic resilience, this should lessen the greenback's near-term gains.\"\nSterling last bought $1.27105, hovering near the previous session's roughly three-month high of $1.2715.\nThe Aussie gained 0.1% to $0.6656, not far from Tuesday's four-month top of $0.6666, as traders turned their attention to an inflation reading due later on Wednesday for clues on whether more rate hikes from the Reserve Bank of Australia are in the offing.\n\"In principle, if that inflation number comes in a little bit hot again, probably doesn't say that we'll get a hike in December, but it certainly puts greater focus on the next inflation print at the start of next year to gauge whether the RBA would need to go again in perhaps February,\" said Capital.com's Rodda.\n(Reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

It has approximately 800 locations in the United States and Canada, and has this year added $380 million to Berkshire's profit through September.\nBuffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting in May he wished he could have bought all of Pilot in 2017, but the Haslams did not want to sell.\nBerkshire also owns dozens of other businesses including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurer, and big stakes in Apple, Bank of America and other stocks.\nThe case is Pilot Corp v Abel et al, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 2023-1068-MTZ.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

The rise of seemingly more capable conversational tools like ChatGPT, powered by so-called generative AI, have highlighted the shortcomings of Amazon\u2019s software. Teams at the company are racing to infuse Alexa with more of those capabilities.\nThe shares rose about 1% at 10:07 a.m. in New York.\nAmazon, which avoided mass job cuts for most of its existence, began its largest-ever layoffs about a year ago, ultimately axing 27,000 corporate positions after a hiring spree during the pandemic left the company with too many people. The company deepened the layoffs when it announced another 9,000 layoffs in March, which Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said would land on the cloud services division, human resources, advertising and the Twitch livestreaming service.\nSince then, the company has continued to look for cost cuts, at times leading to more layoffs. Amazon recently eliminated jobs in its music division and video games unit, and shuttered its physical clothing stores.\nRausch said employees in the US and Canada set to be laid off would be informed Friday morning Seattle time. Employees in India will find out next week, and cuts in other countries may follow other timelines to allow for consultations with employee groups or other factors.\nThe technology news site GeekWire reported the job cuts earlier.\n(Updated with context on Alexa\u2019s struggles, Amazon shares, beginning in the fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Elsewhere in Asia, Chinese banks maintained their benchmark rates as they aim to boost liquidity and support lending.\nHere are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy:\nEurope\nS&P Global\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index was in contraction again in November, hitting 47.1. While that\u2019s a bigger uptick than anticipated by economists, it marks the sixth consecutive month below the 50 level that marks expansion. Readings for both manufacturing and services showed a similar trend.\nGermany will suspend a constitutional limit on net new borrowing for a fourth consecutive year after Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s government was forced into a radical budget overhaul by a ruling last week from the nation\u2019s top court. The emergency move to lift the so-called \u201cdebt brake\u201d will be part of a revised 2023 budget that Finance Minister Christian Lindner plans to present next week.\nAsia\nChina may be done with rate cuts for now as policymakers turn to other means to support the economy and stabilize credit growth headed into the new year.\nSouth Korea\u2019s early trade data show exports are likely to maintain their growth momentum this month, continuing their rebound from a year-long slump and helping brighten the outlook for global commerce. Korea is a key global exporter, so its exports serve as a useful indicator of the health of the global economy.\nEmerging Markets\nThailand\u2019s economic growth unexpectedly slowed in the third quarter as manufacturing slumped on weak exports, supporting the case for the new government to proceed with its planned $14 billion cash handout program.\nChile\u2019s economy expanded more than forecast in the third quarter led by the mining sector, as the central bank started easing monetary policy. Gross domestic product rose 0.6% in the July-September period from a year earlier.\nIn what will be a marathon month for interest-rate decisions in Africa, its biggest economies are set to keep interest rates higher for longer. Angola and Zambia hiked this week to temper stubborn inflation and stabilize the local currency, and Nigeria is expected to hike as well. South Africa maintained its current rate, and others including Morocco, Kenya and Ghana are seen doing the same.\nUS\nAmericans are increasingly tapping their retirement savings to cover housing and medical bills amid higher cost-of-living pressures, according to data from Fidelity Investments. Some 2.3% of workers took a hardship withdrawal last quarter, up from 1.8% a year earlier.\nUS mortgage rates dropped sharply, capping the biggest four-week slide in nearly a year and spurring a fresh round of applications to purchase homes.\nWorld\nChina and Saudi Arabia have signed a local-currency swap agreement worth around $7 billion, deepening their ties as countries across the Middle East look to shift more of their non-oil trade away from the dollar.\nThe shock that rippled through global housing markets as central banks rapidly raised interest rates last year has given way to a cold new reality: The real estate bonanza that fueled wealth for millions of people is over.\nHungary\u2019s central bank cut its main interest in line with guidance, resisting government pressure for a bolder move in lowering the European Union\u2019s highest borrowing costs. Sri Lanka and Paraguay also cut. Turkey\u2019s central bank hiked interest rates by double the amount markets expected, while Sweden and Indonesia left rates unchanged.\n--With assistance from Fahad Abuljadayel, Ari Altstedter, Carolina Gonzalez, Prashant Gopal, Sam Kim, Kamil Kowalcze, John Liu, Yujing Liu, Michael Nienaber, Reade Pickert, Pathom Sangwongwanich, Zoe Schneeweiss, Alex Tanzi, Ainsley Thomson, Monique Vanek, Alexander Weber and Suttinee Yuvejwattana.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Some have turned to domestic chipmakers such as Huawei Technologies, in a trend analysts have called a threat to Nvidia's lead.\nReuters reported last week that Tencent rival Baidu has ordered 1,600 Huawei Ascend 910B chips.\nTencent has a stock of H800 AI chips that Nvidia developed specifically for China last year in response to earlier export curbs - but the new rules cover those too.\nIt said one way to best utilise its H800 chips is to reserve them for the most crucial part of AI model development, which is the training of the model.\n\"We'll try to see whether we can offload a lot of the inference capability to lower-performance chips so that we can retain the majority of our high-performance AI chips for training purposes,\" Lau said.\nNvidia plans to market new China-bound AI chips, with an announcement on Nov. 16 at the earliest, industry newsletter SemiAnalysis reported last week.\nThe chips are equipped with most of Nvidia's newest features for AI work but have reduced computing power to comply with the new rules, SemiAnalysis said.\nNvidia declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Jane Merriman and Christopher Cushing)",

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an unchanged reading of 48.7.\nSterling jumped against the dollar and the euro, while British government bond prices fell and markets pushed back bets on when the Bank of England will start to cut interest rates.\n\"Relief at the pause in interest rate hikes and a clear slowdown in headline measures of inflation are helping to support business activity, although the latest survey data merely suggests broadly flat UK GDP in the final quarter of 2023,\" Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence said.\nTotal new orders declined for the fifth month in a row, which S&P Global said reflected a persistently weak economy.\nThe PMI chimed with other measures of Britain's economy that indicate stagnating growth.\nBritain's economy has suffered from the highest inflation rate among big, rich countries and gross domestic product failed to grow in the third quarter. But the pace of price growth slowed more than expected to 4.6% in October.\nThe Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold at its last two meetings after 14 increases in row. But it has warned that inflation could be more persistent than expected, citing upside risks.\nGovernor Andrew Bailey this week suggested interest rates could remain higher for longer than priced by investors.\n\"Today\u2019s release will add to the Bank\u2019s unease about the stickiness of inflation,\" said Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics.\nWhile the PMI for the services sector was in positive territory at 50.5, the manufacturing sector came in at 46.7, a six-month high but still signalling a decline in output.\nA separate survey from the Confederation of British Industry published on Wednesday showed the biggest fall in factory orders since January 2021.\nS&P's survey respondents reported a slight uptick in already substantial input cost inflation, and noted \"strong\" wage growth which pushed up the average prices they charged.\nOverall, while firms were more upbeat about their prospects for the year ahead, forward-looking indicators showed recession risks were likely to remain elevated next year.\nEuro zone PMI released earlier on Thursday showed the region's downturn eased slightly in November, but suggested the bloc's economy was still likely to contract this quarter.

Price pressures continued easing across almost all categories and remained at a two-year low.\nA core measure that excludes volatile components including fuel and food moderated for a fourth month, to 3.6%.\nInflation is undershooting analyst expectations across the 20-nation euro area following the ECB\u2019s unprecedented ramp-up in interest rates. Output is waning as well, however: Gross domestic product shrank 0.1% in the third quarter, leaving the region teetering on the brink of a recession.\nFigures earlier Thursday showed those two trends playing out in France, prompting money markets to bring forward wagers on the ECB lowering borrowing costs. They now fully price a quarter-point cut by April, compared with June just over a month ago.\nMarkets are betting on four quarter-point reductions in 2024 \u2014 up from three last week \u2014 and are assigning a 70% chance of a fifth, which would bring the deposit rate back to 2.75% from a record 4% currently.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\u201cThe lower-than-expected reading on euro-area inflation should confirm for the ECB that price pressures are falling and that it can afford to not hike interest rates again.

Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said it\u2019s premature to even mention cuts.\nIndeed, inflation is likely to tick higher before returning to target due to statistical effects and the wind-down of measures deployed last year by governments to offset soaring energy prices.\nPresident Christine Lagarde has warned price gains may quicken \u201cslightly\u201d in the coming months and Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Nowcast for December points to a reading of 3.2%.\nThere are also question marks over how much of the rapid policy tightening \u2014 450 basis points of rate hikes in little over a year \u2014 is still to hit the economy.\nThe process is clearly visible in the financial sector, with lending to firms last month showing a first annual drop since 2015. A real estate boom underpinned by rock-bottom rates has also come to an end. Austria\u2019s Signa became a prominent casualty when the centerpiece of the sprawling property and retail group filed for insolvency this week.\nThe labor market has been holding up, however, with separate numbers Thursday showing euro-area joblessness staying at 6.5% in October.\nBut in his debut speech on monetary policy, Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta cautioned the ECB against needlessly harming the economy.\n\u201cDisinflation is well under way,\u201d he said in Rome. \u201cWe need to avoid unnecessary damage to economic activity and risks to financial stability, which would ultimately jeopardize price stability.\u201d\n--With assistance from Joel Rinneby, Barbara Sladkowska, Constantine Courcoulas, Andrej Sokol (Economist), Alessandra Migliaccio and Craig Stirling.\n(Updates with Bloomberg Economics.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

        "text": "\nIn 2022, Brazilian oil and gas company Petrobras had 68 places staked out for oil exploration off the South American coast, searching for new reserves while spending $6.9 billion in oil development projects. About the same time, Algeria-based Sonatrach proclaimed its ambition to ramp up production to become a top five national oil company by 2030. And Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. opened 68 new gas stations in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, noting in its 2022 annual report that there were now more than 500 across the UAE.\nAll these companies, along with 33 others focused on oil and gas, sent delegations to Egypt for last year's annual climate summit, known as COP27, aimed at moving the world away from the burning of fossil fuels like oil and gas. Many will likely be at the upcoming conference, COP28, being hosted in the UAE, which appointed Sultan al-Jaber, chairman of the nation\u2019s oil company, as president of the summit.\nFaced with criticism about their presence at negotiations, leaders of such companies argue they are part of the transition to renewable energies, an argument that negotiators like U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry have cautiously endorsed. But an Associated Press review of how much these companies invest in green energies, along with the priorities laid out in their annual reports, cast doubts on genuine commitments to transition.\nMost companies only have small, if any, investment in solar or wind power, the most established green technologies. Most of their investments, billions of dollars, are in further exploration, extraction and refining of oil \u2014 with plans laid out in some cases over the next decades. That's long beyond when scientists say the world must move away from fossil fuels.\n\u201cThese are companies with enormous profits at present, enormous engineering capabilities and have been producing oil and gas for a very long time,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cIt is reasonable to expect leadership in how quickly they lead and move and develop new technologies and drive the cost down\u201d of renewables.\nThe companies at last year's summit don't look to be making such efforts in any big way. Many that publish annual reports have sections entitled \u201csustainable\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d that do include some renewables. However, in such sections they also include biofuels, hydrogen development and carbon capture, all things that at best have long-term potential to reduce emissions. Many also tout natural gas which, while cleaner-burning than fuels like coal, still emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\nAlmost all the companies focus on reducing emissions in their operations, and don't address the emissions that will result when customers use their products to power cars, heat homes, move ships and planes, and so forth.\nThose emissions are known as \u201cScope 3\u201d and they are commonly seen as both the biggest share of a company\u2019s emissions and the most difficult to solve, with many companies arguing they are out of their control. (Scope 1 refers to a company\u2019s direct emissions, and Scope 2 are indirect emissions that come from production of the energy a company acquires to use in its operations.)\nAmir Sokolowski, global director of the Climate Change Team at CDP, a nonprofit that asks companies to disclose their climate impact, said fossil fuel companies are reluctant to take on emissions from their products after they\u2019re out the door.\nBut that reluctance isn't rational \"because the point is that oil and gas cause most of the combustion in the world in terms of emissions,\u201d Sokolowski said.\nPetrobras, majority-owned by the Brazilian government, specializes in deep water exploration, drilling and extraction. Its 2023-27 strategic plan earmarks $4.4 billion in investments \u201cto strengthen our low carbon position.\" Petrobras\u2019 planned investments in crude oil exploration and production for the period are more than 10 times higher than its low-carbon investments, according to the World Benchmarking Alliance, which tracks companies on sustainability goals.\nMeanwhile, the company's commitment toward those core products is clear. The scores of exploratory leases and billions invested in searching for new oil deposits fit a strategy that expects oil and gas production \u201cwill still be necessary to guarantee the energy security of Brazil and the world in the coming decades,\u201d the company says on its website.\nSixteen of the oil companies that went to last year\u2019s climate summit have publicly responded in recent years to questionnaires prepared by CDP, which invites companies and countries to be transparent about what they\u2019re doing on carbon and the climate. One question was how much of their spending was aimed at helping with the global goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times, which scientists warn is necessary to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, like increasing extreme weather events.\nEquinor, a Norway-based oil and gas company, answered in 2022 that 11% of its capital spending could be classified this way, with a goal of 30% by 2025. Notably, Equinor was also one of a minority of companies with a plan to tackle Scope 3 emissions -- those caused by consumers\u2019 use of its products \u2014 to get to net zero emissions by 2050.\nEquinor's plan includes a big focus on renewables. The company is building out the world's largest offshore wind farm, aimed at powering 6 million British homes one day. But the plan also depends on carbon capture and carbon offsets, or the equalizing of emissions by paying to capture them somewhere else. Equinor also says it will be necessary to continue to produce oil and gas \u201cfor the foreseeable future,\u201d in part to avoid global shocks.\nAl-Jaber\u2019s company, ADNOC, earlier this year began using drones to scatter mangrove seeds across Abu Dhabi, part of what it touted as a sustainability effort to plant some 2.5 million of the carbon-storing plants. Yet the company's investment in low-carbon projects amounts to just 10% of its reported plans for $150 billion in capital spending through 2027.\nADNOC, Petrobras, Equinor and Sonatrach declined or did not respond to interview requests to talk about their energy transition plans.\nSome companies in developing nations underscored the tension between the importance of oil and gas to their national economies and the industry's contribution to climate change, which can hit their countries harder than the developed world.\nUganda National Oil Co. in August announced formation of the Alliance for Climate Resilience to Combat Climate Change, an effort it said would include things like planting millions of trees, decarbonizing industry and shifting to cleaner cooking methods, with hopes to attract other East African nations to join.\nBut Uganda National was among companies whose plans for renewable energy were aimed primarily at using the clean power to decarbonize its fossil fuel projects, not replace them with cleaner pursuits.\nProscovia Nabbanja, the company's chief executive, referenced the difficult transition in an essay titled \u201cAdvancing Equitable Clean Energy in Developing Nations.\u201d Nabbanja noted pressure on nations like hers \u201cthat have not benefited from significant industrial and economic growth but are now expected to reduce emissions at the expense of their own development.\u201d She said wealthier nations have to lend money and technology to help developing nations with an \u201cequitable energy transition.\u201d\nPeter Muliisa, the company's general counsel, said that as a developing country, Uganda has low emissions relative to other nations. He also argued that it should be up to countries, not companies, to control Scope 3 emissions.\n\u201cIt is very hard for companies to plan for Scope 3 emissions, to put them in their plans,\u201d Muliisa told the AP.\nRegardless of who is responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas, in notes to investors some of the companies strike a reassuring tone about fossil fuels' durability. In its 2022 annual report, Chevron noted that while the future was uncertain, many outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant energy source while lower-carbon alternatives are incorporated.\n\u201cThe company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers' and consumers' demand,\u201d said the report.\n___\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

        "text": "\nBy Howard Schneider\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Banks tightened lending standards for U.S. businesses and households in the third quarter, but the pace of change appeared to ease, and demand for loans fell broadly in a sign of the impact higher interest rates are having on the economy, the Federal Reserve reported on Monday.\nThe tightening of standards for business loans applied to firms of all sizes, the U.S. central bank said in its latest survey of senior bank lending officers, while consumers faced tighter credit for home and home equity loans, credit cards, and tougher terms on auto loans.\nDemand for loans fell broadly, with 60% of banks citing moderately or substantially weaker demand for home mortgages in the third quarter, up significantly from 43% in the second quarter, as the Fed's aggressive rate increases since March of 2022 continued to bite on the residential housing industry.\nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate home mortgage rose sharply through the summer and fall, and at more than 7.7% has hit levels not seen in nearly a quarter of a century.\nThe detailed responses of the survey, fielded quarterly by the Fed and part of the data presented by staff to policymakers, did suggest, however, that the pace of credit tightening may be easing as the central bank's rate increases reach a likely plateau in the nearly 20-month-old tightening cycle.\nThe Fed has kept its policy rate steady in the 5.25%-5.50% range since July, and many analysts feel it is unlikely to go higher.\nWhile more than half of banks reported tightening business lending standards in the second quarter, just 35% said they cranked down further in the third quarter, with about 62% keeping standards the same. One bank reported easing standards slightly.\nAsked about the reasons for why standards may have shifted, bankers were also less likely in the third quarter to cite concerns about the overall economy or their own banks' financial position, and more likely to point to lower risk tolerance and the ability to resell loans in the secondary market.\nDemand for commercial and industrial loans weakened most among small firms, with more than half of banks saying credit demand had fallen among firms with annual sales of less than $50 million. About 39% of bank loan officers said loan demand had fallen among larger firms in the third quarter, compared to nearly 60% in the second quarter.\nFor households, 86% of loan officers said they had kept standards for home mortgages about the same in the third quarter, though 12% said standards had gotten tighter. Just over 5% of banks said they had tightened standards in the second quarter.\nAnalysts said the survey results were consistent with an expected economic slowdown in the final months of the year.\n\"The survey continued to show tightening lending standards and decreases in demand across the major reported loan types that look broadly consistent with an economy that should be slowing,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at J.P. Morgan.\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)",

        "text": "\nFlorida Realtor Alexandr\u00e9 Worthington is already bracing for a shift that threatens a tear down a compensation system that has ruled his industry for more than a century.\n\"It's the perfect time to pick up the pieces,\" Worthington said. \"It's a perfect time to reflect on the changes that could be coming and how to prepare for them.\"\nSubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.\nIn a federal civil case, a Kansas City jury last month found the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and major brokerages conspired to keep commissions artificially high. The result has left the real estate industry holding its collective breath, as experts say it is on the cusp of a radical reorganization that could affect everything about the business.\n\"There's a lot of speculation out there around how this will play out,\" said Ryan Tomasello, who covers the real estate technology sector for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Although much remains uncertain, \"we have a high degree of confidence that, at the conclusion of this storyline, significant changes will be made to the commission structure in the U.S.\"\nThe most immediate and striking blow could come as a result of the federal case in Kansas City, Mo. The judge overseeing the case has the power to issue an injunction that could break up the century-old \"bundled\" or \"cooperative\" commissions system, in which sellers' and buyers' agents split a commission that typically ranges between 5 and 6 percent of the home sale price. The timing of such an action remains unclear.\nA settlement in which NAR agrees to change the system is also possible, according to Michael Ketchmark, the lead plaintiff attorney. \"We're in the process of having conversations with the [Justice Department] and NAR, and we remain hopeful that we're going have a resolution that brings relief to millions across the county,\" he told The Washington Post.\nIn 2019, a group of home sellers sued NAR and brokerages Keller Williams and HomeServices of America in the Kansas City federal court, accusing the organizations of conspiring to keep commissions artificially high by requiring sellers to make the cooperative commission offer before listing homes on a widely used property database - the Multiple Listings Service - that allows for-sale properties to receive notice. The plaintiffs alleged that the system stifled competition and inflated commissions for buyers' agents.\nNAR, Keller Williams and HomeServices of America have denied those allegations and vowed to appeal the Oct. 31 verdict that awarded $1.8 billion to a half-million Missouri home sellers, an amount that could swell to $5 billion. Those organizations say the existing commissions structure is transparent, and they denied that the payment structure was anticompetitive. NAR said after the verdict that the \"matter is not close to being final.\"\nMantill Williams, an NAR spokesman, said the association is open to a resolution that \"maintains a way for buyers and sellers to continue to benefit from the cooperation of real estate professionals and eliminates our members' risk of liability for the claims alleged.\"\n\"That being said,\" he added, \"we remain confident we will prevail on our appeal.\"\nBut the verdict has already sent convulsions through financial markets and the real estate industry.\nShares of Zillow plunged nearly 7 percent after the jury rendered its verdict, as investors saw potential changes as a threat to the company's revenue model - a large portion of which comes from advertising for buyers agents, according to analysts. During an earnings call a day after the jury verdict, Zillow chief executive Richard N. Barton sought to reassure Wall Street analysts that buyers agents would not go extinct and that the company's revenue model was safe.\nHe added that possible developments to the commissions system \"look like good initial steps at more transparency and education for consumers,\" though added that he believed any change would come slowly.\nChanges to the commissions structure could eventually result in a 30 percent reduction in the $100 billion total that U.S. consumers pay in real estate commissions, according to a report by Tomasello and his team. Analysts and real estate experts said prices for buyers' agents would adjust more accurately to the value of their services. If buyers' agents are no longer guaranteed 3 percent of the commission, their fees might fall because they would have to compete on the price of their services, experts said.\nWorthington, the Florida Realtor, said buyers' agents could shift to an \"a la carte\" service model, in which potential home buyers choose their level of service and pay accordingly. A 1 percent commission, for example, could buy a customer automated emails with new homes for sale, based on the preferences of a prospective buyer, he said.\nFor a 3 percent commission, \"I'm actually going to walk into my office every morning and scrub our system and every resource I have to find the house that you're looking for,\" he said.\nSophia Gilbukh, an assistant professor of real estate at Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business in New York, said breaking up the buyers' and sellers' agent commissions could also result in lower listing prices for homes.\nHigh fees borne by sellers result in higher listing prices, Gilbukh said, because sellers want to cover their costs. Higher prices increase mortgage payments for buyers, she said.\nBreaking up the commission system, Gilbukh said, would result in lower prices overall but also lead to bigger upfront costs for buyers, who indirectly pay the costs of the commissions in the form of higher mortgage payments. Without the structure of the current cooperative system, buyers would need to directly pay their agents immediately after a sale.\n\"That might put a lot of buyers at a disadvantage, especially liquidity constrained buyers,\" she said. \"They might not be able to afford a higher-fee agent - even if it's worth it for them - because they just don't have the money to pay for it upfront.\"\nThe cooperative compensation structure was established in 1913, when National Association of Real Estate Exchanges, the precursor to NAR, said its member agents should share commissions with agents that produced buyers, according to a 2015 study by economists Panle Jia Barwick and Maisy Wong. The commissions rate hit 5 percent in 1940 and has remained virtually unchanged ever since, according to the study.\nCommissions work differently in countries such as the United Kingdom, where sellers pay typically less than 2 percent, and buyers pay their own agents, according to the study.\nU.S. regulators have long scrutinized America's commission system, Tomasello, the analyst, said. In 2020, the Justice Department sued NAR and proposed a settlement in which the association would have to change its rules to bring more transparency to its commission system. The settlement also sought to stop NAR from saying buyers' agent services are free. But less than a year later, the Justice Department withdrew from the settlement to \"permit a broader investigation of NAR's rules and conduct to proceed without restriction.\"\nThe Justice Department has also filed statements of interest in the Missouri case and a similar civil case in Illinois that clarify the parameters of a 2008 settlement between NAR and the Justice Department involving online listings. It did not respond to a request for comment on settlement negotiations in the Kansas City case.\nEchoing the Missouri and Illinois cases, a new group of Missouri residents filed a proposed lawsuit Oct. 31, alleging that real estate agents are conspiring to keep commissions high, restraining price competition and harming consumers in violation of federal antitrust laws. The lawsuit seeks damages for home sellers nationwide.\nCarole Higgins, a real estate agent in Suttons Bay, Mich., said changes are long overdue because agents have largely failed to appropriately explain contracts and commissions to consumers.\n\"We've grown so sloppy with the way that we are training our Realtors that this was the natural outcome,\" Higgins said of the lawsuits. This \"is a wake-up call.\"\nRelated Content\nPanda diplomacy to live on?

Its prediction for this year was in line with one issued by the government about a month ago, but next year's forecast was considerably gloomier than the 1.3% the government expects.\nIn their previous outlook in March, the experts had forecast that gross domestic product would grow 0.2% this year and 1.3% in 2024.\nThe panel's chair, Monika Schnitzer, said that \u201cthe economic recovery in Germany is delayed \u2014 it is ... still being slowed by the energy crisis and reduced real income caused by inflation.\u201d She noted that central banks' interest rate increases and economic weakness in China have made Germany's trading environment more difficult, while the high interest rates are dampening investment and construction at home.\nInflation in Germany has now fallen back to 3.8%, its lowest level since August 2021. People's real income should increase next year, leading to higher private spending and \u201ca cautious economic recovery,\u201d Schnitzer said.\nAs well as the current economic headwinds, Germany has been grappling with other issues such as an aging population, lagging use of digital technology in business and government, excessive red tape that holds back business launches and public construction projects, and a shortage of skilled labor.\nIn its annual report, the advisory panel suggested that the country's retirement age \u2014 which is currently being raised gradually to 67, a level it will reach in 2031 \u2014 be raised further in the future to take account of rising life expectancy.\nIt didn't offer specifics, but panel member Martin Werding pointed to a possibility of raising the retirement age by six months every 10 years so that it would reach 68 in mid-century.",

That addition freezes assets held in the United States and bars U.S. companies or citizens from trading with those listed, freezing them out of all dollar payments.\nSerdyukhov said the exchange's foreign intermediaries had demanded SPB carry out compliance.\n\"We were forced to suspend trading and now only settlements on transactions concluded before the sanctions were imposed are available to us,\" Serdyukhov said in a video message.\nThe bourse now has a queue of transactions from several days, but expects progress from Monday, said Serdyukhov.\nSPB is developing a process with international sanctions lawyers on how the shares will be delivered, the money transferred and in what currency. Details will be published in due course, said Serdyukhov.\nThe exchange last week said the sanctions would not affect clients' asset holdings, but Russia's central bank has warned that the SPB faces a serious challenge in finding long-term viability should foreign asset trading be diminished.\n\"We have always warned that owning foreign securities carries certain risks,\" Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said this week.\nShe estimated that about 80% of the volume of foreign shares was blocked.\nThe central bank is also assessing the readiness of Moscow Exchange, Russia's largest bourse, to deal with potential sanctions, Nabiullina said.

        "text": "\n(Updated at 15:00 EDT) By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields tumbled to three-week lows on Thursday as investors appeared more confident stepping into the market, continuing a rally from Wednesday on relief that the U.S. Treasury Department announced smaller-than-expected increases in longer-dated Treasury supply. Bonds have sold off in recent months on concerns about quickly growing bond supply after the Treasury surprised markets in late July with a higher-than-expected borrowing estimate. Investors have also repriced for the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates higher for longer as economic data remains strong. On Wednesday the Treasury said it would raise auction sizes for longer-dated debt by less than was expected and noted that it expects one more quarter of auction size increases to meet its financing needs. There\u2019s \u201cdefinitely a substantial rally now that we\u2019ve gotten on the other side of a bunch of key data points,\u201d said Zachary Griffiths, senior investment grade strategist at CreditSights in Charlotte. It seemed \u201cmore likely that the Treasury refunding would be the bigger driver of the move in yields this week, which I think is correct.\u201d The Fed also failed to deliver any hawkish surprises at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, which has given investors greater confidence to take advantage of higher Treasury yields. \u201cIt seems like the lower-than-expected supply, the Fed that\u2019s on pause for now, and the market is comfortable with hawkish signaling, but I think the press conference was more balanced - all of that on net is allowing Treasuries to rally after what\u2019s been a pretty wild move higher over the last three months or so,\u201d said Griffiths. Benchmark 10-year note yields were last down 12 basis points at 4.669% and earlier reached 4.626%, the lowest since Oct. 13. Thirty-year bond yields fell 15 basis points to 4.821% and got as low as 4.788%, the lowest since Oct. 16. They are on track for the biggest one-day yield move lower since March. Interest rate-sensitive two-year note yields were little changed on the day at 4.977% after earlier dropping to 4.914%, the lowest since Sept. 5. The inversion in the yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes deepened as far as minus 34 basis points, the most inverted since Oct. 18. \"The rally continues today as the market is jumping on the bandwagon and bullish momentum is seemingly taking hold,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities said in a note on Thursday, adding that the bank has entered a long 10-year note position in its model portfolio. This trade is based on expectations of a weaker payroll report on Friday and for data to weaken in the coming months, before a likely recession in the second quarter of 2024, he said. Meanwhile the Fed has likely ended its rate hikes, and it will be difficult for the market to price out all rate cuts, which should cap yield increases. The Treasury's smaller than expected increases in long-dated debt auctions also shows it is responsive to the market, which should help in the medium-term, TD said. Friday\u2019s employment report for October is expected to show that employers added 180,000 jobs during the month.

        "text": "\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A lighting technician is mowing lawns. A camera assistant is teaching guitar again. An actor has thought about shifting careers.\nFor more than a decade, work had been nonstop in Atlanta\u2019s booming film industry thanks to Georgia\u2019s extremely generous tax break. Dubbed the \u201cHollywood of the South,\u201d metro Atlanta became a ubiquitous backdrop for huge projects, including Marvel films and Netflix's \u201cStranger Things.\u201d\nAs soundstages sprouted up, the insatiable need for crews turned the city into a prime destination for both behind-the-scenes workers seeking to break into the entertainment industry and \"journeymen\" actors wanting a reprieve from the hustle of Los Angeles or New York. But work dried up last winter and has been at a near-standstill ever since the industry's writers went on strike in May and actors joined them in July.\nWriters reached a deal late last month, but with the actors strike still ongoing, countless Atlanta-based performers, as well as members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, are grappling for financial survival and with whether they\u2019ll even return to the industry.\nTHE CREW\n\u201cI wake up every morning and I\u2019m like, s\u2014-, I wish I could be on set right now,\u201d said Ed O'Hare, a 29-year-old set lighting technician who broke into the industry shortly after college by doing janitorial work at a local studio.\nO'Hare said he rose through the ranks thanks to his eagerness to learn the crafts, eventually discovering a passion for lighting. Fellow technicians quickly took him under their wing and helped him get hired on productions, including the Benicio Del Toro-led thriller \u201cReptile,\u201d despite his lack of experience: \u201cI've been told by multiple people that I couldn't have done that in L.A. or New York,\" he says.\nHaving now gone nearly five months without film work, O'Hare has been relying on a combination of savings, unemployment checks and odd jobs he's been doing for his grandmother's neighbors, including lawnmowing and pressure washing. It's been enough for him to scrape by, though he's also considering getting a bartender job like he had in college.\nIn the meantime, O'Hare has attended some classes hosted by IATSE, reuniting with industry colleagues as they brush up on technical skills and learn new ones, including soldering.\nThere's a recurring joke during the classes, O'Hare says. Whenever the instructor asks for questions, someone is always quick to respond with the key one: \u201cYeah, when are we going back to work?\u201d\nLike his union, which has held unity rallies, O'Hare said he supports the writers and actors for fighting for what they deserve. He hopes the actors will soon reach a deal, though a recent breakdown in negotiations had quelled some optimism. Even with a deal, O'Hare knows it could still be months before he's back on set.\nAlex Buhlig, 34, moved from Atlanta to LA in 2015 as an aspiring camera assistant. But all the calls he got kept coming from Georgia.\nBuhlig was back in Atlanta in less than a year, working primarily on commercial projects, independent movies and reality shows until 2017 when he joined IATSE \u2014 and was soon asked to work on the blockbuster \u201cGodzilla: King of the Monsters.\"\n\u201cA month prior to working on \u2018Godzilla,\u2019 I had been doing indie films whose entire budget was $10,000,\" Buhlig recalls, laughing. \u201cIt's a testament to how busy Atlanta was at the time.\u201d\nIn recent months, Buhlig, now a second camera assistant, has been relying on sporadic work commercial and music video work, but \u201cif the strike continues through next year, that's unsustainable.\u201d\n\u201cI've got to figure something else out,\u201d said Buhlig, who has also been piecing together hours as a guitar teacher, a job he's held in the past while \"trying to avoid doing the restaurant thing again.\u201d\nBuhlig says he recently had to pull some money from his pension since his bank account was running low but considers himself \u201cextremely fortunate\u201d since he has health care coverage and doesn't have a family depending on him.\nHe knows others are in tougher positions.\n\u201cThe strike will definitely push people out of the industry \u2014 it probably already has,\u201d Buhlig said. \"Because if you had just gotten started or you weren\u2019t working recently, I couldn\u2019t imagine going through something like this.\u201d\nTHE ACTORS\nDespite Atlanta's large role in the industry, the local chapter of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has only about 3,700 members \u2014 less than 3% of total membership.\nYet Atlanta's actors praise the sense of community and the relatively low cost of living \u2014 though affordability has taken a big hit in recent years.\n\u201cI have found more community here in the city of Atlanta (over the past five years) than I had in LA in 40,\u201d actor Ethan Embry told cheering rallygoers this summer.\nEmbry, who started as a child actor before starring in the teen rom-com \u201cCan't Hardly Wait\" and Netflix's \u201cGrace and Frankie,\u201d later told the AP: \u201cIt\u2019s not the same fight for survival that Los Angeles has. Everything in Los Angeles feels like a competition. Here, everything feels like you\u2019re in it together.\u201d\nBethany Anne Lind credits Atlanta's post-2008 filming boom with boosting her then-fledgling acting career, saying she likely got some small roles because studios didn't want to spend money to fly someone else out.\nBut now that she's more established, with a memorable supporting role in Netflix's \u201cOzark,\u201d Lind says it's been hard to land meatier parts. She feels Atlanta-based actors are frequently overlooked by casting agents who still focus on New York and Los Angeles talent pools.\nLind is a prominent speaker at local rallies, yet feels slightly envious of colleagues in Hollywood, who picket outside studios daily \u2014 Atlanta may have the second-most number of soundstages in the nation, yet picket lines are a rarity because studios are headquartered elsewhere.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very strange to see my friends in LA and New York getting out there, like sweating their faces off every day and not being able to be a part of that,\u201d Lind, who signed an open letter this week urging SAG-AFTRA not to accept \u201ca bad deal,\u201d says. \u201cThere would be something cathartic about being able to put my body into it that I think we do miss out on here.\u201d\nOver the summer, as she focused her energy on her children and vegetable garden, Lind began to contemplate whether she should shift careers.\n\u201cFor the first time in my almost 20-year career now, I\u2019m really trying to think about what else I can do that I could have some enjoyment from, but also just be a little bit more steady and then hopefully have the flexibility to act also,\u201d she told the AP then.\nYet by October, she was back onstage, having landed the lead role in a local production of the British play \u201c Home, I'm Darling.\u201d She isn't discounting potentially going back to school for something else \u2014 but doesn't know what that alternative would be.\nOnce the actors get a deal, Embry is optimistic that business will once again boom in Georgia's capital \u2014 though this time people will be \u201ctreated more fairly.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already made the investment in Atlanta,\" Embry said of the studios. \"They realize that Georgia has things that are special to Georgia. There\u2019s a reason they all come here, and it\u2019s not just the tax break. We have the talent, we have the scenery, we have all of the different landscapes that filmmakers are looking for.\u201d",

The nonprofit did not on Wednesday ask other manufacturers for the same commitment.\nIn March, Hershey Chief Financial Officer Steve Voskuil said his company was looking to reduce levels of lead and cadmium, saying the metals are elements in soil that can occur naturally in a chocolate product.\n\"We would love to eradicate it completely,\" Voskuil said.\nConsumer Reports said more than 75,000 consumers signed an earlier petition for Hershey to reduce heavy metals in its chocolate, and that it is now again petitioning the company.\nHershey referred a request for comment to the National Confectioners Association.\n\"Chocolate and cocoa are safe to eat and can be enjoyed as treats as they have been for centuries,\" said Christopher Gindlesperger, a spokesman for the trade group.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York Editing by Bill Berkrot and Helen Popper)",

That's nearly three times more than all acts against French Jews in 2022, the Interior Ministry says.\nIn a statement Thursday evening, France's Foreign Ministry pointed a finger of blame at Russia, saying a Russian network of bots whipped up controversy about the stars with thousands of posts on X, the platform previously known as Twitter. Bots are automated accounts programmed to mimic human users by generating messages or following users on social media, often for nefarious or malicious purposes.\n\u201cThis new operation of Russian digital interference against France testifies to the persistence of an opportunistic and irresponsible strategy aimed at exploiting international crises to sow confusion and create tensions in the public debate in France and in Europe,\u201d the statement said.\nIt said the bots were affiliated with a Russian network \u2014 Recent Reliable News, also identified as Doppelg\u00e4nger.\nThe Russian activity was detected by Viginum, a French state digital watchdog set up in 2021 after hackers targeted Emmanuel Macron 's successful campaign for the French presidency in 2017. The core mission of Viginum is to detect and analyze foreign digital efforts to influence online public debate in France.\nViginum determined that a network of 1,095 bots affiliated with RRN published 2,589 posts on X in under two weeks, \u201ccontributing to the controversy surrounding the stenciled Stars of David,\u201d the French Foreign Ministry said.\nViginum also found that the RRN network appeared to have been informed about the graffiti before other posters on X, the ministry said. It said RRN bots first posted about the stars on the evening of Oct. 28 \u2014 48 hours before other photos of the stars started to appear on X.\nThe European Union has identified RRN as a digital information manipulation campaign that has also disseminated propaganda in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nAs well as using fake accounts on social media, RRN has also employed fake web pages that mimic media outlets and government websites, and \u201cis part of a broader hybrid campaign by Russia against the EU and the member states,\u201d the Council of the EU said in a July announcement of sanctions against Russian individuals and entities deemed responsible for the campaign.\n___\nAP journalists John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.",

A handheld device that connects to the PS5 over WiFi launches next week.\nIndustry observers were surprised by the recent announcement that gaming chief Jim Ryan will step down next March with developer Bungie cutting staff amid widespread industry layoffs.\nThe Oct. 20 release of \"Marvel's Spider-Man 2\" offers cheer going into the key year-end shopping season, with five million units of the game sold at the end of that month, Sony said.\nRival Nintendo has scored a string of hits in recent months as the company continues to draw in gamers despite eschewing the cutting edge graphics Sony and Xbox maker Microsoft have pursued. Sony hiked its full-year sales forecast for the games unit by almost 5% to 190 billion yen and maintained its profit forecast.\nIn the second quarter profit was supported by higher sales of third-party games but impacted by an increase in hardware losses.\nSony's movie division will co-finance and distribute a live action adaption of Nintendo's iconic \"Zelda\" franchise, leading to analysts raising the possibility of further collaboration between two leading Japanese entertainment companies.\n\"Sony's strong distribution network and publishing track record could make it a strategic move for Nintendo,\" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note ahead of Sony's earnings.\nThe company maintained its full-year operating profit view at 1.17 trillion yen but raised its sales and net income forecast by 2% each.\nSony shares ended down 0.8% on Thursday ahead of the earnings report. They have climbed 32% so far this year. ($1 = 151.0600 yen) (Reporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Kim Coghill)",

The agency declined to name the other platforms that would be covered beyond GooglePay, ApplePay, PayPal and CashApp.\nApple, PayPal and CashApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment.\nThe proposal marks a long-anticipated and ambitious move by CFPB Director Rohit Chopra to assert the agency's full authority over Big Tech, a sector he has frequently criticized for privacy and competition issues.\nSince becoming director in 2021, Chopra has steadily increased CFPB scrutiny of the sector, seeking information in 2021 on how Big Tech companies use consumer data and last year launching an inquiry into their payments platforms.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Chopra said the tech sector had expanded into financial services traditionally provided by the closely regulated banking sector.\n\"Today's rule would crack down on one avenue for regulatory arbitrage by ensuring large technology firms and other nonbank payments companies are subjected to appropriate oversight,\" he said.\nIn a speech last month, Chopra said CFPB research had found tech giants collected vast amounts of consumer payments data with few limits, scant transparency and confusing corporate policies, putting consumers at risk of Chinese-style surveillance by the companies.\nSpeaking about Tuesday's proposal, senior CFPB officials said it was imperative to look into privacy compliance at these larger firms with a wealth of consumer data, noting that many of their business models focus on monetizing that data.\nRepresentatives of Big Tech companies have previously highlighted their efforts to protect consumer data.\nTuesday's proposal would apply to companies handling more than five million transactions a year. The agency said the rule would also foster competition by ensuring that both traditional financial players and the tech sector were equally subject to the same oversight.\nIn a statement, the Consumer Bankers Association called the proposal \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\"For a healthy, innovative, and competitive financial services ecosystem to function, consumers need to know that they are protected equally, regardless of who they do business with to meet their financial needs,\" said CBA President and CEO Lindsey Johnson.\nThe Electronic Transactions Association, representing banks, fintechs and big tech companies, said in a statement it wants \"to ensure the proposal achieves the goals of consumer protection and consistent application of public policy for all players.\"\nThe proposal is now subject to a notice-and-comment period expected to end in early 2024.\n(Reporting by Douglas Gillison and Hannah Lang in Washington; Additional reporting by Chris Prentice in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Mark Potter and David Gregorio)",

        "text": "\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The OPEC oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia and allied producers including Russia made another big swipe at propping up lagging crude prices Thursday, expanding some output cuts into next year and bringing up-and-coming oil supplier Brazil into the fold.\nLower oil prices have been a good thing for U.S. drivers, who have been able to fill their gas tanks for less money in recent months. But it\u2019s bad news for OPEC+ countries whose oil income bolsters their economies and who have faced setbacks in pushing prices higher despite initial fears that the Israel-Hamas war could affect oil flows.\nThe OPEC+ oil ministers came out of an online meeting with more than 2 million barrels per day in voluntary cuts through the first three months of next year and declared that Brazil would join the bloc in January, bringing one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing oil producers into an alliance that is trying to rein in global supply.\nHowever, sweeping cutbacks from OPEC+ and individual member countries since October 2022 have not made lasting changes to oil prices because of concerns about too much crude circulating in a weakening global economy, which could weigh on the thirst for oil for travel and industry.\nThe market even shrugged off the new move, though it amounts to roughly 2% of global supply.\nJorge Leon, senior vice president of oil market research for Rystad Energy, called it a \u201cbit of disappointing meeting\u201d for OPEC+ and a \u201cbittersweet\u201d one for Saudi Arabia in particular because it couldn't convince the whole group to commit to production cuts.\nThe market also was let down, because it \u201cwas likely expecting a deal covering the first half of next year,\" he said.\nOther energy experts saw the oil bloc's two-part solution for a lagging market more positively. Paul Tossetti, an executive director of S&P Global Commodity Insights, praised the \u201cimaginative ways\u201d of OPEC+ lately in dealing with market challenges from the Americas, climate change efforts and on other fronts.\nTaken together, the bloc's two moves Thursday serve to \u201cpreserve the unity of the group at a challenging time,\u201d Bhushan Bahree, another executive director at the group, wrote.\nSaudi Arabia led the deepening voluntary cuts Thursday, extending its reduction of 1 million barrels per day through March. It was followed by Russia, which is cutting 500,000 barrels per day of crude and refined oil products, and then Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman with smaller amounts.\nRussia wants higher oil prices to boost the main way it fills its war chest against Ukraine, while the Saudis have to earn nearly $86 per barrel to meet their planned spending goals, according to the latest estimate from the International Monetary Fund.\nSaudi Arabia is trying to fund an ambitious overhaul of the kingdom\u2019s economy, reduce its dependence on oil and create jobs for a young population.\nBut the international benchmark Brent crude has stayed in the low- to mid-$80 range in recent weeks and fell more than 2% to $80.91 a barrel following the meeting before settling at $82.83 Thursday. U.S. crude also dropped 2.5% to $75.90 before settling at $75.96 per barrel.\nThe expanded cuts were expected to keep crude prices in the same range of $80 to $85 a barrel for the first half of the year, Leon said.\nLower oil prices have allowed U.S. gas prices to fall or stay steady since Sept. 19, AAA said. Gas is averaging just below $3.25 a gallon, the motor club said, down about 7% from a month ago.\nBut that's still higher than when President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, when prices were averaging about $2.40 a gallon. High inflation has been a political challenge for Biden going into the 2024 election, prompting him to say this week that efforts to improve supply chains and reduce price pressures are a priority.\n\u201cPresident Biden is focused on prices for American consumers, which have been coming down steadily,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday after the OPEC+ meeting.\nU.S. oil production has hit records as OPEC+ has cut back, with producers outside the group expected to keep leading global growth in oil supply next year, the International Energy Agency said.\nFor instance, daily production in the U.S. averaged 13 million barrels a day in August, an increase of more than 1 million barrels from a year ago, according to the latest monthly figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nThe risk is growing that production cuts could reduce the influence of OPEC+ over oil supplies as other countries boost their output.\n\u201cThe kingdom is balancing the desire to keep prices high by limiting supply with the knowledge that doing so will lead to a further drop in overall market share,\u201d Leon said.\nBringing in Brazil, which the IEA also said has been producing record amounts of oil this year, would give the 23-member OPEC+ a leg up.\nAdding Brazil's oil would bring the amount of global production controlled by OPEC+ up to 62%, similar to the share held by the organization when Russia joined in the mid-2010s, Leon said.\nJos\u00e9 Chrispiniano, press secretary for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, said the invitation was under analysis.\n___\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.

Unlike her siblings and father, she is not a defendant in the case.\nThe lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, accuses Trump and his family businesses of manipulating real estate asset values to dupe lenders and insurers and embellish Trump's reputation as a successful businessman.\nJudge Arthur Engoron has already ruled that the conduct amounts to fraud and is now considering what penalties to impose.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and accused James and Engoron of political bias and \u201celection interference.\u201d\nDuring defiant and rambling testimony on Monday, Trump acknowledged that valuations for his properties were not always accurate but said the errors were not relevant to the financial institutions that used them to price deals.\nHis sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump testified last week that the financial documents at the heart of the case were not their responsibility, though emails and other documents showed they may have been more involved than their testimony indicated.\nIvanka Trump was originally a defendant until a state appeals court dismissed her from the case in June, saying she was not involved in any conduct over which James could sue.\nUnlike her brothers, she did not oversee the Trump Organization during their father's 2017-2021 term in the White House.\nIn a ruling that found Trump, his adult sons and 10 of his companies liable for fraud, Engoron described in scathing terms how the defendants made up valuations. His ruling could strip Trump's control of some of his best known properties, though that order is on hold during appeal.\nJames is seeking $250 million in fines, as well as restrictions that would prevent Trump and his adult sons from doing business in their home state.\nIn addition to this case, Trump is a defendant in four separate criminal cases, including two about his attempts to overturn Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.\nNevertheless, opinion polls show he holds a commanding lead over Republican rivals to face Biden next year.

        "text": "\nBy Ben Klayman\n(Reuters) - High interest rates are derailing the ambitions of climate regulators and automakers to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles, underscored Wednesday by the scrapping of a GM-Honda partnership and a warning from a battery maker.\nElectric vehicle sales are still growing strongly, but that demand is not keeping up with the expectations of carmakers and other companies that have invested billions of dollars in the EV space. Expectations for persistently higher interest rates has led companies to alter plans as they eye 2024 warily.\n\"EV demand next year could be lower than expectations,\" Lee Chang-sil, chief financial officer at South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution said on Wednesday, due to global economic uncertainty.\nAlso on Wednesday, Honda and General Motors announced they were ending a $5 billion plan to develop lower-cost EVs together just a year after announcing the effort. GM on Tuesday said it would focus near-term EV efforts on meeting demand rather than hitting specific volume targets.\n\"We're taking immediate steps to enhance the profitability of our EV portfolio and adjust to slowing near-term growth,\" GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts.\nInvestors have responded to the changed outlook. Over the last three months, the iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech exchange-traded fund has plunged more than 24%, far more than the 8.3% fall for the MSCI All-World Index, a proxy for global equities.\nEV sales are growing, however. They topped 300,000 units in the United States for the first time in the third quarter, according to a Cox Automotive report. They rose 14.3% in September in the European Union and 22% in China, the world's largest EV market.\nFALLING RAW MATERIAL PRICES\nTesla CEO Elon Musk raised the alarm last week in explaining why he was slowing plans for a Mexico factory.\n\"I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we're in,\" he said on Tesla's earnings conference call. \"As I just can't emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder for people to buy the car.\"\nOther automakers have sounded similar notes of caution.\nGermany's Volkswagen last week cut its profit margin outlook for the year, blaming negative effects for raw material hedges at the end of the third quarter. Some of those materials are used in EV batteries.\nLike many other industrial firms, carmakers hedge against commodity price swings, and with EV demand slowing, raw material prices have softened, including those used heavily in batteries.\nLithium prices have tumbled 67% so far this year based on spot lithium carbonate prices assessed by Fastmarkets. Prices of cobalt metal on the CME have slid 20% this year and more than halved since May last year.\nU.S. automaker Ford earlier this month said it would temporarily cut one of three shifts at the plant that builds its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, and in July slowed its EV ramp-up, shifting investment to commercial vehicles and hybrids.\nShares of Japan's Nidec logged their biggest decline in a decade and a half on Tuesday, tumbling more than 10% on investor concerns over the motor manufacturer's prospects in an increasingly tough Chinese market for EVs.\nThe Japanese motor manufacturer now expects a 15 billion yen ($100 million) full-year loss at its key e-axle business, rather than the profit it had previously seen. E-axle manufacture combines motors, gears and power-control electronics.\nChina's CATL, the world's largest battery maker for EVs, said last week that third-quarter profit rose 10.7%, its weakest quarter since the start of last year due to slowing demand and stiff competition.\nThe company's market share in China tumbled in September to the lowest in more than a year, data showed, underscoring the challenges it faces from smaller rivals and weakening demand.\n(Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit and David Gaffen in New York; additional reporting by Eric Onstad in London and Victoria Waldersee in Berlin; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

We have been actively engaging with the committee on how we can best contribute to this important industry discussion.\"\"\nWifredo Fernandez, the head of U.S. and Canada government affairs at X, said in a statement that the company has been working \u201cin good faith\u201d to participate because safety is the company's top priority. \"Today we are communicating our updated availability to participate in a hearing on this important issue,\u201d Fernandez said.\nDurbin and Graham said the committee remains in discussions with both Meta and TikTok and expects their CEOs, Mark Zuckerberg and Shou Zi Chew, to testify voluntarily.\nSocial media companies have faced criticism from lawmakers, regulators and the public for harms their platforms cause to children and teenagers. Most recently, Meta was sued by 41 states and Washington, D.C. for contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict teenagers to the platforms.\n___\nOrtutay reported from San Francisco.",

That's how we clear up misperceptions and avoid surprises.\"\nSullivan said Biden would go into the summit \"on a solid footing,\" having positioned the United States to be able to compete effectively at home and abroad and with \"the strongest recovery and lowest inflation of any leading economy.\"\nHe said Washington is looking for specific outcomes from the meeting and hoped to see progress in reestablishing military-to military ties with China and in combating the trade in fentanyl that has become a scourge in the United States.\nChina cut off military-to-military communications with the United States last year after a visit to Taiwan, a democratically governed island China claims as its own, by then U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi. Tense relations soured further when the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon in February.\nSullivan said communication between the militaries was the way to ensure competition did not veer into conflict and that China had been \"constructive\" on the issue in dialogue leading up to the summit.\n\"We will see what happens in San Francisco and the President will be able to report after the meeting, whether in fact, we've made progress on restoring military-to-military links,\" he said.\nBiden and Xi have known each other for more than a decade and have shared hours of conversation over six interactions since Biden's 2021 inauguration.\nHowever, they have met only once in person since then and Xi has not visited the United States since 2017. Analysts and officials say they will come to the table in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and garbled impressions of what the other is seeking.\nThe meeting is also expected to cover global issues from the Israel-Hamas war to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, North Korea's ties with Russia, Taiwan, human rights, artificial intelligence, as well as \"fair\" trade and economic relations, senior Biden administration officials said.\nSullivan said Biden would raise stability across the Middle East, adding that Beijing should share an interest in de-escalation there.\nBiden would make the point that Iran acting in an \"escalatory, destabilizing way\" was not in the interests of China, he said. \"And the PRC, of course, has a relationship with Iran, and it's capable, if it chooses, to of making those points directly to the Iranian government.\"\nLeaders from the 21-member APEC forum are due to gather in San Francisco from Wednesday until Friday and the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine have divided opinion among them.\nThe senior U.S. official for APEC, Matt Murray, told reporters on Monday that the U.S. was working hard to try to get a strong consensus statement from the leaders, but analysts say the divisions make drafting this difficult.\nSullivan said that at APEC Biden would put forward his economic vision for the region and speak about \"how the United States is the preeminent driver of inclusive, sustainable economic growth in the Asia Pacific.\" (Reporting by Steve Holland, Nandita Bose in Washington; Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Alistair Bell)",

        "date": "2023-10-30T19:54:46.000Z",
        "text": "\nBy Stephen Nellis\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple on Monday introduced new MacBook Pro and iMac computers and three new chips to power them, with the company saying it had redesigned its graphics processing units (GPU), a key part of the chip where Nvidia dominates the market.\nThe new computers and the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips were unveiled at an online event heavily focused on professional users.\nIn the U.S., the 14-inch MacBook Pro laptop will start at $1,599 and a 16-inch version starts at $2,499. The new iMac desktop with the M3 family of chips starts at $1,299. Some will be available next week, while others will not ship until later in November.\nApple has seen a revitalization in its Mac business, roughly doubling its market share to nearly 11% since 2020 when it parted ways with Intel and started using its own custom-designed chips as the brains of the machines, according to preliminary data from IDC.\nAs part of the focus on business users on Monday, it showed off a new secure screen sharing feature that would let them on their machines from remote locations.\nThe company's custom chips, which use design technology from Arm Holdings, have given its Macs better battery life and, for some tasks, better performance than machines using Microsoft's Windows operating system.\nUnlike other laptop makers that might combine a central processor unit (CPU) from Intel with a GPU from Nvidia, Apple has combined both parts in its Apple silicon chips, which the company claims gives it better performance than its rivals.\nApple's shakeup of the market has spurred Qualcomm to redouble its efforts to make Arm-based chips for Windows, announcing plans last week to release a chip that is both faster and more energy efficient than some Apple offerings. Reuters last week reported that Nvidia also plans to jump into the PC market as early as 2025.\nCORPORATE BUYING\nApple aimed the new machines squarely at designers, musicians and software developers, at one point highlighting that the way it users memory can be used by artificial intelligence researchers, whose chatbots and other creations are often constrained by how much data can be held in the computer's memory.\nApple also tweaked its overall lineup of computers in ways that could change the behavior of corporate buyers.\nWhile slashing the U.S. price of the new 14-inch MacBook Pro from $1,999 to $1,599, Apple appeared to have eliminated a cheaper $1,299 13-inch model of its MacBook Pro that was a big seller to businesses, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst at Creative Strategies.\nThat move will likely clarify the choice between the company's model lines, prompting choices between Apple's productivity-oriented MacBook Air models that top out at $1,299 or the new $1,599 starting price for MacBook Pro models.\nAt Apple, the Mac hit $40.18 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2022, or about 11% of its revenue. While that was up 14% from the previous fiscal year, sales this year have slowed along with the rest of the PC industry, which has suffered a post-pandemic slump.\nApple said the new chips would be the first for laptops and desktops that use 3 nanometer manufacturing technology, which will give the chips better performance for each watt of electricity used.\nApple did not name who is making the chips, but analysts believe it is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which uses the same technology to make chips for the top-end iPhone 15 models.\nThroughout the event, Apple executives compared the performance of the new MacBooks and iMac machines to older Apple machines with chips from Intel, playing up how much speed customers would notice by upgrading to devices with Apple's own chips.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Shivani Tanna and Jahnavi Nidumolu in Bengaluru and Peter Henderson and Sayantani Ghosh in San Francisco; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Jamie Freed)",

        "text": "\nOne of Jack Kellogg's main indicators is the volume-weighted average price (VWAP).\nThis shows the average price paid for shares and helps him gauge sentiment.\nHe only uses indicators as a rough guide but never trades solely on them, he noted.\nJack Kellogg began trading stocks right out of high school in 2017.\nFive years into his craft, he has already been exposed to various types of market conditions, including the stock market crash of 2020, the raging bull rallies of 2021, and the bear market of 2022. One thing he has learned through it all is to keep things simple and remain flexible.\n\"There's this acronym: KISS, keep it simple stupid. I don't think people need super fancy indicators to make money trading. I'm just using basic trend lines, support, resistance, volume, and those are all my indicators,\" Kellogg said. \"I think if you overcomplicate the indicators, it will actually throw off your trading because then you're trading more on the indicators than the actual price action.\"\nThis attitude has allowed him to become a versatile trader who takes both long and short positions when appropriate, which helped him to continue trading throughout the bear market of 2022. His tax returns, viewed by Insider, showed that he reported over $8 million in gains from day trading in 2020 and 2021. His returns gained momentum in 2020 when he had a total income of $1.6 million. In 2021, that amount grew to a total income of $6.5 million.\nKellogg has come a long way since starting off with $7,500 which is what he initially deposited when he started trading. His road to success wasn't a straight line. When he first attempted to trade, he was down a few hundred dollars. This led him to realize that he didn't know what he was doing.\nSo his next moves included switching off real trading and testing his skills through paper trading. Then, he signed up for an online course his parents helped pay for. The program, which was created by Timothy Sykes, a trading teacher and former penny-stock trader known for claiming to flip his bar mitzvah cash gift into over $1 million in gains, helped him develop the skills and patience he then used to craft his skill.\nBy the time the stock market began to rally hard in 2020, he was ready to ride the upwards wave. In 2022, when the market slowed, he continued to reel in profits by betting on popular stocks like Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) and AMC (AMC), the latter of which banked him $60,000, according to a screenshot of his E-Trade brokerage account. He also traded a few small-cap stocks and saw large wins on single trades like Intelligent Living Application Group Inc. (ILAG) which earned him over $91,000, according to screenshots of his Guardian account.\nThe first indicator he uses as a sentiment guide is the volume-weighted average price (VWAP), which shows the average price paid for shares through all trading adjusted for volume. He uses it on the daily chart as a guide to determine a good buy-in price for the stock he's trading. This keeps him from being a chaser, the term popularly used for those who enter a position too late or after a stock begins to rally.\nIf the goal is to buy low and sell high, you don't want to pay more than what the average buyer paid, he noted. Therefore, Kellogg won't enter a position if the price is above the VWAP line. The opposite is true if he's shorting a stock: if the price is beneath the VWAP, he generally won't short the stock.\nOftentimes, he'll use this indicator to also determine when to exit his position because that point can sometimes indicate where a stock's price will begin to drop off. The same is also true in reverse: he'll sometimes use the VWAP to determine the price point where he'll cover his position. Therefore, if he shorted a stock at $9 and the VWAP is at $7.50, he'll use that price as a point to lock in profits.\nFor example, on January 5, he took a short position on ticker AMTD at $2.50. VWAP's center line was trending at around $2.22. So Kellogg covered his position at $2.25 and made a 10% profit.\nThe next indicator is linear regression, which shows the direction price is trending and when it may change its direction. They are three lines that overlay the candles. The lower and upper lines are the ranges of price movements or volatility, while the center line indicates the average between the two. Price action above the top line signals an overbought stock, and below the bottom line, an oversold stock.\n\"So the better a stock is respecting the lines of the channel that's created, the more predictable I think the stock's going to be,\" Kellogg said. This gives him a better sense that the stock's price action will trend according to his thesis.\nThe next indicator is volume which shows the number of shares being traded at any moment in time. Kellogg mainly uses volume as a potential indicator that a stock may reverse.\n\"Seeing big volume go through, I know that potentially a lot of people are on the wrong side. So if a big volume spike goes through near the high of the day, it's possible that a lot of people are buying the stock and a lot of people are chasing,\" Kellogg said.\nFinally, he keeps his eye on the support and resistance lines, the former being where the price tends to hold and the latter where it tends to sell off. The levels change throughout the day. Kellogg tries to find the key levels by looking for a parallel increase in volume in those areas. He also pays attention to how many times and for how long a price level holds to determine how strong that point is. While it's not an exact science, general areas where the price hoovers for 30 minutes to an hour are the strongest, he said.\n\"Eventually, you'll see a bouncing ball-type price action if the stock is going to go lower,\" Kellogg said. \"So you see it bounce from $7 to $8, then bounce again from $7.30 to $7.50, and then bounce from $7.40 to $7.10, then bounce from $7.20 and eventually cracks the support below $7. And then the question is, is it going to create a resistance level at $7 and continue to head lower?\"\nAt the end of the day, price action is king, Kellogg noted. Even if you have a thesis about why a stock's price can move in a certain direction, if the price is moving differently, you need to cut losses.\n\"I don't ever just base my entire decision off an indicator. So if an indicator isn't agreeing with the trade thesis, then I simply will cut my losses,\" Kellogg said. \"So I've never ever blamed any of my losses ever on an indicator because I don't let it get to that point. If the price action is continuing down, then I will cut my losses or if the price action is continuing up, then I'll cover my short positioning.\"\nEveryone has access and can view the same data \u2014 it's really about what you do with that data, he said. Where most traders struggle is with the psychology of trading. You can have the best strategy and indicators, but if you don't have the discipline to stick to it, then you will constantly find yourself in a bad situation. Most people don't put in enough effort to master their emotions, he said.\nThis story was originally published in March 2023.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

They said the government didn\u2019t adequately consider options to meaningfully constrain the project\u2019s oil production \u2014 and therefore its resulting carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 even as it ignored the greenhouse gas releases that could be unleashed from future developments that could be facilitated by Willow.\nSome of the project\u2019s challengers also took aim at the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s determination that Willow wouldn\u2019t harm polar bears that have dens in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska; the opponents argued instead that industrial oil operations pose a multi-faceted threat to the animals.\nGleason brushed aside those assertions Thursday, saying the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s decisions \u2014 including its conclusion that Willow-related work was unlikely to injure non-denning polar bears \u2014 were \u201creasoned\u201d and within the bounds of law. Environmental groups failed to prove the agency disregarded better available scientific evidence about the impacts of greenhouse-gas emissions from the project, Gleason said.\nErec Isaacson, president of ConocoPhillips Alaska, celebrated the ruling, saying it \u201cconfirms our confidence\u201d the government review complied with all legal requirements.\n\u201cWillow underwent nearly five years of rigorous regulatory review and environmental analysis, including extensive public involvement from the communities closest to the project site,\u201d Isaacson said in a statement. \u201cWe now want to make this project a reality and help Alaskan communities realize the extensive benefits of responsible energy development.\u201d\nErik Grafe, deputy managing attorney of the Alaska office for Earthjustice, which represented the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife and other organizations, called the ruling \u201cdisappointing\u201d and said the challengers planned to appeal.\n\u201cBeyond the illegality of Willow\u2019s approval, Interior\u2019s decision to greenlight the project in the first place moved us in the opposite direction of our national climate goals in the face of the worsening climate crisis,\u201d Grafe said.\nSiqi\u00f1iq Maupin, executive director of Sovereign Inupiat for a Living Arctic, said the ruling shows \u201cthe oil and gas industry exerts incredible power over those whose health and food are most impacted and who will most experience the climate harm and disaster this project will flame.\u201d\nThe project\u2019s backers have argued the government\u2019s review was expansive. They also emphasized that crude extracted from the site inside the 23 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska would be produced under more stringent environmental protections than elsewhere in the world, helping to bolster US energy security and provide an alternative to supplies from Russia.\n--With assistance from Andrew Janes.\n(Updates with ConocoPhillips comment in 8th and 9th paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

The New York-based firm also sold its holding in Rivian Automotive Inc., while adding more than $100 million worth of shares in UK biotech Abcam Plc.\nDruckenmiller and Soros, 93, have net worths of $9.9 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nMoney managers overseeing more than $100 million in US equities have to file a 13F form within 45 days of the end of each quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on US exchanges. It offers one of the few glimpses into how hedge funds and some large family offices invest.\nSome family offices, such as that of hedge fund billionaire David Tepper, added to their AI bets by buying more Nvidia stock in the quarter.\nOther highlights from 13F filings include:\nTPG Inc. co-founder David Bonderman\u2019s Wildcat Capital exited its $7.7 million position in Uber Technologies Inc. and accumulated a roughly $19 million holding in US online delivery firm DoorDash Inc.\nHedge fund billionaire Michael Platt\u2019s BlueCrest Capital Management invested about $106 million into iShares China Large-Cap ETF, a US-based exchanged-traded fund tracking big Chinese firms.\nWIT, an investment firm that manages part of the Walton family\u2019s fortune, similarly allocated more capital to a Vanguard ETF that tracks businesses worldwide based outside the US.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\nNo One Told AI Startups That San Francisco Is Over\nTexas Battles Wall Street in Threat to State\u2019s Muni Market\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

He wants to offer AI talent, products and services to corporate customers, emulating the business model of outsourcing providers like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd., the people said, asking to not be named as the effort isn\u2019t yet public.\nThe startup\u2019s main operations will be in Bengaluru, and it\u2019s headquartered in Singapore, where it\u2019s in stealth mode for now and will launch its offerings within months, the people said. It also plans to expand to the US, one of the people said.\nCompanies the world over are looking to harness AI, encouraged by new tools such as the ChatGPT chatbot from Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI Inc.

The startup also plans to offer services in the fields of financial services and data science and analytics. It aims to roll out products and services and begin marketing in the second half of 2024.\nBansal, 40, declined to comment.\nThe billionaire moved to Singapore after selling his Bengaluru-based internet company and now shuttles between the cities.

They established Flipkart as a more localized online retailer for India, inspired by Amazon, nearly six years before the Seattle giant entered the country\u2019s retail market. Binny went on to become the chief operating officer of Flipkart, and then its chief executive officer, before selling a majority stake in the company to Walmart in 2018 for $16 billion.\nBinny gradually sold his entire stake in Flipkart to Walmart, and began investing in tech startups in recent years.

        "text": "\n(Reuters) - U.S. retailers are gearing up for Black Friday, marking the start of the shopping season that follows the Thanksgiving holiday, while business activity data should gauge the temperature elsewhere.\nBritain's budget update is in the spotlight, while the yen might get some breathing space and Argentina heads for a key election.\nHere's your week ahead in world markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, and Naomi Rovnick, Dhara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London.\n1/ BARGAIN HUNTING\nThe crucial holiday shopping season kicks off with Black Friday on Nov. 24 at a time when investors are questioning whether the consumer-driven U.S. economy can remain resilient.\nThis year's Black Friday comes as Americans grapple with soaring interest rates and inflation that, while easing, remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\nAlready, data for October showed U.S. retail sales fell, pointing to slowing demand, although the decline was less than expected.\nThere's also likely to be plenty of interest in chip company Nvidia, which releases its latest earnings report on Nov. 21. It is the last of the results in the earnings season from the Magnificent 7 megacap companies, whose massive share gains this year have led equity indexes higher.\n2/ SOFT VS HARD\nSoft or hard landing? For sure, compelling arguments can be made for both. The European Commission expects the euro zone will avoid technical recession; Britain just sidestepped the start of one.\nThe forward-looking flash November PMIs due out globally should help investors assess recession risks and how quickly rate cuts will begin.\nThe euro zone PMI is already below the 50 number, suggesting economic activity is contracting. It is the same in Britain, while the U.S. Oct manufacturing PMI contracted sharply.\nBond heavyweight PIMCO sees the probability of a U.S. recession within one year at 50%. Market pricing for rate cuts suggests traders reckon economic growth will slow fast enough for the Fed and European Central Bank to switch to easing mode. And of course soft landing hopes could vanish fast if inflation eases more quickly and unemployment rises fast.\n3/ 11 DOWNING STREET\nUK politics has been dramatic, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak having fired his interior minister, moved former leader David Cameron back into government and reshuffled other top roles.\nFinance minister Jeremy Hunt will now change gear with his Nov. 22 Autumn Statement, focusing on boosting growth ahead of an expected 2024 election.\nAnalysts predict the government, hamstrung by a stagnant economy and high debt, won't make big investment pledges.\nStill, Hunt looks set to trim taxes for voters and businesses, offering some relief to the many Conservative lawmakers alarmed at the opposition Labour Party's big opinion poll lead. He could also downgrade near-term borrowing expectations, temporarily boosting gilts.\nNatwest says the UK may issue 10% more debt in 2024-2025 than in this fiscal year - a development that would amplify long-term concerns about gilt market oversupply.\n4/ DEATH, TAXES, WEAK YEN\nThere's an air of inevitability about a weaker yen, even with the Bank of Japan increasingly hinting at an end to ultra-loose policy and greater investor certainty that the Fed is done tightening.\nAfter pulling back from the brink of 152 per dollar at the start of the week, receiving a lifeline from cooling U.S. inflation data, the yen was back to the weaker side of 151 a day later. It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for traders, who saw support from weak U.S. payrolls numbers on Nov. 3 last only as long as the weekend.\nWhile gaping Japan-U.S. rate differentials do not bode well for the yen, the shift in policy directions should at least give forward-thinking markets some pause.\nAs long as that's not the case, pressure is on the Kishida cabinet since a weak yen is unpopular politically. And that means Tokyo is never too far from the intervention trigger.\n5/ PHOTO FINISH?\nArgentines elect a new president on Sunday in a closely fought race pitching center-left Peronist economy chief Sergio Massa against libertarian outsider Javier Milei and polls suggest a likely photo finish.\nThey offer two wildly different visions for South America's No. 2 economy: Milei's potentially painful shock therapy for the embattled country that has run out of FX reserves, inflation running at over 140% and faces recession. Pragmatist Massa pledges a unity government and more gradual change to solve the crisis that has worsened on his watch.\nInvestors are bracing for rocky times, with Argentina's crucial $44 billion IMF programme on the ropes and international bonds priced at deeply distressed levels.\nAnd there's more election-induced volatility ahead in emerging markets with Egypt, Taiwan, South Africa and India just some facing key ballots in coming months.\n(Compiled by Karin Strohecker and Dhara Ranasinghe; Graphics by Prinz Magtulis, Sumanta Sen, Kripa Jayaram, Pasit Kongkunakornkul; Editing by Mark Potter)",

Novo first sued Brooksville in July, and discovered a substance called BPC-157 in samples from Wells.\nBoth cases were filed in Florida on Wednesday.\nBrooksville managing partner Terry Myers said in an email the company disputes the new allegations and plans to file another motion to dismiss. Wells did not respond to a request for comment by email on Thursday.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned BPC-157 from use in compounded drugs in September, saying it did not have enough data to know whether it was harmful to humans, but that it could cause dangerous immune system reactions.\nNovo said the compounded versions of Wegovy tested from Brooksville were also less potent than advertised, with one sample shown to be at least 19% weaker than indicated.\n\u201cCompounded products do not have the same safety, quality and effectiveness assurances as FDA-approved drugs, and adulterated and misbranded injectable compounded drugs may expose patients to significant health risks,\u201d Jason Brett, a Novo Nordisk executive, said in a statement.\nNovo said the lawsuits aim to stop the two pharmacies from selling products claiming to contain semaglutide - the main ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic - and prevent Wells Pharmacy from claiming its products are FDA approved or that BPC-157 has health benefits without making customers aware of its safety risks.\nBrooksville's Myers said the company buys its bulk ingredients, including semaglutide, from FDA-registered facilities.\nIt has tested its formulation with a third-party lab and found it remains potent for 180 days when stored in a refrigerator, 90 days when stored at room temperature and 45 days when stored at 40 degrees Celsius.\nNovo has already filed 12 lawsuits against medical spas, weight-loss clinics and compounding pharmacies offering products that claim to contain semaglutide.\nThe company said it had obtained temporary orders against six of those to stop them claiming their products are authentic, FDA approved or associated with Novo Nordisk.\nNovo's biggest rival in the obesity drug market, Eli Lilly , has also sued several medical spas, weight-loss clinics and compounding pharmacies this year to stop them from selling products purporting to contain tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its diabetes drug Mounjaro and recently-approved weight loss medicine Zepbound.\nThe case against Wells was filed in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, Ocala division and the suit against Brooksville in U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, Tampa division.

        "text": "\nWhatever Americans are grateful for, the Joe Biden economy isn\u2019t on the list.\nThe 2024 holiday season is set to highlight the cognitive dissonance of American consumers who think everything is terrible but keep spending money anyway. The University of Michigan Sentiment Index has dropped for four months in a row and is at deeply recessionary levels. Yet early holiday spending is up 5% over last year\u2019s levels and retailers expect that to hold up through the end of the year for a solid end to 2024.\nInflation is the national depressant. The rate of inflation has slowed sharply, from a peak of 8.9% in 2022 to just 3.2% now. But the combined price hikes of the last two years mean that some things remain uncomfortably expensive. Perhaps more importantly, prices are just higher than people think they should be.\nBiden and his economic advisers often point to things coming down in price as evidence that inflation is on the run and everything ought to be fine. The problem, however, is that many prices are down from peak levels but still a lot higher than they used to be. Normal people get to choose what to use as their basis for comparison, and for many people, the right price of something is the cheapest they remember it being.\nA Thanksgiving dinner will cost 4.5% less this year than last, for instance. But it\u2019s still 14.7% costlier than in 2021 and 25% more expensive than in 2019, the last year before the COVID pandemic. So, bad.\nGasoline costs 11% less than it did a year ago and 3% less than it did two years ago. But don\u2019t get too optimistic, because pump prices are still 27% higher than they were in 2019.\nIf you\u2019re planning to fly for holiday travel, the typical flight will cost 13% less than last year. But airfares are still 24% higher than they were in 2021. Airfares are lower than they were in 2019, but memories fail when the news is good.\nIf you\u2019re that rare person who gives your spouse a car for Christmas, it\u2019ll cost 2% more than one year ago, 10% more than two years ago, and 23% more than four years ago.\nAnd while splurging on gifts, you still need to pay rent, which may be the biggest bummer of all: up 7% in a year, 15% in two years, and 22% in four years.\nThere\u2019s almost always some inflation. What we\u2019ve learned from the Biden-era bout of inflation is that price hikes only become a problem when people notice them. The Federal Reserve likes to keep inflation around 2%, which is more or less the average from 2000 through 2020. At 2% inflation, the cost of a gallon of milk would rise from $4.36 to $4.44 in a year. Price hawks might notice, but most people wouldn\u2019t. And incomes normally grow by a little bit more than inflation, so that extra $0.08 would be offset by $0.10 or $0.12 in additional income.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nDuring the last two years, everybody on a budget has noticed the higher cost of cereal, electricity, eating out, and even pet food. That\u2019s why Biden\u2019s approval rating is stuck at a weak 40%, with voters rating him even worse on his handling of the economy. Americans are so unnerved by inflation that they expect it to keep getting worse even though it has been consistently getting better. Economists forecast even lower inflation in 2024, but people don\u2019t believe them.\nBiden needs two things to improve his standing with voters, along with his 2024 reelection odds. One is outright price declines in some products and services that are important to shoppers. The second is consumer awareness that prices are actually falling.\nThe holiday shopping season could brighten spirits. A few things are already cheaper than they were in 2022, 2021, and even 2019, including toys and electronics. Walmart\u2019s CEO and other retail executives say they\u2019re prepared to offer excessive discounting to keep shoppers streaming in. Some stock analysts worry that firms are losing their \u201cpricing power,\u201d another way of saying supply is finally outstripping demand after three years of COVID-related distortions.\nEntering 2024, Biden needs food and rent inflation to flatline and, ideally, go into reverse, with staples of some prices falling back toward levels from 2021, when Biden took office. Any chance of that? Call it a coin toss. What seems clearer is that nobody is thankful for a falling rate of price increases. It will take falling prices before anybody celebrates.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\nBy Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) - - Kyle Vogt, the CEO of General Motors' robot-taxi unit Cruise, has resigned from the company a day after apologizing to staff as the company undergoes a safety review of its U.S. fleet.\nVogt, 38, offered little in the way of explanation, stating simply \"I have resigned from my position\" in an email to staff viewed by Reuters on Sunday. Vogt founded Cruise in 2013.\nHis decision follows weeks of turmoil at the unit, which had to pull all its vehicles from testing in the United States to conduct a safety review after an Oct. 2 accident that ended with one of Cruise's self-driving taxis dragging a pedestrian.\nA source familiar with the circumstances of Vogt's resignation said Vogt had informed the board of his decision to leave on Sunday after apologizing to staff for the company's problems in an email on Saturday.\n\"As CEO, I take responsibility for the situation Cruise is in today. There are no excuses, and there is no sugar coating what has happened. We need to double down on safety, transparency, and community engagement,\" he wrote in the email, reported exclusively by Reuters.\nCruise's woes are also a setback for an industry dependent on public trust and the cooperation of regulators. The unit had in recent months touted ambitious plans to expand to more cities, offering fully autonomous taxi rides.\nVogt's resignation came after GM and the board at Cruise increased their scrutiny of its leadership.\nThe Cruise board met on Nov. 13 and the next day named GM general counsel Craig Glidden as Cruise's chief administrative officer. The board also said it would retain a third-party safety expert to assess safety operations and culture.\nGM CEO Mary Barra said in an email to employees seen by Reuters that Glidden will serve as Cruise's co-president with Mo Elshenawy, who will also become chief technology officer.\n\"We continue to believe strongly in Cruise's mission and the potential of its transformative technology as we look to make transportation safer, cleaner and more accessible,\" she said.\nFormer Tesla President Jon McNeill, a GM director since 2022, was named vice chairman of the Cruise board alongside Barra, who is the chair.\nCruise competes with Alphabet\u2019s Waymo in deploying autonomous vehicles and had been testing hundreds in several cities across the U.S., notably its home of San Francisco.\nIn October, the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Cruise to remove its driverless cars from state roads, calling them a risk to the public and saying the company had misrepresented the safety of its technology.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in October opened an investigation into pedestrian risks at Cruise and the Cruise board hired law firm Quinn Emanuel to review Cruise management's responses to regulators investigating the Oct. 2 accident.\n\"The last 10 years have been amazing, and I'm grateful to everyone who helped Cruise along the way,\" Vogt wrote in his email. In a post on social media platform X shortly after his resignation, he added: \"Cruise is still just getting started, and I believe it has a great future ahead.\"\nBarra has told investors Cruise could generate $50 billion in revenue by 2030. The operation lost more than $700 million in the third quarter of this year on its plans to expand operations to 15 U.S. cities.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; additional reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Kenneth Li and Miral Fahmy)",

At the same time, Microsoft remains a frequent target of critics, who complain that its software is prone to flaws, making it a frequent target for criminal and nation-state hackers.\nThose problems resurfaced earlier this year, when hackers used a stolen consumer signing key to forge authentication tokens, which are meant to verify a user\u2019s identity. They then accessed user email from about 25 organizations, including US government agencies. Among the victims was US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and State Department officials, whose emails were accessed just ahead of a meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Microsoft tied the hackers to China.\nRead More: Commerce Chief Raimondo\u2019s Email Hacked in Breach Tied to China\nUS Senator Ron Wyden wrote a blistering letter on July 27 about the lapse, calling for an investigation, and shortly thereafter, a government-led cybersecurity advisory panel opened a probe into the risks of cloud computing, which includes a look into Microsoft\u2019s role in the email hack.\n\u201cGovernment emails were stolen because Microsoft committed another error,\u201d Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said in his letter. \u201cMicrosoft should not have had a single skeleton key that, when inevitably stolen, could be used to forge access to different customers\u2019 private communications.\u201d\nAmit Yoran, the chief executive officer of the cybersecurity company Tenable Holdings Inc., also criticized Microsoft, saying on LinkedIn in August that the company\u2019s \u201clack of transparency applies to breaches, irresponsible security practices and to vulnerabilities, all of which expose their customers to risks they are deliberately kept in the dark about.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s announcement, called the Secure Future Initiative, comes after the federal government has indicated that it expects software makers to take more responsibility for securing their products. In February, for instance, Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said bad software and unsafe practices are facilitating ransomware attacks, and she said the adoption of some of Microsoft\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s security protocols such as two-factor authentication was disappointing.\nRead More: US Cyber Leader Urges Microsoft, Twitter to Up User Security\nAnd, on Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Texas-based SolarWinds Corp., alleging the company defrauded investors by downplaying security risks ahead of a hack of its software. In that cyberattack, which became public in December 2020, Russian state-sponsored hackers inserted malware into an update for a popular SolarWinds software product, creating a digital backdoor when customers downloaded it.\nThe hackers used that backdoor to further infiltrate about 100 organizations, including US government agencies, according to the SEC. The lesson of the SEC suit was that security professionals shouldn\u2019t sugarcoat problems that they are seeing and be more transparent about them, Michael Coates, chief information security officer at CoinList and a former security head at Twitter, told Bloomberg News.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Smith said the company is committed to building an AI-based cyber shield to protect customers and countries around the world.\n\u201cOne reason these AI advances are so important is because of their ability to address one of the world\u2019s most pressing cybersecurity challenges,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUbiquitous devices and constant internet connections have created a vast sea of digital data.\u201d\n\u201cBut AI is a game changer,\u201d he said.\nIn addition, Microsoft said it will use AI-powered analysis and other measures to audit and secure code against advanced threats, and it vowed to strengthen identity protection at a time when password attacks have increased and hackers have developed more sophisticated methods to steal and use login credentials. As part of the latter initiative, Microsoft said it would migrate to a \u201cnew and fully automated consumer and enterprise key management system with an architecture designed to ensure that keys remain inaccessible even when underlying processes may be corrupted.\u201d\nIn her criticism of Microsoft earlier this year, Easterly said that Microsoft needs to \u201crecapture the ethos\u201d of what company co-founder Bill Gates called \u201ctrustworthy computing\u201d in 2002. At that time, Microsoft was reeling from computer worms, and Gates wrote a memo ordering software developers to prioritize security. \u201cWe can and must do better,\u201d he wrote.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nMarvel\u2019s Latest Movie Will Show If Superheroes Ever Get Tired\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 One year ago, billionaire and new owner Elon Musk walked into Twitter's San Francisco headquarters with a white bathroom sink and a grin, fired its CEO and other top executives and began transforming the social media platform into what is now known as X.\nX looks and feels something like Twitter, but the more time you spend on it the clearer it becomes that it's merely an approximation. Musk has dismantled core features of what made Twitter, Twitter \u2014 its name and blue bird logo, its verification system, its Trust and Safety advisory group. Not to mention content moderation and hate speech enforcement.\nHe also fired, laid off or lost the majority of its workforce \u2014 engineers who keep the site running, moderators who keep it from being overrun with hate, executives in charge of making rules and enforcing them.\nThe result, long-term Twitter watchers say, has been the end of the platform's role as an imperfect but useful place to find out what's going on in the world. What X will become, and whether Musk can achieve his ambition of turning it into an \u201ceverything app\u201d that everyone uses, remains as unclear as it was a year ago.\n\u201cMusk hasn\u2019t managed to make a single meaningful improvement to the platform and is no closer to his vision of an \u2018everything app,\u2019 than he was a year ago,\" said Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cInstead, X has driven away users, advertisers, and now it has lost its primary value proposition in the social media world: Being a central hub for news.\u201d\nAs one of the platform's most popular and prolific users even before he bought the company, Musk had a unique experience on Twitter that is markedly different from how regular users experience it. But many of the changes he's introduced to X has been based on his own impressions of the site \u2014 in fact, he even polled his millions of followers for advice on how to run it (they said he should step down).\n\u201cMusk\u2019s treatment of the platform as a technology company that he could remake in his vision rather than a social network fueled by people and ad dollars has been the single largest cause of the demise of Twitter,\u201d Enberg said.\nThe blue checkmarks that once signified that the person or institution behind an account was who they said they are \u2014 a celebrity, athlete, journalist from global or local publication, a nonprofit agency \u2014 now merely shows that someone pays $8 a month for a subscription service that boosts their posts above un-checked users. It\u2019s these paying accounts that have been found to spread misinformation on the platform that is often amplified by its algorithms.\nOn Thursday, for instance, a new report from the left-leaning nonprofit Media Matters found that numerous blue-checked X accounts with tens of thousands of followers claimed that the mass shooting in Maine was a \u201cfalse flag,\u201d planned by the government. Researchers also found such accounts spreading misinformation and propaganda about the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 so much so that the European Commission made a formal, legally binding request for information to X over its handling of hate speech, misinformation and violent terrorist content related to the war.\nIan Bremmer, a prominent foreign policy expert, posted on X this month that the level of disinformation on the Israel-Hamas war \u201cbeing algorithmically promoted\u201d on the platform \u201cis unlike anything I\u2019ve ever been exposed to in my career as a political scientist.\u201d\nIt's not just the platform's identity that's on shaky grounds. Twitter was already struggling financially when Musk purchased it for $44 billion in a deal that closed Oct. 27, 2022, and the situation appears more precarious today. Musk took the company private, so its books are no longer public \u2014 but in July, the Tesla CEO said the company had lost about half of its advertising revenue and continues to face a large debt load.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still negative cash flow,\" he posted on the site on July 14, due to about a \"50% drop in advertising revenue plus heavy debt load.\"\n\u201cNeed to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else,\u201d he said.\nIn May, Musk hired Linda Yaccarino, a former NBC executive with deep ties to the advertising industry in an attempt to lure back top brands, but the effort has been slow to pay off. While some advertisers have returned to X, they are not spending as much as they did in the past \u2014 despite a rebound in the online advertising market that boosted the most recent quarterly profits for Facebook parent company, Meta, and Google parent company, Alphabet.\nInsider Intelligence estimates that X will bring in $1.89 billion in advertising revenue this year, down 54% from 2022. The last time its ad revenue was near this level was in 2015, when it came in at $1.99 billion. In 2022, it was $4.12 billion according to the research firm's estimates.\nOutside research also shows that people are using X less.\nAccording to research firm Similarweb, global web traffic to Twitter.com was down 14%, year-over-year, and traffic to the ads.twitter.com portal for advertisers was down 16.5%. Performance on mobile was no better, down 17.8% year-over-year based on combined monthly active users for Apple's iOS and Android.\n\u201cEven though the cultural relevance of Twitter was already starting to decline,\" before Musk took it over, \"it\u2019s as if the platform no longer exists. And it\u2019s been a death by a thousand cuts,\u201d Enberg said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really fascinating is that almost all of the wounds have been self-inflicted. Usually when a social platform, starts to lose its relevance there are at least some external factors at play, but that\u2019s not the case here.\u201d",

Among the uncertainties is aid for Ukraine.\nThe government had planned to double military aid to Ukraine to 8 billion euros next year but a defence ministry spokesperson would not be drawn on whether the pledge would be kept, referring to ongoing to discussions.\n\"The political fallout from Germany\u2019s constitutional court ruling continues to rock German politics and is now impacting EU politics as well, making a deal over a revised EU budget a lot less likely at the 14-15 December European Council, and even threatening the bloc\u2019s \u20ac50bn commitment to fund Ukraine through 2027,\" said a note by the Eurasia Group.\nINDUSTRY URGES CLARITY\nGreens Economy Minister Robert Habeck has warned that Germany's place as an investment hub is at stake, as well as jobs, and industry chiefs have called for clarity quickly.\n\"German industry is looking at the current political situation with the greatest concern,\" said Siegfried Russwurm, president of the BDI industry association.\nUnderscoring the jitters, a minister in the state of Saxony-Anhalt warned the billions in subsidies for U.S. chipmaker were at risk.\nSuch a move, and a similar threat to investments by Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC, would undercut Germany's plans to base critical industry on home soil as part of a policy overhaul after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nSo far, Berlin has stuck by an agreement for 10 billion euros in subsidies with Intel, which will develop two chipmaking plants.\n\"I firmly assume that the commitments for Intel and TSMC will remain,\" a government source said, adding: \"This is very important to the chancellor, as well as to the economy minister.\"\nThe influential VDA autos association, which represents giants like BMW and Volkswagen as well as smaller suppliers, urged the government to provide a clear, reliable basis for planning as quickly as possible.\nThe government must be \"more committed and determined than before in pushing ahead with energy partnerships and trade and raw materials agreements to strengthen Germany as an industrial location,\" a spokesperson for the VDA said.\nIndustrial firm Thyssenkrupp acknowledged that the budget ructions may have repercussions on Germany's hydrogen sector, a nascent industry Scholz has pinned a lot of hopes on.\n\"We need to get ... into conversations with possible suppliers of hydrogen and then get answers from them. This will happen in the course of next early 2024 and we will see how far hydrogen is available,\" CEO Miguel Lopez said.

DBS also has no direct exposure to the conflict in the Middle East, he added.\nThe bank's July-September net profit rose to S$2.63 billion ($1.94 billion) from S$2.24 billion a year earlier as total income grew to a record on higher interest margins and fee income.\nThat beat the mean estimate of S$2.5 billion from four analysts surveyed by LSEG.\nNevertheless, specific allowances of S$197 million were higher than recent quarters as the bank set aside contingencies for exposure linked to a suspected money laundering case in Singapore, one of the country's largest ever. The scandal has led to banks sharpening their scrutiny.\nGupta also expected the bank's 2024 net interest income to be around this year's level, and fee income momentum to be sustained by wealth management and cards.\nHe also forecast next year's profit before allowances to be higher, and total allowances to normalise to 17-20 basis points of loans, according to the statement.\n\"DBS seems to provide some reassurances that it sees the higher-for-longer interest rates as a net benefit to its earnings into 2024,\" said Yeap Jun Rong, IG Asia's market analyst. \"This provides some much-needed comfort, at a time where loan demand continues to soften.\"\nBesides higher global interest rates, Singapore banks have benefited from strong inflows of wealth drawn in by the city-state's political stability.\nBut global economic uncertainty could weigh on Singapore's economic prospects.

Part of the Fed\u2019s goal is too cool the economy and labor market, which officials say should slow price growth.\nIn September, consumer prices were up 3.7% from a year earlier, down from a peak 9.1% in June last year. However, U.S. economic growth surged in the July-September quarter on the back of robust consumer spending.\nThe Labor Department reported last week that employers posted 9.6 million job openings in September, up from 9.5 million in August. Layoffs fell to 1.5 million from 1.7 million.\nU.S. private employers slowed their hiring in October, adding a modest but still decent 150,000 jobs.\nLast month\u2019s job growth, though down sharply from a robust 297,000 gain in September, was solid enough to suggest that many companies still want to hire and that the economy remains sturdy.",

        "date": "2023-10-31T12:49:14.000Z",
        "text": "\nBy Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor costs increased solidly in the third quarter amid strong wage growth while house price inflation accelerated in August, the latest signs that the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates high for some time.\nThe reports on Tuesday pose a threat to efforts by the U.S. central bank to bring inflation to its 2% target. Fed officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged but maintain its hawkish bias at the conclusion of that meeting as a recent spike in U.S. Treasury yields and stock market sell-off have tightened financial conditions.\n\"Those wage increases are likely to keep inflation running above target while higher house prices could lead to a pick-up in shelter inflation,\" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup in New York. \"For now the Fed will remain on-hold, but the evident upside risk to inflation means Chair (Jerome) Powell and committee will keep potential further rate hikes on the table.\"\nThe Employment Cost Index (ECI), the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 1.1% last quarter after increasing 1.0% in the April-June period, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI would rise 1.0%.\nLabor costs increased 4.3% on a year-on-year basis, the smallest gain since the fourth quarter of 2021, after advancing by 4.5% in the second quarter. Growth in annual compensation is gradually slowing after peaking at 5.1% last year, in line with some easing in labor market conditions. It, however, remains well above the pre-pandemic pace.\nThe rise in compensation helps to explain the surge in consumer spending last quarter, which contributed to the fastest economic growth rate in nearly two years.\nThe ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation because it adjusts for composition and job-quality changes. Since March 2022, the Fed has raised its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range.\nWages increased 1.2% in the third quarter after climbing 1.0% in the prior three months. They were up 4.6% on a year-on-year basis after advancing by the same margin in the second quarter. Strong wage growth is being driven by worker shortages that still persist in some services industries.\nSeptember's job openings data on Wednesday will shed light on the state of demand for labor.\nThough consumers continue to worry about the economy's outlook, more are planning vacations over the next six months and are not contemplating scaling back in a major way on purchases of motor vehicles and other big-ticket items, according to a survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday.\nTheir concerns about the economy center around the violence in the Middle East as well as domestic politics, likely reflecting the protracted battle to elect a speaker in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nThe Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, rose to 26.3 from 25.5 in September. This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. Overall, the consumer confidence index dropped moderately to 102.6 this month from 104.3 in September.\n\"The U.S. consumer is in okay financial shape,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas. \"For well-off Americans, inflation is a source of frustration but not enough to force cutbacks in overall spending.\"\nStocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.\nCONSUMER CONFIDENCE EBBS\nThe compensation report showed private-sector wages gained 1.1% after rising 1.0% in the April-June quarter. They advanced 4.5% on a year-on-year basis. There were notable increase in wages in the financial activities and education and health services sectors. But wage growth slowed in the leisure and hospitality industry, which had experienced worker shortages.\nManufacturing also reported a moderation in wage gains.\nState and local government wages shot up 1.8% after increasing 0.8% in the prior quarter. They were driven by rises in education and health services as well as public administration. State and local government wages increased 4.8% on a year-on-year basis, the most since the government started tracking the series in 2001.\nInflation-adjusted wages for all workers rose 0.9% on a year-on-year basis after jumping 1.7% in the second quarter. While slowing, wages should continue to underpin spending.\nBenefits rose 0.9% last quarter after climbing by the same margin in the April-June period. They increased 4.1% on a year-on-year basis.\nEconomists expected the higher wages and benefits to pressure corporate profits, with Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic noting that \"some companies are losing a bit of their pricing power.\"\nA third report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showed house prices increased 0.6% in August, driven by an acute shortage of previously owned homes. House prices rose 0.8% in July. While lofty house prices are boosting household wealth, they could keep inflation elevated in the near-term.\nIn the 12 months through August, house prices accelerated 5.6% after advancing 4.6% in July. With the rate on the popular fixed 30-year mortgage near 8%, some economists see limited scope for house prices to keep rising, which would result in rents contributing less to inflation.\nHigher rents were the major drivers of inflation in September after cooling somewhat in prior months.\nEven as house prices continue to march higher, there are signs that shelter inflation could moderate next year.\nA fourth report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showed the rental vacancy rate jumped 6.6% in the third quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2021, from 6.3% in the April-June period.\n\"We still think it is likely that the surge in mortgage rates will slow the rise in prices in the secondary market going forward,\" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP in New York.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Deepa Babington)",

While the fines are relatively small, they are among the biggest the watchdog has ever issued and indicate that the inspection deal, a decade in the making, is working as hoped.\n\"\nThe days of China-based firms evading accountability are over. The PCAOB is demonstrating that we will take action to protect investors in U.S. markets and impose tough sanctions against anyone who violates PCAOB rules and standards, no matter where they are located,\" said PCAOB chair Erica Williams in a statement.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers firms in Hong Kong and China agreed to pay a total of $7 million for violating quality control standards after they failed to detect or prevent extensive answer-sharing on mandatory training courses, the PCAOB said.\n\"After becoming aware of these issues, the firms investigated these matters promptly and took remedial action,\" the PwC affiliates said in a joint statement, noting they reported the problems to the PCAOB.\nThe PCAOB also fined Shandong Haoxin Certified Public Accountants Co., Ltd. and four accountants $940,000 for violations including issuing a false audit report and failing to maintain independence from a public company client. The individuals are also facing industry bars of varying lengths, the PCAOB said.\nHaoxin did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\nThe U.S. has for years worried that the auditors of U.S.-listed Chinese companies were falling down on the job, putting investors at risk. But Beijing had resisted allowing the PCAOB access to its auditors' records, citing state secrecy concerns.\nIn August 2022, the two countries - spurred on by a new U.S. law that threatened to kick potentially 200 Chinese companies off U.S. exchanges - finally agreed a framework for beginning inspections of eight audits.\nIn May, the PCAOB said it found a slew of deficiencies in audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies performed by PwC in Hong Kong and KPMG. At the time, the watchdog said it was common to find issues when first accessing a country's auditors.\nIt did not disclose which companies' audits it had selected for inspection, but Reuters\nhas previously reported that Alibaba Group Holding and Yum China Holdings were among them.\nThe PCAOB's inspection in the region continue and the regulator continues to have \"complete access\" in its inspections, Williams said on Thursday.\n\"American investors are better protected when the PCAOB can audit the auditors of issuers listed in the United States,\" U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.

The man in Rijeka had reportedly consumed Romerquelle Emotion Blueberry Pomegranate from a glass bottle, while the student in Zagreb was said to have drunk Coca-Cola from a plastic bottle he took from a machine at his faculty. Another similar case had been previously reported in May.\nA hospital in Rijeka on Tuesday said the man was treated for chemical injuries to the esophagus.\n\u201cThose are probably some corrosive materials and we need to see if there are any added elements in the drink,\" said Krunoslav Capak, the head of Croatia's Public Health Institute.",

The dollar was last up 1.7% at 151.56 yen, on track for its best one-day increase since late April.\nThe euro jumped against the Japanese currency to a 15-year high of 160.84 yen, and was last up 1.3% at 160.20 yen . It was on pace for its biggest daily gain since late July.\n\"Currency traders unquestionably have their knives out for the yen after last night's dangerously-ambiguous policy change from the Bank of Japan,\" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto.\n\"With major unknowns remaining around the central bank\u2019s reaction function, and another raft of stronger-than-expected data helping boost US yields, rate differentials are tilting more aggressively against the yen as the session unfolds.\u201d\nWhile shares in Europe gained as investors drew comfort from resilient regional results, Asian equities earlier lost ground on renewed fears over the prospects for the Chinese economy following weak manufacturing data.\nOn Wall Street, heavy-machinery maker Caterpillar fell as dealer inventories rose and a large order backlog shrank, indicating demand is slowing. Pfizer's shares were flat after the drugmaker reported its first quarterly loss since 2019.\nInvestors are waiting to see what the Fed says after a two-day policy meeting ends on Wednesday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 135.04 points, or 0.41%, to 33,064, the S&P 500 gained 27.83 points, or 0.67%, to 4,194.65 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.13 points, or 0.51%, to 12,854.61.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.59% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.33%.\nLonger-dated Treasury yields dipped as investors awaited the Fed statement and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last week hit 16-year highs as investors contemplate higher yields for longer, and on concerns about increasing U.S. Treasury supply.\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose 0.3 basis points to 4.880%.\nEuro zone yields fell as individual country inflation data pointed to a lower print for the currency bloc overall later in the day. Germany's benchmark 10-year yield fell 5.5 basis points to 2.77%, testing the previous day's two-week low.\nOil prices eased as investors worried less about potential supply disruptions from the Middle East. Also, data showed rising output from OPEC and the United States.\nBrent crude futures for December delivery, settled 4 cents lower at $87.41 a barrel, ahead of their expiry later on Tuesday. The more heavily traded January contract fell $1.33, or 1.4%\uff0cto $85.02. U.S. crude for December delivery fell $1.29, or 1.6%, to $81.02, while those for January delivery fell $1.18 to $80.50.\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch and Herbert Lash in New York; additional reporting by Tom Wilson in London and Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Nick Zieminski)",

        "text": "\nMANCHESTER, England, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Manchester City offered a gleeful reminder of the gulf in class between themselves and Manchester United with a dismissive 3-0 win at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday.\nThe weekend's big clash turned out to be painfully one-sided as Erling Haaland struck twice to move into double figures for Premier League goals this season while Phil Foden was also on target for Pep Guardiola's side.\nLiverpool consolidated their place in the top four with a 3-0 home victory against Nottingham Forest while fifth-placed Aston Villa racked up a 12th successive home league win as they cruised to a 3-1 defeat of struggling Luton Town.\nEverton enjoyed a poignant 1-0 victory at West Ham United, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin scoring the only goal at the London Stadium, at the end of a week in which chairman Bill Kenwright died at the age of 78. The win moved Everton up to 15th.\nIn the day's other match, Brighton & Hove Albion drew 1-1 at home to Fulham as their winless run extended to four games.\nCity's victory lifted the champions to 24 points, the same as Arsenal who thrashed Sheffield United 5-0 on Saturday and two points behind surprise leaders Tottenham Hotspur who beat Crystal Palace on Friday.\nUnited are eighth -- nine points behind City and on the evidence of Sunday that gap will only get bigger.\n\"It's different levels. The United players are just short in every aspect. Technically and tactically. It's a long way back for this team,\" former United captain Roy Keane told Sky Sports.\nErik Ten Hag's side had appeared to have turned a corner with narrow league wins over Brentford and Sheffield United and a Champions League victory against FC Copenhagen.\nBut those wins papered over the cracks and City exposed them with ruthless efficiency in a dominant display that left United sucking up a fifth defeat in their opening 10 Premier League games of the season -- the most since 1986-87.\nHAALAND'S FIRST GOALS AT OLD TRAFFORD\nThe match began with moving tributes to Manchester United great Bobby Charlton who died last weekend but any sense that the hosts could produce a display the iconic Charlton would have been proud of soon vanished.\nHaaland scored with a 26th-minute penalty -- his first goal at Old Trafford -- after United striker Rasmus Hojlund was penalised for dragging down Rodri.\nThe Norwegian then rammed home a header from Bernardo Silva's cross to make it 2-0 shortly after the break, his 11th league goal of the season, and he turned provider to set up Foden to complete United's misery as the rain tumbled down.\n\"It is definitely one of the best wins. To win 3-0 away with this crowd, I think it is definitely one of the best performances,\" Haaland said.\nGoals by Diogo Jota, Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah eased Liverpool to victory over Forest although the win was overshadowed by events off the field.\nAfter scoring the opener, Jota held up the shirt of team mate Luis Diaz, who missed the game following the kidnapping of his parents in his native Colombia.\n\"Luis was with us in the hotel, then he went home. It's a very hard situation and I don't know how anyone would react if it happened to you,\" Jota told the BBC.\nWhile the victory was welcome, manager Juergen Klopp also said his thoughts had been with Diaz.\n\"Preparation was the most difficult I had in my life. Didn't expect it, couldn't prepare for it, We try to help Lucho (Diaz) as much as we can,\" he said.\nAston Villa are turning their stadium into a fortress and Luton were the latest team to succumb there.\nJohn McGinn gave Unai Emery's side the lead in the 17th minute and Moussa Diaby rifled in a shot four minutes into the second half before a Tom Lockyer own goal just past the hour mark put Villa in cruise control.\nThe only blot on Villa's copybook was a bizarre own goal when a defensive header hit the crossbar and rebounded into the net off keeper Emiliano Martinez.

We are continuing to work closely with relevant government agencies and are focusing on ensuring a sustainable supply,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. company told Reuters in a statement.\nTirzepatide is the name of the active ingredient in Mounjaro. A launch is expected to touch off fierce competition with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy injection drug in a booming weight-loss market.\nThe Lilly spokesperson added that the injection device in question would be different from the pen that Lilly plans to use for the weight-loss drug in the United States, where it was rebranded as Zepbound. Within the United Kingdom, Lilly will use one pen type for both uses against type 2 diabetes and obesity.\nBritain's drug regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said it could not comment on any device applications, citing commercial confidentiality.\nNearly one in three adults are obese in Britain, the highest in Europe, according to a 2019 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report.\nOverweight-related illnesses account for 8.4% of health expenditure and when combined with lower labour market output, it reduces UK GDP by 3.4%, it said. Obesity is usually defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above.\nThe Lilly drug already has approval for type 2 diabetes but has yet to be launched by the manufacturer in this indication in the UK.\nAsked when it would be available for weight loss in Britain, Lilly would not give a date.\n\"Before launching a new treatment Lilly needs to ensure that it can appropriately supply the medicine, considering many factors including expected demand and competitive supply,\" it said in a statement.\nNEW DRUG COULD HELP THOUSANDS\nBritain's health secretary welcomed the prospect of a new weight-loss treatment, saying it could help thousands of people.\n\"Tackling obesity could help cut waiting lists and save the NHS (National Health Service) billions of pounds,\" Steve Barclay said in a statement.\nHe said further approvals were needed before the drug can be covered by the NHS.\nDavid Strain, associate professor of cardiometabolic health at the University of Exeter, who sees type 2 diabetes patients in the state-run health system, urged steps against the promotion of unhealthy food as patients wait for the new drug.\n\u201cIt is great that tirzepatide has been approved, but we are not going to have that in our hands soon, and the government is currently trying to distract from the fact that we are not yet implementing upstream measures to prevent obesity in the first place,\u201d said Strain.\nA spokesperson for NHS England said the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, is assessing the treatment.\nA spokesperson for the cost-effectiveness body said that NICE planned to publish final guidance on its appraisal on tirzepatide for weight management and diabetes in March 2024.\nTirzepatide has been available under the Mounjaro brand name for type 2 diabetes since 2022 in the United States. It is not yet available in Britain.\nNICE in October published guidance on Mounjaro for treating type 2 diabetes, saying it would be given to patients with poorly controlled diabetes who suffer from certain levels of obesity or medical conditions.\nFrom the moment of publication, NHS has three months to make tirzepatide available to be prescribed.\n(Reporting by Maggie Fick in London and Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt Editing by David Goodman, Tomasz Janowski and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

Moody\u2019s has scheduled a potential update on the country for Friday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a rosy picture for Italy right now, but it\u2019s still not a situation in which you would think they could go to non-investment grade,\u201d Kraemer, who is now chief economist at LBBW in the southwest German city of Stuttgart, said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t really think Moody\u2019s will do it, because there\u2019s really no reason.\u201d\nAn announcement would be the first since Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni unveiled a budget in September featuring a looser fiscal stance. That caused the spread between Italian and German bond yields, a key measure of risk, to widen to 210 basis points for the first time since January.\nDespite that shift in profile for the public finances, both Fitch Ratings and S&P maintained stable views on the country a level higher than the Moody\u2019s assessment of Baa3 \u2014 just one step above junk, with a negative outlook. Any lower would mean describing Italy as a \u201csubstantial credit risk.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot explain how they ended up in this situation,\u201d said Kraemer. \u201cThey\u2019ve dug themselves into a hole.\u201d\nThat perspective is founded on his experience as a key behind-the-scenes protagonist of Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis earlier this century.\nPivotal calls Kraemer oversaw as S&P\u2019s chief sovereign analyst in the region for more than a decade included Italy\u2019s first downgrade since it joined the euro, in 2004. Six years later, he and his colleagues cut Greece to junk, intensifying the turmoil engulfing the country and shaking markets globally.\n\u201cWe all know from experience that if you go below the investment-grade divide, things will happen,\u201d Kraemer said. \u201cWe saw it with Greece, so there needs to be thought before action. But Greece is one thing, Italy is quite another \u2014 just looking at the size of their debt and economy.\u201d\nCompared with its two major rivals, Moody\u2019s has the widest spectrum of assessments of members of the Group of Seven.\nThe US\u2019s last remaining top credit rating is from the company, which put the country on a negative outlook last week. The Aaa assessment is now under threat because of wider budget deficits and political polarization.\nKraemer, who was at S&P in 2011 when it was first to strip the US of its top rating, observed that the comparison with Italy is significant.\n\u201cMoody\u2019s stance is all the more surprising because they have been very lenient on other developed markets \u2014 particularly if we look at the US,\u201d he said.\nEven though a downgrade isn\u2019t likely this week, Kraemer sees one reason why a cut to junk could make strategic sense.\n\u201cIf you do really believe Italy is on the way to non-investment grade level, then as a rating agency, you would want to be the first mover,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problems and the pressures start from the second rating agency.\u201d\nItaly Close to Junk\nMoody\u2019s placed its Baa3 rating on negative outlook in August 2022, citing accumulating risks:\n(1) \u201cHeightened risks that the political environment will impede the implementation of structural reforms, including those contained in Italy\u2019s National Recovery and Resilience Plan.\u201d\n(2) \u201cIncreased risk that energy supply challenges will weaken economic prospects.\u201d\n(3) \u201cRisks that Italy\u2019s fiscal strength will be further weakened by sluggish growth, higher funding costs, and potentially weaker fiscal discipline.\u201d\nAsked for a comment on the remarks, a spokesperson for Moody\u2019s said that the company\u2019s published research sets out the rationale behind its approach.\nInvestors share Kraemer\u2019s view that a downgrade is unlikely this week. The spread between 10-year Italian and German yields has stayed below 190 basis points in recent days and was at 183 points in early trading on Tuesday.\nKraemer acknowledges that Italy has no room for complacency, and Meloni\u2019s government shouldn\u2019t keep testing markets.\nHe sees the UK experience of turmoil last year under former Prime Minister Liz Truss as informative, not least since a big portion of Italy\u2019s debt is held by its citizens.\n\u201cThat should act as a strong disincentive to play with fire, and I still have some confidence that this political incentive will hold,\u201d Kraemer said. \u201cIn that sense, Liz Truss was a cautionary tale.\u201d\nMore generally, he says Italy\u2019s challenges are huge, ranging from poor growth and demographics, high borrowing costs, and large pension liabilities and health-care burdens.\nDebt as a percentage of gross domestic product is now seen by the International Monetary Fund as staying above 140%, even five years from now. Without a productivity revolution, its deficits will need to shrink, Kraemer said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a math wizard to figure out where the debt ratio is going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the house is on fire in Italy, but if we extrapolate current trends, it\u2019s going to end in tears.\u201d\n--With assistance from Alice Gledhill.\n(Updates with bond spread in 17th paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

In the past year and a half China has staged two large-scale war games around the island.\nTaiwan's foreign ministry, responding to the Biden-Xi meeting, said the government has never sought to predict whether or when China might attack but was concentrating on boosting its defenses and winning international support.\nThis is to \"let China understand the high importance the international community attaches to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the high price of starting a war, and to not act blindly without thinking,\" ministry spokesperson Jeff Liu said in Taipei.\nTaiwan will neither provoke nor \"advance rashly\" but will also not succumb to pressure, Liu said.\nBiden and Xi met for the first time in a year on Wednesday for talks aimed at easing friction between the two superpowers over military conflicts, drug-trafficking and artificial intelligence, and said they had made \"real progress.\"\nChina has stepped up military activity to try and force democratically governed Taiwan to accept Beijing's sovereignty, despite strong objections from Taipei government, which says only the island's people can decide their future.\nSenior U.S. military officers have said that Xi has ordered the People's Liberation Army to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027. Beijing has not ruled out using force to take the island, though it has never shared details about war preparations.

South Korea's military said the launch appeared to have failed.\nA U.S. Department of State spokesperson said South Korea's decision to suspend part of the agreement was a \"prudent and restrained response,\" citing North Korea's \"failure to adhere to the agreement.\"\n\"The ROK suspension will restore surveillance and reconnaissance activities along the ROK side of the Military Demarcation Line, improving the ROK's ability to monitor DPRK threats,\" the official said, referring to South Korea and North Korea respectively by the initials of their official names.\nThe suspended North-South pact was signed at a 2018 summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and then South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nCritics have said the pact weakened Seoul's ability to monitor North Korea while Pyongyang had violated the agreement.\nNorth Korea said on Tuesday it placed its first spy satellite in orbit, drawing international condemnation for violating U.N. resolutions that bar its use of technology applicable to ballistic missile programs.\nSouth Korea has said the North Korean satellite was believed to have entered orbit, but it would take time to assess whether the satellite was operating normally.\nTuesday's launch was the North's third this year after two previous attempts failed, and followed Kim's visit to Russia, during which President Vladimir Putin promised to help the North build satellites.\nSouth Korean officials said the North Korean launch most likely involved Russian technical assistance under a growing partnership that has seen Pyongyang supply Russia with millions of artillery shells.\nRussia and North Korea have denied arms deals but have promised deeper cooperation.

        "text": "\nPANAMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Panama\u2019s Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday that a 20-year concession for a Canadian copper mine that has been the focus of widespread environmental protests was unconstitutional and the president said later a process to close the mine would begin.\nOpponents of the Cobre Panama mine argued it would damage a forested coastal area and threaten water supplies. The announcement of the nine-member court's decision after four days of deliberations set off cheers among a crowd of people waiting outside and waving Panamanian flags.\n\u201cThis is what we had been waiting for,\u201d demonstrator Raisa Banfield said after what she called an agonizing wait. \u201cThe president has to suspend (mine) operations today.\"\nMinera Panama, the local subsidiary of Canada\u2019s First Quantum Minerals, which operates the mine in central Panama, said in a statement that \u201cCobre Panama acknowledges the court\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to affirm our unwavering commitment to regulatory compliance in all aspects of our operations within the country,\u201d the company wrote. \"We will comment further as additional details on the ruling are made public.\u201d\nPanama President Laurentino Cortizo told the nation Tuesday that as soon as his administration formally receives the court's decision it would be published in the official gazette and a process will begin \u201cfor an orderly and safe closure of the mine.\u201d\nThe mine employs thousands and accounts for 3% of Panama\u2019s gross domestic product.\nIn March, Panama\u2019s legislature reached an agreement with First Quantum allowing Minera Panama to continue operating the huge copper mine for at least 20 more years. The open-pit mine was temporarily closed last year when talks between the government and First Quantum broke down over payments the government wanted.\nThe contract, given final approval Oct. 20, allowed the subsidiary to continue operating the mine in a biodiverse jungle on the Atlantic coast west of the capital for the next 20 years, with the possibility of extending for a further 20 years if the site remained productive.\nThe dispute over the mine led to some of Panama's most widespread protests in recent years, including a blockade of the mine\u2019s power plant. Protesters also blocked parts of the Pan American highway, including a stretch near the border with Costa Rica.\nJust before the ruling was announced, they opened the roadway so freight trucks could get through.\nMinera Panama said in a statement earlier this month that small boats had blocked its port in Colon province, preventing supplies from reaching the mine. Naval police reported that a ship carrying coal decided to turn back due to \u201chostility from a group of protesters who from their boats threw rocks and blunt homemade objects\u201d before being dispersed.\nThe protesters, a broad coalition of Panamanians, feared the mine\u2019s impact on nature and especially on the water supply.\nAfter the protests began, the government nearly passed legislation that would have revoked the contract, but it backtracked in a debate in the National Assembly on Nov. 2.\nA court decision that declared the contract unconstitutional was the last opportunity for opponents to get it thrown out.\nThe Canadian government said it respected Tuesday's ruling and was following the contract negotiation closely. In an email, Jean-Pierre J. Godbout, a spokesperson for the government\u2019s Global Affairs Department, said the government \u201cconsistently hopes for an agreed solution that is beneficial to all parties.\u201d\n___\nRob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

Revenues rose 24% at constant exchange rates in the first half.\nGrowth will be driven by the Asia-Pacific region, while sales in the Americas are expected to weaken further, also due to the conversion of some U.S. stores from wholesale to retail, analysts at Barclays said.\n\"The exit rate for the third quarter is likely to have been weaker due to hot weather. Therefore we think comments about the start of October will be more meaningful to assess underlying trends,\" UBS analysts said, adding that the brand momentum is still strong.\nGiven the importance of coats and winter products, Moncler's retail sales are more concentrated in the first and fourth quarters.\n\"The third quarter is less important than others for Moncler, it would be more serious if mild temperatures were recorded in October, November and December,\" Flavio Cereda, co-investment manager luxury brands at GAM, told Reuters.\nHe added that Moncler is certainly less linked to seasonality than in the past, but the DNA of a company founded as an Alpine mountain goods company remains its outerwear.\nMoncler is preparing to face more extreme climate events and increasingly unpredictable weather.\nIn its last conference call in July, Moncler Business Strategy Chief Roberto Eggs said that the group has an offer of light and warm products for both spring/summer and autumn/winter collections.\n\"We are working also on multilayering, which is something that is adding functionality to our outerwear,\" he added.\n($1 = 0.9421 euros)\n(Reporting by Elisa Anzolin; Editing by Keith Weir and Sharon Singleton)",

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Major League Baseball owners are poised to vote this week on whether to allow the Oakland Athletics to move to Las Vegas, amid lingering questions about the team\u2019s proposed new home stadium and where the club would play while the venue is being built.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nRolex, Patek Prices Hit Fresh Two-Year Lows: Subdial Index\nS&P 500 Up 2% as Bets \u2018Fed Is Done\u2019 Sink US Yields: Markets Wrap\nThailand Takes $28 Billion Malacca Strait Bypass Plan to US\nBiden, Xi to Announce China\u2019s Crackdown on Fentanyl Trade\nTrump Insists on \u2018Disclaimer\u2019 Defense Already Tossed in NY Fraud Trial\nThe 30 owners are convening in Arlington, Texas, starting Tuesday for a quarterly meeting, and the team\u2019s prospective move is on the docket. The club needs to win over at least 75% of the other owners to move ahead with the plan to leave Oakland after 55 years in the Bay Area, all in the same ballpark \u2014 the aging Coliseum.\nJeremy Aguero of Applied Analysis, who\u2019s advising the A\u2019s as well as Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo on efforts to build a stadium in Las Vegas, expects the relocation to win approval. So does Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College, in large part because of what he sees as MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s support for the plan. Sports news site the Athletic reported that the owners are expected to clear the move Thursday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve conducted a great amount of due diligence ahead of the vote,\u201d Aguero said in a telephone interview.\nLombardo approved a $380 million public funding package in June for a new $1.5 billion ballpark, about two months after the team announced its decision to buy land in Las Vegas with the intention of building a stadium. The developments set the stage for this week\u2019s vote, and potentially the end of A\u2019s owner John Fisher\u2019s nearly 20-year quest to find a new home for the team.\nRead more: Oakland\u2019s Baseball Future Hangs on a Waterfront Stadium Deal\nNevada\u2019s financing plan ties the proposed stadium site to the location of what is now the Tropicana Las Vegas Casino Resort, near the Las Vegas Strip on land owned by Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc.\nThe funding would become null and void if MLB owners fail to approve the A\u2019s relocation, or if the team\u2019s agreement with Gaming and Leisure falls through and the A\u2019s need to seek another site. A filing last month from Gaming and Leisure shows their pact with the A\u2019s is contingent on MLB clearing the move before Dec. 1.\nStadium Questions\nAs the owners gather, there are some key aspects of the plan that remain up in the air, such as whether the proposed Las Vegas ballpark will be ready before January 2028, the tentative completion date originally set by the A\u2019s.\nAnother issue is that the team hasn\u2019t secured a temporary home field to use before the planned Las Vegas venue is ready. The A\u2019s were supposed to do that before the vote, ESPN reported in September.\nMLB media representatives didn\u2019t respond to phone calls seeking comment.\nErica George, an A\u2019s spokesperson, said \u201cwe are respecting this process and look forward to having more comments after the vote.\u201d\nOne solution would be for the team to extend its lease at the Coliseum for a few years. However, in exchange for an extension past 2024, Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao wants a guarantee from MLB that the city will receive an expansion team should the A\u2019s move to Nevada.\nMeanwhile, Oakland\u2019s city council passed a resolution this month reaffirming the city\u2019s commitment to keeping the team.\nEven if the relocation bid passes, there are still a number of steps \u2013 including a development agreement, lease agreement, non-relocation agreement and community benefits agreement \u2013 that the Las Vegas Stadium Authority still needs to complete before construction on a new ballpark can commence.\n\u201cThis is not done yet and the A\u2019s can still build a stadium in Oakland where we have not only one but in fact two approved sites that could readily accommodate a ballpark,\u201d said Oakland city council member Rebecca Kaplan.\nClark County, the home of Las Vegas, would issue an estimated $120 million of debt to help pay for the new stadium. Revenue generated from a sports and entertainment improvement district encompassing the venue is expected to help repay the bonds. The remainder of the cost, plus any budget overruns, would be privately financed by Fisher, the A\u2019s owner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nTexas Battles Wall Street in Threat to State\u2019s Muni Market\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

That\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s because it\u2019s very difficult as an American citizen.\u201d\n\u201cChina is a long growth story, I just think as an outsider I\u2019m not going to be able to participate as much as I would like,\u201d he said.\nIndia Offers Manufacturing Opportunities (11:50 a.m. SGT)\nVU Technologies Chairwoman Devita Saraf said she\u2019s a strong supporter of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d push.\nWhile India was a bit slow to get in the manufacturing game, there\u2019s still a big opportunity to manufacture in India, she said. \u201cThere is an opportunity to innovate in design with the talent India has in both hardware and software.\u201d\n\u201cWe lost a couple of decades,\u201d Saraf said. \u201cIndia is not a China-plus-one strategy to replace big factories in China.\u201d\nAsia Needs Gas for Cleaner Future (11:30 a.m. SGT)\nThe energy transition in Asia will require more natural gas to ensure power supply as countries shift away from dirtier coal, according to Japan\u2019s top utility. \u201cWe need natural gas, or LNG, to be placed\u201d in the Asian economy, Toshiro Kudama, chief executive officer of Jera Asia Pte Ltd., said during a panel discussion on energy security. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to support the economic growth of this region \u201d with intermittent renewable sources.\nIn Asia, \u201cit\u2019s not very realistic or very practical to transition immediately from coal to renewable energy resources,\u201d said Yao Lixia, a senior fellow at the National University of Singapore. \u201cSo the most immediate solution may be natural gas.\u201d\nThe major lesson of the energy crisis last year is that sustainability took a back seat to fuel affordability and security, said Yngve Slyngstad, managing director of Industry Capital Partners. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine upended energy markets, sending the price of gas and coal surging and making fuel too expensive for some developing nations. Africa is in the midst of ensuring energy security and can\u2019t currently afford to invest more in the transition, said Fikile Z.

Supply chains are shifting to Southeast Asia, Middle East and the Americas.\nHis company has followed the money flow to conduct acquisitions of payment companies in Mexico. Airwallex has also launched in the Middle East and Latin America. It\u2019s been investing in those regions to set up the infrastructure.\n\u201cGeopolitical issues definitely played a very significant role in these changes in the last two years,\u201d said Zhang, adding that over the last two years there has been a \u201cdramatic\u201d turn in global money flows.\nPwC on Better US-China Ties (8:00 a.m. SGT)\nSigns of increasing cooperation between the world\u2019s two largest economies are having a positive impact on auditing, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers International Ltd. Chairman Bob Moritz.\n\u201cThe US-China relationship has actually brought it to a head where you have access to information for regulators to inspect,\u201d he told Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of the forum. \u201cIt\u2019s going to allow for the inspections to happen, so that tension has decreased quite a bit.\u201d\nThe US audit watchdog has started auditing some firms after Washington and Beijing struck a deal last year following a long-running dispute over U.S.-listed Chinese firms\u2019 auditing compliance. Authorities in China were reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting companies on national security concerns.\nThe World Must Tread Carefully (8 p.m. SGT Wednesday)\nSingapore\u2019s Lee said China isn\u2019t \u201ctrigger happy\u201d in its aim to take over self-governing Taiwan, which it views as its territory. \u201cThey would like Taiwan to be part of \u2018one China,\u2019\u201d but aren\u2019t sure how to make it happen, he said. Unless Beijing is provoked, the world isn\u2019t \u201cgoing to wake up one day and find that they\u2019ve decided to launch D-Day.\u201d\nIn wide-ranging remarks, Lee said there\u2019s no alternative to a two-state solution to ensure peace between Israelis and Palestinians. A one-state solution would mean that \u201cone side or the other has to be squeezed out and that is unimaginable.\u201d He spoke amid global concern about the civilian toll from the Israel-Hamas war, which broke out after Hamas killed more than 1,400 Israelis and took around 240 hostage in a surprise attack. Hamas is designated a terrorist group by the US and European Union.\nOn AI, Lee said that more knowledge and experience of the technology is needed. It\u2019s key to understand that \u201cthe pitfalls are so that we can make smart decisions to regulate it as we go along,\u201d he said, noting that tech people generally know more about AI than do governments.\nThe New Economy Forum is being organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Such Western algorithms, he said, essentially thought Russia did not exist.\n\"Of course, the monopoly and domination of such systems, such alien systems is unacceptable and dangerous,\" he said.\nChina and the United States are far ahead of other countries when it comes to AI research, according to most rankings, though a second tier of European countries as well as India, Russia, Israel, South Korea and Japan also figure in the rankings.\nFor Russia, though, the war in Ukraine and efforts to mobilise combatants triggered an outflow of large numbers of educated Russians while Western sanctions have cut international cooperation with AI powerhouses in the West.\n\"In all spheres of our life, humanity is beginning a new chapter of its existence,\" Putin said of AI, adding that Russia needed to up its game on AI both in ambitions and execution.\n\"In the very near future, as one of the first steps, a presidential decree will be signed and a new version of the national strategy for the development of artificial intelligence will be approved,\" Putin told the conference.\nPutin said the new strategy would make significant changes, including \"expanding fundamental and applied research in the field of generative artificial intelligence and large language models\".\nRussian researchers, he said, should be given better access to supercomputers - which he said needed to be boosted by orders of magnitude - while top level Russian scientific education about AI needed to be improved.\nRussia, he said, would have to change laws, boost international cooperation, and ensure much more investment for the development of AI.\nPutin hailed Sberbank and Yandex for developing their own generative AI and language models - which he said needed to be developed further and applied to sectors of the economy.\nGref is transforming Sberbank, once known as a staid former Soviet savings bank where people queued for hours to pay bills, overseeing investments in AI, cloud services, big data and smart devices. He told Putin in June that Sberbank was making around $3 billion annually from $1 billion in AI investments.\n(Reporting by Guy FaulconbridgeEditing by Gareth Jones and Mark Potter)",

Its best-known game is \"Marvel Snap\", an online card game that amassed a cult following but was not a commercial hit.\nOther titles include action games \"One Piece: The Voyage\" and \"Crystal of Atland\".\nNuverse came into focus again in 2021 when ByteDance formalised its status as one of its six business units under a broader structural overhaul.\nTo build up production capacity, Nuverse acquired external studios including C4games in 2021.\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Brenda Goh and Christopher Cushing)",

        "text": "\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Autoworkers at the first Ford factory to go on strike have voted overwhelmingly in favor of a tentative contract agreement reached with the company.\nMembers of Local 900 at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, west of Detroit voted 82% in favor of the four year-and-eight month deal, the United Auto Workers union said in a statement Thursday. The union said 3,097 workers voted in favor and 683 were against the contract.\nProduction workers voted 81% to ratify the deal, while skilled trades workers voted 90% in favor. Voting by Ford's 57,000 union members will continue through Nov. 17.\nWorkers went on strike at the assembly plant Sept. 15 after the union's contract with Ford expired. They remained on the picket lines until Oct. 25, when the union announced the tentative deal with Ford.\nLocal union leaders from across the country at Jeep maker Stellantis voted unanimously on Thursday to send the contract to members for a vote. General Motors local leaders will meet on Friday. Dates for member voting at GM or Stellantis were not yet clear.\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who follows labor issues, said the vote at the Ford factory is a positive sign for the union.\n\u201cThese workers are deeply in the know about the overall situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that they responded to it with such high levels of approval it is perhaps reflective of how the broader workforce represented by the UAW feels about this contract.\u201d\nMasters says union officials still have to make their cases to the membership, but \u201ccertainly this would appear to be a harbinger of good news.\u201d\nThe deals with all three companies are generally the same, although there are some differences. All give workers 25% general pay raises with 11% upon ratification. With cost of living pay, the raises will exceed 30% by the time the contracts end on April 30, 2028. Workers hired after 2009 without defined benefit pensions will get 10% annual company contributions to 401(k) plans, and they'll get $5,000 ratification bonuses.\nOn Thursday night, Fain and Vice President Rich Boyer told workers in an online presentation that the union\u2019s strikes got every last dime possible out of Stellantis.\nThe top assembly plant wage at the company will go from $31.77 per hour to $42.24 by the end of the contract, Boyer said.\nThe union said it saved jobs at a plant in Belvidere, Illinois, that Stellantis wanted to close. Plus, workers at a new joint-venture electric vehicle battery factory planned for Belvidere will be Stellantis employees and leased to the joint venture, Fain said.\nWorkers at the plant will be under the UAW national contract and will make over $30 per hour by the end of the contract, with the chance to bargain for more later, Fain said.\nFain said terrified auto executives at nonunion plants are raising wages, citing an increase this week at Toyota factories in an effort to keep the UAW from organizing their plants.\n\u201cEven though you're not yet members of our union,\" Fain said to Toyota workers, \"that pay raise Toyota is giving you is the UAW bump. UAW, that stands for \u2018You Are Welcome.\u2019\"\nUAW workers began their strikes with targeted walkouts at all three automakers that escalated during a six-week period in an effort to pressure the companies into a deal. GM was the last company to settle early Sunday morning.\nAt its peak 46,000 union members had gone on strike at eight assembly plants and 38 parts warehouses across the nation. The union has about 146,000 members at all three of the Detroit auto companies.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that 82% of workers at Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant voted in favor of the tentative contract agreement, not 81%.",

        "text": "\nBy Stefania Spezzati and Karin Strohecker\nLONDON (Reuters) - Software firm SUSE, whose clients include Microsoft and BMW, told investors in January it was tightening its scrutiny of commercial deals.\nSUSE, whose software helps large companies run servers, said in its annual report for 2022 that to ensure sales were \"appropriately authorized\" it had created a deal desk \u2013 a department commonly used by software businesses to vet commercial and contractual terms.\nFounded in 1992, SUSE had been publicly traded since 2021 and creating a deal desk aligned it with other listed companies in the sector.\n\"SUSE may enter into high-risk or commercially inappropriate deals if it does not exercise effective control over the Sales organization,\" it said in the report. The company noted that \"'Commercial governance' is a newly identified risk this year\" and a heatmap in the report ranked the risk as \"possible\" and its impact on the business as \"high\".\nReuters wasn't able to establish what prompted that warning.\nNine company documents seen by Reuters relating to two of SUSE's recent sales, as well as interviews with three people with knowledge of the transactions, shed light on some examples of the company's decision-making as it has tried to tighten commercial controls.\nLawyers for SUSE said in a letter to Reuters on Sept. 22 that the creation of the deal desk was \"nothing more than a natural governance maturity exercise, undertaken by a scaling and young listed business\".\nSUSE's majority shareholder, EQT, in August offered to take the software company private after it slashed sales targets this year, its CEO and CFO departed, and its shares plunged. SUSE held an extraordinary meeting on Nov. 13 at which shareholders approved to delist the stock from the exchange.\n\"Execution challenges and several changes during the past twelve months have impacted SUSE's operating performance and market valuation,\" EQT said in a statement on the public offer in August. It added that leaving the public stock market would ease pressure from \"short-term demands\" on the new management. EQT declined to comment for this article.\nIts offer for SUSE shares, which were traded in Frankfurt, valued SUSE at 2.72 billion euros ($3 billion), some 47% below the level of the 2021 IPO. SUSE shares last traded at 10.89 euros on Nov. 13 before the delisting, according to the exchange Deutsche Boerse, 64% below its IPO price.\nSUSE's revenue in the financial year to October 31, 2022 was $653 million. Its 2022 annual report, filed on January 19, said the deal desk should review any deals greater than $500,000. Lawyers for SUSE's former CEO Melissa Di Donato, who stood down on March 21, told Reuters the deal desk was created after a joint decision by the executive team and the company's board.\nAccording to four documents reviewed by Reuters and two of the people with knowledge of the situation, Di Donato greenlighted the commercial terms of a roughly $1.4 million sale to South African utility Eskom in late January, bypassing the deal desk's scrutiny in order to speed the process, less than two weeks after SUSE told investors the desk would help to improve controls.\nOn January 30, after commercial terms of the Eskom deal had been agreed, a senior SUSE executive said in an email to other company officials that the terms had not been submitted to the deal desk.\nIn late February, an executive told colleagues in an email that the sale had not been scrutinized by the deal desk before being agreed but the team would review the terms to familiarize itself with the transaction, according to the documents and two people with knowledge of the transaction.\nThe deal would still be logged into SUSE's systems as approved by Di Donato without sign-off from the deal desk, the executive said. Reuters could not determine if this was done. There was no suggestion in the documents reviewed by the news agency of any problematic issues that arose from the terms of the deal.\nA lawyer for Di Donato said in the letter to Reuters that it was \"highly misleading\" to suggest she had reached the Eskom agreement without submitting it for the deal desk's approval: \"the deal desk was aware of the deal. Nothing was skipped.\" SUSE lawyers didn't address directly whether approval from the deal desk had been skipped on the Eskom transaction.\nA spokesperson for Eskom did not comment on SUSE's due diligence but said that \"Eskom's established processes and governance structures were adhered to during this procurement.\"\nDISCOUNTED DEAL\nAs part of the new risks identified in the annual report, SUSE warned in January that: \"quarter-end pressure may exacerbate the risk as sales staff try to get deals over the line.\"\nThe documents reviewed by Reuters show the efforts SUSE made to clinch one deal: in December 2022 SUSE discounted a sale to Bank of New York Mellon by more than 90% from the listed price.\nSUSE sales growth was slowing at the time. Di Donato agreed to offer BNY Mellon the discount on a package of services originally listed at several million dollars, according to emails and a person familiar with the transaction. Reuters could not determine what SUSE's original offer was.\nUnder the discounted deal, BNY Mellon was offered a one-year package that included SUSE's Platinum service and 10,000 'nodes', according to the documents and one of the people.\nLawyers for Di Donato said \"the scope, the services and the size of the BNY Mellon deal changed from what was originally on offer and, therefore, the final price changed accordingly.\" Di Donato's lawyer added \"it was not part of her responsibilities as the CEO of SUSE to track discounts on deals,\" and \"the discount was approved in collaboration with others\".\nA spokesperson for BNY Mellon declined to comment on the deal.\nLawyers for SUSE did not comment on the terms of the deal, saying it was confidential. Reuters could not determine if the deal was vetted by the deal desk nor how many deals have been going through the unit.\nWithout referring to SUSE specifically, Christian Strenger, director of the Corporate Governance Institute (CGI) at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, said that software-related services companies, in particular, have pressure to meet quarterly and year-end performance targets as they often rely on large individual sales.\nDi Donato's lawyers said that quarter-end pressures affected all companies: \"Our client has never forced a sales team to close a deal that was not good for the business.\"\nSUSE and Reuters parent company, Thomson Reuters, are involved in litigation over the use of SUSE software products. SUSE claims that Thomson Reuters breached the terms that allegedly governed its use of SUSE software products.\n($1 = 0.9096 euros)\n(Reporting by Karin Strohecker and Stefania Spezzati; Additional reporting by Emma-Victoria Farr; Editing by Elisa Martinuzzi and Daniel Flynn)",

Scholz's government has pledged to double support for Kyiv to 8 billion euros ($8.76 billion) next year.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock later told a NATO meeting in Brussels that Germany would bring its defence spending up to the alliance's target of 2% of gross domestic product next year.\n'ROLE MODEL'\nCDU leader Friedrich Merz accused Scholz's government of a brazen attempt to circumvent borrowing rules and said its behaviour risked undermining the European Union's wider fiscal reforms in upcoming negotiations.\n\"If the dams burst in Germany, they will also not hold in all other countries in the currency union,\" Merz said. \"Germany has a function as a role model there.\"\nGermany had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 65% in 2022, compared with 117% for France, 148% for Italy and 116% for Spain, OECD data show.\nHendrik Wuest, CDU premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said the government had ruined Germany's reputation as an anchor of stability in just two years. \"The international damage is huge,\" he told the Rheinische Post newspaper.\nMemories of how frugality paved the way for postwar reconstruction and how costly it was to re-integrate indebted ex-communist East Germany have shaped a uniquely debt-averse political culture.\nIn order to keep supporting industry, Finance Minister Christian Lindner has ruled out tax rises and said savings would have to be found elsewhere, backed up by potentially difficult welfare reforms.\n\"We had no room for manouevre even before the ruling,\" Christoph Landscheidt, head of the local government association in North Rhine-Westphalia, told the Rheinische Post. \"We've never before had such a pile-up of crises, all placing massive demands on local government budgets.\"\nCoalition party leaders are due to meet on Wednesday evening to thrash out a path to the 2024 budget. Their popularity has sagged during a period of weak economic performance, rising inflation and higher interest rates.\nBut offering some reprieve, a new survey by Forsa suggested only just over a third of Germans believe a CDU-led government could handle the budget crisis better than the ruling coalition, while 59% did not.\n($1 = 0.9134 euros) (Reporting by Andreas Rinke, Christian Kraemer, Miranda Murray, Rachel More, Maria Martinez, Alex Ratz; Writing by Matthias Williams and Thomas Escritt; editing by Kirsti Knolle, Bernadette Baum, Alex Richardson and Tomasz Janowski)",

The profit potential from this trade is staggering,\" trader Dave Reiter with Reiter Capital Investments LLC said on X, formerly Twitter, referring to the position some investors built on the contract.\n\"OJ is very thinly traded. Not extremely hard to move the market like it is with corn or soybeans,\" said Darin Fessler, SVP, Market Strategist at Lakefront Futures & Options.\nThe January OJ position, for example, had an open interest of 8,111 lots at the end of trading on Monday. As a comparison, the most traded contract among the soft commodities, ICE's raw sugar, had over 435,000 lots in open interest.\nBeyond the speculative game, however, fundamentals are extremely positive, with negative weather and a bacterial disease called greening having reduced production in the three main growers Mexico, U.S. and Brazil. Florida's production has also been hit by hurricanes in recent years.\nIbiapaba Netto, executive director at CitrusBR, the association representing Brazilian juice producers, said that a reversal of the current tight supply situation would take time, and is not certain to happen.\nBrazil has a 75% share of the global orange juice trade.\nNetto said fruit producers are afraid to invest to expand orchards fearing the greening disease.\n\"Our last large crop was five years ago.

It\u2019s part of a network of plants that pass water and nutrients to each other, even allowing trees to \u201ccommunicate,\u201d according to the National Forest Foundation.\nMushrooms, the fairytale home of garden gnomes, are a byproduct that grows on the surface.\nResearchers are leveraging the growth properties of the organism to create mycocrete, an ingenious paste that, when dried, is \u201cstronger and more versatile\u201d than other fungi biomaterials.\n\u201cOur ambition is to transform the look, feel and wellbeing of architectural spaces using mycelium in combination with biobased materials such as wool, sawdust, and cellulose,\u201d Newcastle\u2019s Dr. Jane Scott said in a university report.\nThe process is quite the biology experiment. Scientists take mycelium spores and mix them with materials the spores can devour and grow on, including grains.\nThis mixture is put into a mold and placed in a room that might resemble your basement right now \u2014 warm, dark, and humid. The mycelium grows to form and is dried, creating a building material that could be a cleaner fill-in for foam, timber, or plastic, per Newcastle research.\nIn this innovation, the experts have improved the process by using flexible, tube-shaped knitted molds, which are hung from a frame. This allows for more oxygen to enter, helping to create what the experts call mycocrete, CleanTechnica reported.\nThe team proved the concept through a unique build called BioKnit, which was tested for strength, outperforming past samples. It\u2019s a \u201ccomplex freestanding dome constructed in a single piece without [joints] that could prove to be weak points, thanks to the flexible knitted form,\u201d according to Newcastle experts.\nIt looks sort of like a birdcage. A university photo shows two people sitting inside it.\nIf this fungus can prove versatile enough to replace concrete in even a portion of our buildings, the results could be impactful. Princeton University reported that concrete is the \u201cmost consumed\u201d product on Earth, not counting water. The concrete industry contributes 4.4 billion tons of air pollution a year, per Princeton.\nThe experts must create the right mycelium mix for buildings, before it goes mainstream.\nIt\u2019s \u201ca significant result, and a step toward the use of mycelium and textile biohybrids within construction,\u201d Scott said in the university report.\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

        "text": "\nBy Paul Sandle, Martin Coulter\nBLETCHLEY PARK, England (Reuters) -China agreed to work with the United States, European Union and other countries to collectively manage the risk from artificial intelligence at a British summit on Wednesday aimed at charting a safe way forward for the rapidly evolving technology.\nSome tech executives and political leaders have warned the rapid development of AI poses an existential threat to the world if not controlled, sparking a race by governments and international institutions to design safeguards and regulation.\nIn a first for Western efforts to manage its safe development, a Chinese vice minister joined U.S. and EU leaders and tech bosses such as Elon Musk and ChatGPT's Sam Altman at Bletchley Park, home of Britain's World War Two code-breakers.\nMore than 25 countries present, including the United States and China, as well as the EU, signed a \"Bletchley Declaration\" saying countries needed to work together and establish a common approach on oversight.\nThe declaration set out a two-pronged agenda focused on identifying risks of shared concern and building scientific understanding of them, while also developing cross-country policies to mitigate them.\nWu Zhaohui, China's vice minister of science and technology, told the opening session of the two-day summit that Beijing was ready to increase collaboration on AI safety to help build an international \"governance framework\".\n\"Countries regardless of their size and scale have equal rights to develop and use AI,\" he said.\nFears about the impact AI could have on economies and society took off in November last year when Microsoft-backed OpenAI made ChatGPT available to the public.\nUsing natural language processing tools to create human-like dialogue, it has stoked fears, including among some AI pioneers, that machines could in time achieve greater intelligence than humans, leading to unlimited, unintended consequences.\nGovernments and officials are now trying to chart a way forward alongside AI companies which fear being weighed down by regulation before the technology reaches its full potential.\n\"I don't know what necessarily the fair rules are, but you've got to start with insight before you do oversight,\" the billionaire Musk told reporters, adding that a \"third-party referee\" could be used to sound the alarm when risks develop.\nWhile the European Union has focused its AI oversight on data privacy and surveillance and their potential impact on human rights, the British summit is looking at so-called existential risks from highly capable general-purpose models called \"frontier AI\".\nMustafa Suleyman, the cofounder of Google Deepmind, told reporters he did not think current AI frontier models posed any \"significant catastrophic harms\" but said it made sense to plan ahead as the industry trains ever larger models.\nCODE-BREAKER VENUE\nThe summit is the brainchild of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who wants to carve out a post-Brexit role for his country as an intermediary between the economic blocs of the United States, China and the EU.\nBritish digital minister Michelle Donelan said it was an achievement just to get so many key players in one room. She announced two further AI Safety Summits, one to be held in South Korea in six months and another in France six months after that.\n\"For the first time, we now have countries agreeing that we need to look not just independently but collectively at the risk around frontier AI,\" Donelan told reporters.\nJust as tech companies compete for dominance in AI, governments are jostling to lead the way on regulation.\nChina is a key participant at the summit, given the country's role in developing AI. But some British lawmakers have questioned whether it should be there given the low level of trust between Beijing, Washington and many European capitals when it comes to Chinese involvement in technology.\nThe United States made clear on the eve of the summit that the call to Beijing had very much come from Britain, with its Ambassador to London, Jane Hartley, telling Reuters: \"This is the UK invitation, this is not the U.S.\"\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's decision to give a speech in London on Wednesday about her government's response to AI, and hold some meetings with attendees away from the summit, meaning they may have to leave early, also raised some eyebrows.\nSachin Dev Duggal, founder of London-based AI firm Builder.ai said it risked undermining the event's core focus, while some lawmakers from Sunak's Conservative Party suggested Washington was trying to overshadow his summit.\nBritish officials denied that, saying they wanted as many voices as possible.\nJust days after U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order on AI, his government used the British summit to announce it would launch a U.S. AI Safety Institute.\nHarris will meet Sunak later on Wednesday, including for dinner, and attend the summit's second day on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Paul Sandle, Martin Coulter, William James, Sachin Ravikumar; writing by Kate HoltonEditing by Mark Potter, Elizabeth Piper and Catherine Evans)",

Expectations for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points have grown to more than 50% at the May 2024 meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\nMarkets will look for more clarity on the Fed's intentions from officials speaking later in the week, including Chair Jerome Powell, and voting members such as New York Fed chief John Williams and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan.\n\"Unless something in the economic data prompts it, you won't see them change their tone,\" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.\nExpectations the Fed was likely done with rate hikes sent the S&P 500 up 5.85% last week and the Nasdaq up 6.61%, their biggest weekly jumps since November 2022.\n\"Whatever that buying force was that sort of went rampant on Friday is not around today and so a lot of these names are drifting back down, and yields are a little higher,\" said Massocca.\nMeanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note , which slid to five-week lows on Friday, reversed course to reach a high near 4.67% on Monday, ahead of this week's Treasury auction of about $112 billion in three-year and 10-year notes, as well as 30-year bonds.\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 8.71 points, or 0.20%, to end at 4,367.05 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 42.12 points, or 0.31%, to 13,518.78.

        "text": "\nBy Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Bond investors are pricing in imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts by the first half of next year, as signs of slowing U.S. economic growth and easing inflation became more evident.\nWhile a weakening growth outlook is likely an important factor in keeping the U.S. central bank from raising rates, progress on the inflation front could determine when it will pivot toward monetary policy easing.\nThe release on Thursday of the latest U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, could mark another step closer to that looming policy shift.\nThe PCE price index was unchanged in October after climbing 0.4% in September. In the 12 months through October, it rose 3.0%, the smallest year-on-year gain since March 2021 and a sharp drop from the 3.4% reading in September.\n\"The Fed is on hold, and (this report) gives them more comfort in staying on hold. What they're doing is working,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager, Dakota Wealth Management in Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\"The data is trending in the direction that the Fed wants to see,\" Pavlik said. \"A 25- to 50 basis-point cut before the end of the summer 2024 would make sense as the economy slows down, for the Fed to fine tune how their policy tools are working.\"\nTraders' confidence was reinforced earlier this week when Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a hawkish policymaker, flagged a possible rate cut in the months ahead.\nMarkets will be looking to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Friday at Spelman College in Atlanta to see whether he doubles down on Waller's comments or pushes back.\nHere is how Fed policy expectations are playing out in different corners of the bond and money markets:\nFED FUNDS FUTURES\nFederal funds futures are the most straightforward measure of determining of where traders believe the U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate will be in the future. That market has priced in about a 45% chance of a rate cut at the March 19-20, 2024 meeting, rising to about a 75% probability at the April 30-May 1 meeting, the CME FedWatch Tool showed on Thursday. Overall, the rates market sees a roughly 100 basis points (bps) of cuts by the end of 2024, according to LSEG data.\nYIELD CURVE\nThe current yield curve measuring the gap between yields on U.S. two-year and 10-year Treasury notes has narrowed its inversion for the past several weeks. An inversion of this part of the curve is viewed by many as a reliable signal that a recession is likely to follow in one to two years.\nBut the yield curve has been reducing its inversion as investors start to price in the end of the Fed's tightening cycle. It was last at minus 38.50 bps.\nMarket participants referred to the yield curve's move in the last few weeks as a \"bull steepener,\" a scenario in which short-term yields are falling faster than long-term ones. This often happens when the Fed is expected to cut interest rates, analysts said.\nSOFR FUTURES\nBond investors also look to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) futures to gauge expectations of Fed rate moves. The March 2024 SOFR futures have priced in a 50% chance of a 25 basis-point cut at the March meeting.\nThe June 2024 SOFR futures have priced at least one Fed cut, while the probability of two 25-basis-point rate reductions was at 76%.\nSOFR, a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, replaced the prior benchmark rate, Libor, on June 30 after a rate-fixing scandal by bankers at several major financial institutions came to light in 2012. It's now the backbone of U.S. corporate borrowing.\nOIS FORWARDS\nThe overnight index swap (OIS) forwards market, another corner of the fixed income market that shows traders' rate expectations, is also pricing in rate cuts starting in March.\nAn OIS transaction involves exchanging an overnight rate such as the federal funds rate for a fixed one. For instance, in a U.S. two-year OIS transaction, one party receives a fixed two-year rate in exchange for paying the fed funds rate daily over the next two years.\nThe three-month by six-month OIS forward is factoring more than a 40% chance of a 25-basis-point cut by the Fed's March meeting, LSEG data showed. The longer-dated six-month by nine-month OIS showed 100% odds of at least one rate cut by June, while the chances of two rate cuts by the middle of next year are at 78%.\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Stephen Culp; Editing by Alden Bentley and Paul Simao)",

        "text": "\n(Adds White House readout of Sullivan-Milei meeting in paragraph 4)\nBy Jason Lange and Rodrigo Campos\nWASHINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Argentina's president-elect Javier Milei met on Tuesday with top U.S. officials in Washington and his economic team huddled with IMF officers as he seeks to formulate a plan to reshape the country's foreign policy and lead its economy out of crisis.\nMilei told reporters as he left the White House that his meeting had been \"excellent.\" Among those in attendance were national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council's senior director for the Western Hemisphere.\n\"We talked about the economic and social conditions in Argentina at the moment,\" Milei said in brief comments before he was whisked off in his official car. Milei aligned himself with Western values, his office later said.\nThe White House said Sullivan and Milei had discussed during their meeting the importance of building on a strong bilateral relationship on economic issues and shared priorities such as investment in clean energy and technology.\nMilei, a far-right libertarian who takes office on Dec. 10, won election this month pledging radical reforms such as dollarization and \"shock\" austerity to fix Argentina's economy. Inflation is near 150%, foreign currency reserves are in the red and a recession is looming.\nHis foreign policy, meanwhile, is unabashedly pro-United States and pro-Israel, with a cooler stance on top trade partners Brazil and China.\n\"Milei is a unicorn, the leader of a major Latin American economy who is ostentatiously pro-American,\" said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America program at Washington-based think-tank the Wilson Center.\nWhile Milei's incoming team has looked to moderate earlier criticism of China and Brazil's leftist government, the U.S. trip ahead of his inauguration underscores his priorities.\nHe has also pledged not to join the China-led BRICS trade group. That's a sharp change in approach from outgoing center-left President Alberto Fernandez, who visited Moscow as Vladimir Putin was readying his invasion of Ukraine in February last year and recently returned from a visit to Beijing.\nTHE $44 BILLION QUESTION\nMilei also needs to get the country's $44 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund back on track, with support from the U.S. - the IMF's largest shareholder - key to any revamp.\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said earlier on Tuesday that she would meet Milei at the lender's headquarters, but the meeting did not happen. The IMF did not respond to a request for comment on the missed meeting.\nEconomic advisors to Milei, Nicol\u00e1s Posse and Luis Caputo, met with the IMF's No. 2 Gita Gopinath and other fund officials, the fund said separately.\n\"They discussed the country's complex challenges and plans for urgently strengthening stability and setting the basis for more sustainable growth,\" the IMF said in a statement.\nA U.S. Treasury official confirmed that Milei's advisors met with Treasury officials to discuss the president-elect's economic agenda, but declined to provide details. The Treasury manages the dominant U.S. shareholding in the IMF.\nArgentina is by far the largest global debtor to the Washington-based lender but its program has ran off the tracks, and the IMF has been losing patience. The program is used mostly to pay the Fund back for a failed $57 billion program from 2018.\nDuring his campaign Milei vowed to dollarize South America's second-largest economy, though he seems to have put that on the back burner while he looks to overturn a deep fiscal deficit and tamp down inflation. He has stuck, however, to pledges that he will radically change the mandate of the central bank.\nThe IMF has said in the past that dollarization is not a substitute for sound macroeconomic policy. Lack of an orthodox policy framework under the current administration and a sharp increase in central bank-financed spending in the run-up to the presidential election further hurt the Argentine economy.\nMilei and IMF officials had a first virtual meeting on Friday, which Georgieva called a \"very constructive engagement\".\nMilei's office said the meeting with the IMF was part of protocol to explain the incoming team's economic plan and not in search for more financing.\nGeorgieva, however, told Reuters in an interview that the IMF was \"very keen\" to support Argentina and the country could be a candidate to receive a relatively small amount of extra financing through a trust for middle-income countries.

That process has gradually grown more arduous, with rejections increasingly common, because the UAE is showing less appetite for sanctions-related risk and pushing to get off the so-called gray list, according to more than half a dozen business owners and consultants interviewed by Bloomberg, who asked not to be identified as such information isn\u2019t public.\nMoney transfers \u2014 whether for companies repatriating funds to Russia or moving cash to a third country \u2014 have also been subject to greater oversight and now take more time, the people said. Some banks are demanding more documentation, and at times blocking funds, while seeking justification for the transfer or questioning the origin of the money, they said.\nIn the initial aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, UAE officials hewed to policies that attracted a surge of inflows from high net worth individuals. In recent months, officials have looked to close perceived gaps in sanctions compliance, the people said, as the UAE seeks to be removed from a list of jurisdictions subject to more oversight maintained by the Financial Action Task Force, a group that aims to combat global money laundering.\nIn the meantime, the US, UK and European Union have ramped up pressure on Emirati officials to tackle illicit flows and close channels used by Moscow to skirt trade sanctions and finance the Kremlin\u2019s war machine. This month, the Biden administration targeted several UAE-based shipping firms, part of a crackdown on non-compliance with its oil price cap.\n\u201cIn terms of financial compliance, it has become much more difficult to be Russian in the UAE, and the situation is getting tougher,\u201d said Daria Nevskaya, a Dubai-based lawyer who consults with clients on cross-border deals and bank accounts. \u201cSome banks that previously had been accepting payments from Russia have put a stop to such transactions now.\u201d\nIn response to questions from Bloomberg, a UAE official said the country takes it role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system extremely seriously. \u201cThe increased resources and expertise we have put in place underpin the UAE\u2019s continued commitment to combating economic crime and disrupting illicit networks, both at home and abroad,\u201d the official said.\nRead more: EU Says UAE to Curb Key Exports to Russia Used in War in Ukraine\nAs part of the FATF proceedings, UAE banks are requesting more information from current and prospective clients, including specific checks related to sanctions lists, Thani Al Zeyoudi, the country\u2019s minister of state for foreign trade, told Bloomberg on Tuesday.\nWhile that\u2019s true for clients of every nationality, the situation can be particularly acute for Russians because of the volume of country-specific sanctions, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\u201cThe UAE has been very good at usually doing just about enough to escape serious censure while also being as open to business from all sides as they can,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. \u201cMore due diligence and cutting links with clear sanctions evaders will be enough to avoid any escalation with the US.\u201d\nThe policy shift has hit smaller businesses particularly hard because of lenders\u2019 risk-reward calculations, according to Michael Malinovskiy, a partner at Lecap law firm.\nSome larger businesses are now weighing alternatives.\nThe UAE\u2019s crackdown on illicit activities in its bullion market and US measures against Russia\u2019s top gold miners led to a shift in trading from Dubai to Hong Kong since April, two people involved in the industry said. More rigorous oversight of bank transfers and a mandatory government database for monitoring cash payments have increased hurdles for Russian exporters in the UAE, people familiar with the matter said.\nAnother of Russia\u2019s biggest mining companies, which has sanctioned shareholders, has been struggling to open a bank account for months, two people familiar with the situation said.\nGazprombank, which has escaped the strictest restrictions due to its role in commodities trading, had one of its correspondent accounts closed by Dubai-based bank Mashreq, a person with direct knowledge of the situation said, declining to be identified as the information isn\u2019t public. The lender has accounts at two other UAE banks for now, the person said, adding that he thinks Dubai banks are closing for Russian money.\nGazprombank\u2019s media relations staff and Mashreq didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment.\nTo be sure, the UAE is still a favored hub for many of Russia\u2019s biggest unsanctioned companies. United Co. Rusal International PJSC is shifting its global aluminum trading headquarters to Dubai from Switzerland, while EuroChem Group AG, one of the country\u2019s biggest fertilizer producers, has run its trading operations through Dubai for more than a year. The Uralchem-Uralkali fertilizer group has had its international trading unit based in Dubai\u2019s DMCC free trade zone since 2021.\nStill, closer scrutiny from UAE authorities is pushing some mid-size businesses to move to neighboring Gulf countries, such as Oman or Bahrain, which aren\u2019t under the US government\u2019s spotlight, the people said.\n\u201cThe UAE still is a very useful hub to have for Russia, notably the rich elites around Putin,\u201d Hertog said. \u201cRussia probably needs the UAE more than the other way around at this point, but there is still need for Russian cooperation vis-a-vis Iran, Syria, Libya and other regional hot spots.\u201d\n--With assistance from Abeer Abu Omar.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

For buyers on a budget, there were colorful landscapes being offered for less than $100.\nThe dealer hawking the art made no effort to disguise who produced the pieces, despite stiff U.N. sanctions prohibiting the sale of such goods: \u201cThey were painted over there,\" the dealer said, \u201cin North Korea.\u201d\nThe dealer, who had salt-and-pepper hair and refused to divulge his name, was a representative of an art gallery that trumpets itself as China\u2019s premier seller of North Korean art. The gallery, The Paintings Say Arirang, also operates a studio for North Korean artists in the outskirts of Beijing.\nHoused in a fenced and heavily surveilled compound, the North Koreans paint glorified, idyllic visions of life back home. For the right price, the Arirang studio says, the artists will render \u201cexquisite\" portraits at \u201cunimaginable prices.\"\nThe gallery's existence and conspicuous sales tactics, experts say, highlight China\u2019s lax enforcement of U.N. sanctions targeting North Korea to stymie Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program. A. The U.N. has sanctioned a long list of North Korean goods, including arms, coal and art. The U.N. has also sought to block North Koreans from working overseas in the hopes of preventing North Korea from garnishing the wages of such laborers to fund its nuclear program. U.N. report in March singled out Arirang for selling North Korean art and hosting North Korean artists in apparent violation of sanctions.\nChina has a long history of rebuffing efforts by the U.N. to rein in such suspected sanctions violators, and last year vetoed a U.N. resolution that would have toughened such restrictions. The U.N. reported that Arirang did not respond to requests for information.\nArirang was not hard for the U.N. to find. That's because the gallery is actively seeking to tap a niche audience drawn to the unique, socialist realist style of North Korean artists.\nArirang was founded by Jin Zhe, an ethnic Korean and art lover born in China near the North Korean border, according to posts written by Jin on Arirang\u2019s website. The son of a prominent painter, Jin spent years at a Chinese state-run radio station before a trip to Pyongyang instilled a taste for North Korean art. Jin, Arirang\u2019s director, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nAn Arirang employee told The AP by phone that the studio was in operation and offered a tour of the complex. She also said the studio was selling customized portraits by its North Korean artists. The employee, a woman identifying herself as surnamed Shen, changed her story a few days later, saying the base wasn\u2019t in operation because \u201cbusiness is bad.\u201d\nWhen AP journalists visited the \u201cpainting base,\u201d guards turned them away.\nIn lengthy posts on Chinese chat application WeChat, the art gallery expounds at length on the beauty rendered by North Korean artists because they are free from the fetters of the \u201cmarket economy.\u201d\n\u201cThey do not compare who is richer than the other, but simply focus on pure aesthetics,\u201d Arirang wrote on WeChat. \u201cThey regard the pursuit of art as a mission of spiritual civilization,\u201d not vulgar commodification.\nSuch art is exceptionally valuable, Arirang said, \u201cbecause of its superb realistic skills, high-cost performance, high collection value and other advantages.\u201d\nIn most countries, art is seen as a form of self-expression. But in North Korea it is strictly regulated. Artists work directly for North Korea\u2019s propaganda authorities, and their mission is to create art glorifying the state and its socialist, nationalist ideology.\nTheir work also provides income for the North Korean state.\n\u201cAll artists in North Korea are slaves to the Party,\u201d said Song Byeok, a dissident artist who painted propaganda posters in North Korea until he fled to the South two decades ago. \u201cNorth Korean art is a tool of the Kim family, with no identity of its own.\u201d\nPosts on Arirang provide glimpses of the artists\u2019 lives in China. In one photo, they raise glasses of beer around sizzling barbecue. Others show them playing ping pong or visiting historic monuments and bustling market streets.\nNearly a thousand paintings had been rendered in Arirang\u2019s \u201cpainting base,\u201d Jin wrote wrote on WeChat. The artists work hard, often refusing breaks, the gallery\u2019s director added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very relaxing, no worries,\u201d Jin recounted one artist saying.\nAnother told Jin that they can\u2019t sleep until they were done, Jin said.\nBG Muhn, an expert in North Korean art at Georgetown University, said artists enjoy special care and respect in North Korean society.\n\u201cThe interesting thing is they don\u2019t consider themselves doing propaganda art,\u201d said Muhn, who met artists on nine trips to North Korea. \u201cThey feel they are doing art for the country, to serve the country and the people.\u201d\nFor decades, North Korean art was created largely for North Korean audiences. That changed in the 1990s when Pyongyang\u2019s biggest benefactor, the Soviet Union, collapsed. North Korea desperately needed cash, so it turned to its artists.\nThe government organized teams of artists to go to friendly countries in Africa and the Middle East, where they erected sculptures and painted murals eulogizing local leaders. Those efforts were financially lucrative. At the same time, the private art market took an interest, especially after South Korea began encouraging trade with its northern neighbor. Tens of thousands of paintings began flowing into South Korea, often through Chinese dealers.\nAfter Kim Jong Un took power in 2011, Pyongyang began loosening its grip on the artists\u2019 creativity. They were told they no longer had to make portraits glorifying state leaders. Business boomed: Pyongyang\u2019s state-run Mansudae studio outfitted a museum in Cambodia and was paid to erect statutes of soldiers and dictators in Senegal, the Congo, Angola, and over a dozen other sites across Africa. North Korea reaped tens of millions of dollars in art sales.\nThat success evaporated when the U.N. slapped sanctions on Pyongyang in 2016 and 2017 after a series of nuclear and missile tests. Detectives questioned an art dealer in Italy and seized paintings in South Korea. Pyongyang\u2019s art exports slowed, then ground to a halt when North Korea sealed its borders during the pandemic.\nBut there are signs that North Korea\u2019s isolation is thawing. China\u2019s relations with North Korea have warmed as ties with the West have soured. Moscow is courting Pyongyang, with Kim visiting Russia in September to discuss arms sales amid the war with Ukraine.\nArt and cultural exchanges are now resuming, Jin wrote recently.\n\u201cArt is becoming an important way for the outside world to understand North Korea,\u201d Jin wrote on WeChat. \u201cThrough unremitting effort and by expanding their horizons, North Korean artists will definitely go abroad and out into the world.\u201d\n___\nCorrects to say that North Korean landscape paintings were being sold at a Beijing art exposition for less than a hundred dollars, not a few hundred dollars.\nAP writer Alan Suderman contributed to this story from Washington.\nContact AP\u2019s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org",

China is trialling a prototype digital yuan with 200 million users, while the European Central Bank has just begun two years of advanced-stage exploratory work.\n\"Issuing a CBDC will have major implications for the business model of central banks and the risks they face, and it will modify their risk profiles,\" the BIS report said.\nIt added that CBDCs using new technologies such as distributed ledger technology (DLT) will face \"unique cyber risks\" as there is no widely accepted cyber security framework currently.\nFurthermore, central banks are flying somewhat blind as there is \"limited real world data on the key threats to CBDCs, regardless of the type of technology they use.\"\n(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Christina Fincher)",

Rich countries had previously signalled the target would not be met until 2023.\nThe goal is politically symbolic and failure to meet it has stoked mistrust in past climate talks, hampering other deals to tackle climate change as poorer nations argue the world's economic powers are leaving them in the lurch.\nThe data come two weeks ahead of the United Nations' COP28 climate summit, which starts in Dubai on Nov. 30.\nFinance is a sore point in U.N. climate talks, as developing economies say they cannot adapt to extreme weather or invest in cleaner energy without more support from the rich nations whose historical fossil fuel burning caused climate change.\n\"Based on preliminary and as yet unverified data, the goal looks likely to have already been met as of 2022,\" said Mathias Cormann, Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nThe $100 billion is far below poor nations' actual climate investment needs, which by 2025 could total $1 trillion per year, the OECD said.\n\"The delivery of the $100 billion is vitally important,\" said Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, a nation vulnerable to rising sea levels.\n\"From building sea walls to adapt to climate change, to installing renewables, to helping people rebuild their lives and livelihoods if they're forced to move \u2013 all of these things cost money,\" she said.\nThe OECD confirmed the target was not met in 2021. That year, wealthy nations provided $89.6 billion, an 8% increase from 2020 levels.\nMost of the 2021 money - $73 billion - was public finance and, of this, more than two thirds was loans.\nThe OECD warned, however, that this funding - from sources including multilateral development banks and national aid agencies - has so far failed to mobilise substantial private capital, which is needed to cover the climate investment gap.

It does raise the risk of the BOJ stepping into the (forex) market to strengthen the yen, but I think markets are expecting no intervention unless dollar/yen moves to about 152,\" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\nThe Aussie and the kiwi were likewise headed for a 2.3% and 1.75% weekly decline against the dollar respectively, also their steepest drop in months.\n\"Even though we don't expect Powell to deliver on the tightening bias, that tightening bias does support the dollar,\" said Kong.\nThe Australian dollar last stood at $0.63615 after slipping to a one-week low of $0.6352 earlier in the session, while the New Zealand dollar was last at $0.5895, having similarly hit a one-week trough of $0.5886 earlier.\nFalling oil prices and a faltering economic recovery in China have also kept a lid on the Antipodean currencies.\nAustralia's central bank, in its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy released on Friday, warned there were risks of further upside surprises to inflation following its latest hike in interest rates, though investors remained doubtful.\nElsewhere, the euro steadied at $1.06665, while sterling rose 0.05% to $1.2227. They were both on track to lose roughly 0.6% and 1.2% for the week, respectively.\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, meanwhile held near an 18-month high and last bought $36,653, having peaked at $37,978 in the previous session, its highest level since May 2022.\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency Ether jumped to its highest since April at $2,136.50.\nPrices of the digital assets have surged on swirling speculation of an imminent approval of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, with the asset management giant also having registered to create an ethereum trust.\n\"The potential approval of spot ETFs by the (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) could significantly impact the cryptocurrency sector,\" said Carl Szantyr, managing partner of digital asset hedge fund Blockstone Capital.\n\"Such an endorsement would make it more accessible for institutional investors to enter the crypto space, likely boosting demand and subsequently, prices.\"\n(Reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Kim Coghill)",

According to the United Nations, more than 1.8 million have been displaced by military offensives, which critics charge have involved gross violations of human rights.\nWar crimes have become easier to document in recent years thanks largely to the ubiquity of cellphone cameras and the near-universal access to social media, where photo and video evidence can easily be posted and viewed.\nBut it's harder to establish who is responsible for such crimes, especially generals and other high-ranking officers behind the scenes who make the plans and give the orders.\n\u201cGenerals and lower ranking officers should fear being dragged before a court of law and imprisoned for crimes they ordered or authorized,\u201d Tom Andrews, the United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, told the AP by email. \u201cResearch must move beyond merely stating the obvious \u2014 that crimes are occurring \u2014 and connect those who are responsible to specific atrocities. The victims of these crimes deserve justice and that will require the research necessary to hold those responsible fully accountable.\u201d\nThe new website, myanmar.securityforcemonitor.org, is an interactive online version of a report, \u201cUnder Whose Command? \u2014 Human rights abuses under Myanmar\u2019s military rule,\u201d compiled by Security Force Monitor, a project of the Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute, to connect alleged crimes with their perpetrators.\nThe project\u2019s team constructed a timeline of senior commanders and their postings, which can be correlated with documented instances of alleged atrocities that occurred under their commands. It exposes the army\u2019s chain of command, identifying senior army commanders and showing the connections from alleged rights violations to these commanders, study director Tony Wilson told The Associated Press in an email interview.\n\u201cThis is one of the pieces of the jigsaw that has up until now been missing in terms of accountability \u2014 demonstrating how the system works and that these abuses are not just the result of rogue units or individual soldiers,\u201d he said.\nWilson said the Myanmar data show that 65%, or 51 of all 79 senior army commanders between the end of March 2011 and the end of March this year, \u201chad alleged disappearances, killings, rape or instances of torture committed by units under their command.\u201d\nHe said the study also shows the officer with the most links to serious human rights violations is Gen. Mya Htun Oo, who became defense minister and a member of the ruling military council when the army seized power in 2021. He also became deputy prime minister in 2023.\nThe legal significance leans on the established doctrine of \u201ccommand responsibility,\u201d which allows the prosecution under international law of military commanders for war crimes perpetrated by their subordinates.\n\u201cEstablishing the command structures of militaries and other groups involved in atrocities is the lifeblood of properly conducting investigations into international crimes,\u201d Mark Kersten, assistant professor of criminology and criminal justice at Canada\u2019s University of the Fraser Valley, said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cWhen the Nazis were prosecuted at Nuremberg, the lead counsel for the Allies famously exclaimed that it was individuals who would be prosecuted for atrocities, and not abstract entities, namely states.\u201d\nCollecting evidence of human rights violations in Syria\u2019s civil war has served as a guide to utilizing online information and technical advances to gather and organize evidence of war crimes. Similar projects have also been launched in other areas of conflict including Sudan, Yemen and Ukraine.\nSince 2021, evidence-gathering groups have formed in Myanmar, including Myanmar Witness, an NGO that seeks to \u201ccollect, analyse, verify and store evidence related to human rights incidents \u2026 in a way that is compatible with future human rights prosecutions.\u201d\nSimilar work for Myanmar has already been done by groups documenting the security forces\u2019 brutal 2017 counterinsurgency campaign in the western part of the country that drove an estimated 740,000 Rohingya to seek safety across the border in Bangladesh. Several international tribunals have been considering charges of genocide and other crimes brought against the army for their activities.\n\u201cOur work can complement and feed into the work of documenting abuses,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cBecause we always aim to map the entire police or military, our research can help make connections between what human rights groups have documented and the wider chain of command.\u201d\nHe said the project relied on open-source information drawn from the work of national and international human rights organizations and local activists, as well as books, independent newspapers and the military\u2019s own media outlets.\nIts previous work includes research on the Mexican Army\u2019s chain of command for a complaint to the International Criminal Court alleging crimes against humanity. Its methodology has been used to support the Syrian Archive\u2019s submission of evidence to investigative and prosecute authorities in Germany, France, and Sweden about the 2013 sarin gas attack on Khan Shaykhun.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve applied lessons learned from researching militaries around the world to our work in Myanmar, and we would not have been able to map the Myanmar Army without those lessons,\u201d said Wilson.",

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - African countries are less likely to follow East Asia's development model of expanding manufacturing to pull people out of poverty, according to a study that shows a declining share of factory jobs for most countries by mid-century.\nThe new paper released on Monday by the Center for Global Development shows there will be fewer factory workers in 2050 globally than there are now, and that even in poor countries with abundant cheap labor, manufacturing job growth will stagnate.\nChina may be an exception, further expanding its share of manufacturing output among 59 countries modeled in the study to 43.8% in 2050 from 30% in 2018 and 10.5% in 1975.\nThe study's authors say that China will continue to dominate global manufacturing, moving into higher-value segments.\nWhile this may create some space for other developing countries in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America to move into lower-end manufacturing in low-end sectors abandoned by China, it won't be enough to replicate the transformative East Asian development model of moving from Agriculture to manufacturing.\nInstead, CGD senior fellows Charles Kenny and Ranil Dissanayake say that many countries will move straight from agriculture to services, where jobs will expand rapidly, especially because of new technologies -- even in countries such as Bangladesh and Ethiopia.\n\"There\u2019s still a popular idea that low-income countries will progress naturally from being dominated by agriculture to manufacturing-led growth, but mounting evidence suggests that\u2019s not going to happen,\" said Kenny. \"We think that farms are going to empty out across Africa and Asia in the coming decades, but people are likely to flood into offices and shops, not factories.\"\nThe study projects global growth through the year 2050 and models changes in the economies of 59 countries accounting for about three quarters of the world\u2019s GDP and population.\nIt projects that even for the lowest-income countries, the number of factory jobs will barely keep pace with population growth over the next 30 years, and manufacturing is likely to remain a small part of most of these countries\u2019 economies.\nAcross all low-income countries, manufacturing jobs are projected to hold steady at below 8% of total employment, the study finds. It projects the share of manufacturing jobs in high-income countries will continue to fall, to 8.3% by 2050 from 11.4% currently.\nIt said that private service sector jobs will make up roughly 37% of global jobs by 2050, and 26% in today\u2019s low-income countries, up from about 12% currently.

In our view the bid offer for first cuts is June to Q3 next year,\" he said.\nElsewhere, the Japanese yen flattened at 149.58, after strengthening following data that showed Japan's core consumer price growth picked up slightly in October, having eased the previous month.\nThat reinforced investors' views that stubborn inflation may push the BOJ to roll back monetary stimulus before long.\nThe Asian currency has slowly crawled away from the near 33-year low of 151.92 it touched at the start of last week and is up 1.5% for the month.\nING economists said they expect the BOJ to move away from its super-accommodative stance next year.\n\"We believe that the BOJ may scrap the yield curve programme as early as the first quarter of next (year), as Japanese government bonds appear to have stabilised,\" they said.\nThe bank will \"then begin its first rate hike in Q2 2024 if wage growth continues to accelerate next year\".\nThe nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.9% year-on-year in October, government data showed on Friday, against 3.0% expected by economists in a Reuters poll.\nJapan's factory activity shrank for a sixth straight month in November, while modest growth in the service sector was little changed, a business survey showed on Friday, highlighting the fragility of the economy amid soft demand and inflation.\nThe euro edged 0.05% higher to $1.0911, after data confirmed an initial estimate published in late October that showed Germany's economy shrank slightly in the third quarter compared with the previous three months.\nThe single currency is pausing for breath after gaining some ground on Thursday after a series of preliminary surveys showed recession in Germany may be shallower than expected, which offset a downbeat reading on French business activity.\nSterling flattened at $1.2541.\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore and Joice Alves in London; Editing by Jan Harvey)",

        "text": "\nBy Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed in October in part as strikes by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union against Detroit's \"Big Three\" car makers depressed manufacturing payrolls, and the increase in annual wages was the smallest in nearly 2-1/2 years, pointing to an easing in labor market conditions.\nThe Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate rising to 3.9% last month, the highest level since January 2022, from 3.8 in September.\nThe economy added 101,000 fewer jobs in August and September than previously estimated, also suggesting slowing labor market momentum. The report strengthened financial market expectations that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates for the current cycle, and improved the chances of the U.S. central bank engineering a \"soft-landing\" for the economy rather than plunging it into recession as some economists had feared.\n\"This is a very Fed-friendly report,\" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. \"The only wrinkle is that the labor force shrank. Still, the overall softness in the report will go a long way to keeping the Fed on the sidelines for a third straight meeting in December.\"\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 jobs last month after rising by 297,000 in September, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 180,000.\nAbout 52.0% of private sector industries reported increases in employment, the lowest since April 2020, compared to 61.4% in September, the survey of establishments showed.\nManufacturing employment dropped 35,000, with the UAW strike at Ford Motor, General Motors and Chrysler parent Stellantis factories as well as at Mack Trucks plants subtracting 33,000 jobs.\nIn addition to the industrial action, which has since ended, the slowdown in employment gains last month was pay-back after September's gains, which were the largest in eight months.\nThough hiring is slowing as a result of the cumulative impact of rate hikes from the Fed, payroll gains remain way above the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\n\"A payroll increase of 150,000 is not bad, and 180,000 - what it would have been without the strike and ancillary impacts - is solid,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. \"So, no need to worry about excessive weakness at least until we see what the post-strike environment looks like.\"\nLast month's increase in hiring was led by the healthcare sector, which added 58,000 jobs, the bulk of them in ambulatory health care services. Employment in government increased by 51,000 positions, returning to its pre-pandemic level. The rise in government payrolls was driven by local government hiring.\nThe construction industry added 23,000 jobs. There were also gains in social assistance as well as professional and business services payrolls, with temporary help jobs - a harbinger of future hiring - rebounding after eight straight monthly declines. Leisure and hospitality employment rose 19,000, well below the monthly average of 52,000 in the last 12 months.\nThe transportation and warehousing industry suffered job losses as did the information industry, continuing to be weighed down by an ongoing strike in Hollywood.\nFinancial markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to keep rates unchanged in December and January, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. Stocks on Wall Street rallied. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note hitting a five-week low.\nWAGE GROWTH COOLS\nThe U.S. central bank held rates unchanged on Wednesday but left the door open to a further rise in borrowing costs in a nod to the economy's resilience. Since March 2022, it has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% band.\nAverage hourly earnings rose 0.2% in October after climbing 0.3% in September. In the 12 months through October, wages increased 4.1%, the smallest increase since June 2021, after rising 4.3% in September. The average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.4 hours. Aggregate hours worked fell 0.3%. Both reflected the impact of the auto strikes on the economy.\nThe labor market is the major force behind the economy's staying power, with gross domestic product recording an annualized growth pace of nearly 5% in the third quarter.\nThough wage pressures are easing because of a recent expansion of the labor pool and fewer people changing jobs, the annual growth in average hourly earnings remains above the 3.5% that economists say is consistent with the Fed's 2% target.\n\"We'll see a significant deceleration in growth in the fourth quarter, but not in a way that we're plunging into any kind of recession,\" said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Forecasting.\nEconomists were split on the impact of record-breaking labor contracts, including the ones scored by the UAW, airline pilots and the union representing UPS workers, on wage inflation.\nSome argued that the recent surge in worker productivity, if maintained, would be enough to offset the higher compensation. Others pointed out that the U.S. economy was now predominantly based on services, which would make it harder to boost productivity.\nEbbing labor market momentum was also evident in the smaller household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived. Household employment fell 348,000, accounting for the rise in the jobless rate. The strike also impacted the unemployment rate. About 201,000 people dropped out of the labor force.\nThat lowered the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, to 62.7% from 62.8% in September.\nThe prime-age group participation rate declined, mostly because of men dropping out of the labor force.\nThe ranks of Americans experiencing long-term unemployment increased 66,000 to 1.282 million. The number of people working part-time for economic reasons rose 218,000 to 4.283 million. There was also an increase in people working multiple jobs.\n\"October's employment report, in conjunction with the third-quarter report on productivity and costs, clearly indicates that the economy has converged already to potentially a more sustainable path of low inflation and solid potential growth,\" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Paul Simao)",

        "text": "\nCitibank systematically discriminated against Armenian Americans for six years, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wednesday, and now has to pay $25.9 million in fines and consumer redress.\nThe government watchdog said that from 2015 to 2021, Citi \u201ctreated Armenian Americans as criminals who were likely to commit fraud.\u201d Citi managers trained and directed employees to target retail services credit card applicants based on their surnames and area of residence. Those living in or around Glendale, Calif., which is home to 15% of Armenian Americans in the US, were singled out for rejection.\nThe actions are a violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the CFPB noted, as applicants were denied services based on their nationality. Now, the nation\u2019s third-largest bank has to pay $1.4 million to harmed consumers \u2014 along with a $24.5 million fine to the CFPB\u2019s victims relief fund.\n\u201cArmenian-Americans commonly have last names with certain endings. Citi developed a scheme where the company would flag applicants with these last names,\u201d CFPB director Rohit Chopra, said in a statement. \u201cCiti also used applicants\u2019 place of residence to guess national origin.\u201d\nChopra added: \u201cCiti often rejected these applicants outright. When Citi did not, the bank subjected those who may be of Armenian descent to additional scrutiny. The internal message to Citi employees was clear: root out Armenian-American applicants.\u201d\nIn response to the announcement on Wednesday, Citigroup issued an apology, indicating that a small group of employees took \u201cimpermissible actions\u201d in an attempt to thwart fraud surrounding a \u201cwell-documented Armenian fraud ring operating in parts of California.\u201d\n\u201cWe sincerely apologize to any applicant who was evaluated unfairly by the small number of employees who circumvented our fraud detection protocols,\u201d Citigroup said in a statement provided to the press. \u201cFollowing an internal investigation, we have taken appropriate actions with those directly involved in this matter and we promptly put in place measures to prevent any recurrence of such conduct.\u201d\nThe court order said the practice of discrimination affected credit card applicants, including those seeking a new credit card or a credit line increase on an existing card because these were \u201csubject to manual underwriting\u201d by certain employees from Citi\u2019s retail services unit.\nCourt documents said any employees or agents who have the authority to approve or deny a credit card, those who assist or supervise those employees or agents, and those involved in risk detection, compliance, or fraud prevention related to credit cards were under review.\nAccording to the court order, some Citi employees referred to these applicants as \u201cArmenian bad guys\u201d or the \u201cSouthern California Armenian Mafia.\u201d\nThe CFPB noted that Citi employees purposefully barred applicants with a last name ending in -ian or -yan and addresses known to have a high concentration of Armenian Americans. These disparities in underwriting were \u201chighly unlikely to have occurred by chance.\u201d\nThe CFPB also said that Citi supervisors \u201cconspired to hide the discrimination\u201d by instructing employees to avoid discussing discriminatory practices in writing or on recorded phone lines. Citi employees also lied to denied applicants about their basis of denial.\n\u201cAt one point, a Citi employee explained it had been a while since they had denied an application because of a consumer\u2019s Armenian surname, and wanted a suggestion on how to cover up the discrimination,\u201d the CFPB said. \u201cThe response was to decline the credit card application due to suspected credit abuse, which essentially blamed the applicant for the denial.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s action makes clear that banks and other lenders, regardless of their size or political clout, cannot deny an individual\u2019s application for credit merely based on their name and perceived national origin,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cThe CFPB\u2019s case against Citi shows that each person who applies for credit is entitled to fair, non-discriminatory consideration of their application.\u201d\nGabriella is a personal finance and housing reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\nBy Phil Stewart\nTOKYO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. military's top general expressed optimism on Friday for a potential improvement in military-to-military ties with China and sent an introductory letter to his Chinese counterpart saying he was open to meeting.\nAir Force General Charles Q. Brown, who took over as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff just over a month ago, also said he did not believe that Chinese President Xi Jinping necessarily wanted to take Taiwan by force, while not ruling out the possibility.\nThe remarks by Brown during a trip to Japan came ahead of expected talks next week between Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden as they seek to stabilise tense relations.\nPentagon officials say a restoration of military ties, largely severed by Beijing, is crucial to preventing a miscalculation from spiralling into conflict.\n\"I think there's an opportunity and ... as the President potentially meets with Xi next week, we're getting indications that there is some interest,\" Brown told a small group of reporters in Tokyo. \"If the opportunity presents itself, I will definitely engage.\"\nBrown did not specify to whom he sent the introductory letter. But China's General Liu Zhenli is the Chief of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the military body responsible for China's combat operations and planning.\nBrown said he sent a standard introductory letter that explained, \"I'm in the position and willing to open a line of communication.\"\nU.S. officials have cautioned that even with some restoration of military communications, forging truly functional dialogue between the two sides could take time.\nSome analysts say China seeks ambiguity in defence relations to constrain what Beijing sees as U.S. military provocations in the region.\nTAIWAN\nWashington and Beijing are at loggerheads over everything from the future of democratically ruled Taiwan to territorial claims in the South China Sea. Diplomatic relations are still recovering after the U.S. downed an alleged Chinese spy balloon in February.\nBrown appeared to downplay Xi's enthusiasm for a potential invasion of Taiwan, in part given the military difficulty of such an operation. CIA Director William Burns has said Xi has instructed his country's armed forces to be ready to invade by 2027.\n\"I do think that Xi Jinping doesn't necessarily want to take Taiwan by force. He will try to use other ways to do this,\" Brown told a small group of reporters in Tokyo. \"I also believe that taking Taiwan by force and doing a major amphibious operation is not an easy feat.\"\nBrown, a former commander of the U.S. Air Force in the Asia-Pacific region, has met People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials in the past, including the People's Liberation Army Air Force's northern theatre commander in 2019 during a visit to Seoul.\nLiu has emerged as the top contender to replace China's country's defence minister, General Li Shangfu, who was dismissed from his position last month. Reuters reported in September that Li was under investigation over suspected corruption related to equipment procurement and development.\nBrown acknowledged corruption in the Chinese military when asked about Li's removal, and broader issues in the PLA, but also noted \"alignment with Xi Jinping and his thinking as he continues to consolidate power\".\nLi was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018 for an arms deal he secured with Russia in an earlier role. China had demanded the sanctions - which include a visa ban and prohibitions on conducting U.S. financial transactions - be lifted.\nLiu, 59, is not under Western sanctions.\nAny decision to improve military-to-military ties - frozen by Beijing when then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August 2022 - would be made by Xi, who has the ultimate say in all important policies and appointments.\nXi is also commander in chief of the armed forces and chairman of the CMC, China's top defence decision-making body, on which Liu already sits.

It had a more than a 12,600-vote margin at Ford and a 9,600-vote lead at Stellantis with just a few small locals' results yet to vote or be reported.\nThe votes locks in the UAW's tentative agreement with the Detroit Three automakers through April 2028, which includes a 25% increase in base wages and will cumulatively raise the top wage by 33%, compounded with estimated cost-of-living adjustments to over $42 an hour.\nWorkers on Thursday at General Motors voted to approve the deal, with about 55% of nearly 36,000 members in favor.\nStellantis, Ford and the UAW did not comment.\nThe deal includes a $5,000 bonus and an 11% immediate pay hike upon ratification. The contract also hikes wages of current temporary workers by 150% by 2028 and will make them permanent employees.\nThe agreement also cuts the time needed to get to top pay from eight years to three years.\nThe new contract follows an unprecedented six-week campaign of coordinated strikes at the Detroit Three automakers.\nUltimately, the union was able to clinch record pay hikes for auto workers after years of stagnant wages and painful concessions following the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe UAW now plans to turn its focus to organizing non-union auto factories operated by foreign automakers and Tesla .\nWhen President Joe Biden, a Democrat, visited Illinois last week, he backed the UAW's efforts to unionize Tesla and Toyota , adding that all U.S. auto workers deserve a deal similar to the UAW's recent agreements with the Detroit Three.\nHyundai Motor, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor have all announced significant wage hikes for U.S. factory workers after the UAW contract deals were announced.\nAutomakers are looking to trim costs as they make the shift to electric vehicles and face higher hourly labor costs. Ford has estimated the new contract will add $850 to $900 in labor costs per vehicle.\nStellantis said Monday it was offering 6,400 U.S. salaried employees voluntary buyouts. The buyouts offered are to about half the company's salaried U.S. employees not represented by a union, which is currently 12,700. Another 2,500 Stellantis U.S. salaried workers are unionized and are not being offered the current buyout.

He is due to meet Biden at an undisclosed location in the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday morning and then attend the annual summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.\nXi's summit with Biden will be the firstface-to-face meeting between the U.S. and Chinese leaders in a year and has been billed by U.S. officials as an opportunity to reduce friction in what many see as the world's most dangerous rivalry.\nXi waved from the steps of his Air China plane upon arrival and descended to meet U.S. officials on the tarmac, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.\nHe then got into his Chinese Hongqi, or \"Red Flag,\" limousine and departed the airport into San Francisco, where demonstrations are expected both for and against his visit.\nLess than two hours earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed ministers of the 21-member APEC and stressed the U.S. believed in \"a region where economies are free to choose their own path ... where goods, ideas, people flow lawfully and freely.\"\nBlinken did not mention China by name, but his language echoed U.S. rhetoric in recent years in which Washington has accused China of bullying smaller countries in the Indo-Pacific and trying to undermine what the U.S. and its allies call the \"rules-based\" order.\nU.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, who with Blinken opened the APEC ministerial session, said the San Francisco meeting came at a time of \"great uncertainty and challenges\" for the region. She noted increasing geopolitical tensions, fragile supply chains and a worsening climate crisis.\nEarlier, Biden said he aimed to improve the relationship with China after a period of strained ties and would seek to resume normal communications between the two superpowers, including military-to-military contacts.\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that Biden and Xi would also talk about the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza as well as U.S. efforts to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian military.\nEconomic issues will be high on the agenda.\nBiden said the U.S. does not want to decouple from China, but wants to change the economic relationship for the better. His administration has made a push to \"de-risk\" some critical U.S. supply chains from China as the two countries\u2019 economic and military competition has grown.\nXi, who is seeking to entice foreign investment during the APEC to counter his country's recent struggles, is expected to dine with top U.S. business executives on Wednesday.\nFor American businesses, it will be a chance to hear directly from China's leader as they search for ways to navigate that country's economic slowdown and uncertainty caused by expanding Chinese security rules.\nCONCERNS ABOUT A SHOWDOWN\nBiden has been careful to assure countries in the region, including China, that the U.S. does not seek complete economic separation, a notion that has fueled concerns among Washington's partners and allies of a superpower showdown that would upend the global economy.\nChina severed military-to-military contacts with the U.S. after then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited democratically governed but Chinese-claimed Taiwan in August 2022.\nRestoring the contacts is a top U.S. goal to avoid miscalculations between the two militaries.\nWashington also hopes for more cooperation from Beijing in combating production of the potent synthetic opioid drug fentanyl, which has become a scourge in the United States and particularly in San Francisco.\nSino-U.S. relations worsened after Biden ordered the shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over the United States.\nTop Biden administration officials have since visited Beijing and met with their counterparts in an effort to rebuild communications and trust.\nSeveral hundred mostly pro-China demonstrators carrying Chinese flags gathered outside the Chinese delegation's hotel ahead of Xi's arrival in the U.S.\nLarger protests, including by rights groups critical of Xi's policies in Tibet, Hong Kong and toward Muslim Uyghurs, are expected near the summit venue on Wednesday.\nAs Biden arrived in San Francisco, shortly before Xi was due to land, dueling demonstrators greeted the U.S. president's motorcade from the airport. Some waved Chinese flags and held banners calling for \"kindly\" and \"warm\" U.S.-Sino ties. Others held signs condemning the Chinese Communist Party.\nEarlier on Tuesday, a small aircraft flew circles over the APEC summit venue in downtown San Francisco, trailing a banner that read, \"END CCP FREE CHINA FREE HK FREE TIBET FREE UIGHUR,\" referring to China's treatment of Uyghurs, which the Biden administration calls \"genocide.\" (Reporting by Michael Martina, Ann Saphir, David Brunnstrom, Trevor Hunnicutt, David Lawder, Sayantani Ghosh and Peter Henderson; Editing by Leslie Adler, Chris Reese, Josie Kao, Don Durfee and Lincoln Feast.)",

Singapore ordered the firm to stop doing business in the city state. Hong Kong warned more than two years ago that Binance was an unregulated platform. Even Dubai, where CZ primarily resides, has yet to grant the exchange full authorization.\nRead: Binance\u2019s Lead in Offshore Markets Falls as Rivals Gain Ground\nBut beyond the embattled exchange business, another corner of the broad CZ-owned portfolio of crypto companies said it\u2019s seeing growth in countries like India and Pakistan \u2014 based on third-party data on downloads \u2014 as well as business opportunities in the UAE.\nTrust Wallet is a software-based crypto wallet service designed to let users self-custody the kinds of digital assets popular in decentralized finance applications. CZ acquired a majority stake in the company that operates Trust Wallet in 2018. Its current CEO since 2022, Eowyn Chen, was previously a vice president of marketing at Binance.\n\u201cI do want to make Asia a high priority for growth,\u201d Chen, who is 33, told Bloomberg News in an interview on the sidelines of a crypto conference in Australia last month.\nChen identified Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia as markets to expand for the platform. \u201cI would imagine the average revenue per user in those places will be lower, but the collective amount could potentially also be very interesting,\u201d she said.\nGlobally, the app-based service has 56 million downloads on iOS and Android, making it the most popular crypto wallet for handheld devices, according to Data.ai. Rival MetaMask is second, with 43 million such downloads. In India, Trust Wallet saw about 8.5 million downloads and in Pakistan some 3.5 million, followed by MetaMask, according to Data.ai.\nDespite the perceived growth potential in Asia, it is to the United Arab Emirates that the company is shifting its operations.\nChen herself moved to Dubai from Virginia in October, while the company will be based in Ras Al Khaimah, the sixth-largest city in the UAE. The company has about 80 employees worldwide with about 15%-20% in the UAE, Chen said.\nRead: The Emirate Pitching Itself as the Next Haven for Billionaires\n\u201cThe regulatory uncertainty in the US is a challenge,\u201d Chen said. \u201cSo we are also diversifying our risk management from a corporate perspective by setting up the UAE entity.\u201d\nChen described regulators in the UAE as having a \u201cfriendlier outlook toward crypto in general\u201d. That gives Trust Wallet confidence about the likelihood of \u201creasonable regulation on decentralized finance,\u201d Chen said.\nChen said Trust Wallet operates from the free trade zone of Ras Al Khaimah, where it has a business license. The zone is also known as RAK DAO, for \u201cDigital Asset Oasis,\u201d and caters primarily to blockchain companies.\nRAK has \u201cmore flexible and better corporate treatment\u201d for web3 companies, she said in explaining the reasons for basing operations there. Officials at RAK DAO declined to comment.\nA separate company, DApps Platform, holds the intellectual property rights for the wallet service and is based in Abu Dhabi Global Market, another free trade zone in the UAE, Chen said.\nTrust Wallet is not profitable yet, Chen said, and only started generating revenue in the last year.\nCZ and Trust Wallet\nWhile CZ doesn\u2019t have any role in Trust Wallet\u2019s day-to-day operations, he provides \u201coperational strategic advice\u201d as the majority owner of the entity. CZ \u201cbrings a lot of spotlight and exposure\u201d when he talks about Trust Wallet, Chen said.\nTrust Wallet\u2019s native token TWT jumped about 50% to $2.48 in a single day last November, after CZ promoted the app on X in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX crypto exchange. It was trading at about $1.11 as of 2:15 p.m. on Friday in Singapore, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much marketing budget. We probably only spend about a few thousand dollars per month on marketing,\u201d Chen said. \u201cA lot of our growth happened organically or with word-of-mouth promotions,\u201d she said.\nCZ\u2019s settlement with US prosecutors saw him resign as CEO of Binance, where he was replaced by Richard Teng. CZ additionally relinquished his role as chairman of Binance\u2019s US exchange while retaining an economic interest in that beleaguered platform.\nBinance recently launched a similar, branded crypto wallet that appears to compete directly with the Trust Wallet platform \u2014 and it remains to be seen whether Teng will seek to expand the Binance product aggressively.\nRead: New Binance CEO Teng\u2019s First Job Is to Avert Customer Exodus (3)\n--With assistance from Ben Bartenstein.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAnduril Builds a Tiny, Reusable Fighter Jet That Blows Up Drones\nB-School Admissions Deans Are Feeling The Pressure From Falling Applications\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

We\u2019ve reflected the latest trends and advertiser reaction that we\u2019ve seen into our Q4 outlook, which again, I think reflects the greater uncertainty and volatility ahead.\"\nThe company's shares initially rose as much as 4% in after-hours trading, but erased those gains in the aftermath of Meta's call and were over 3% lower in Thursday's pre-market.\nMeta's been navigating rough waters, steadying itself as an AI-powered advertising giant and working through its capital-intensive expansion into VR and AR. The Facebook and Instagram parent has been in the process of shoring up two key areas of interest for investors \u2014 its AI efforts and its position in the digital advertising market, which has been in a prolonged slump and is just showing signs of a rebound.\nMeta's Q3 advertising revenue came in at $33.64 billion, compared to the expected $32.94 billion. The company beat on ad impressions estimates, clocking an increase of 31% year over year, versus the expected 29.6%.\nMeta shares have risen more than 130% year to date, massively outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Internet Index, which are up around 9% and 34% this year, respectively.\n\"The stock has done well this year,\" Neuberger Bergman analyst Daniel Flax told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. \"[If they can] drive durable growth and translate that into earnings per share and free cash flow generation, I think the stock can continue to work its way higher.\"\nMeta's near future could be mired in legal risks, as the company is staring down federal and state lawsuits from 42 attorneys general, who are alleging that Facebook and Instagram's features geared toward children are addictive.\n\"We\u2019re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.\nCurrently, Wall Street analysts' recommendations for Meta break down to 60 Buys, seven Holds, and two Sells.\nHere are the key numbers that Meta reported, as compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\nRevenue: $34.15 billion actual, up 23% year-over-year, versus $33.52 billion expected\nEarnings per share: $4.39 actual, up 168% year-over-year, versus $3.60 expected\nFacebook daily active users: 2.09 billion actual, versus 2.07 billion expected\nReality Labs operating loss: $3.74 billion actual, versus $3.94 billion expected\nQ4 revenue outlook: $36.5 billion-$40 billion actual, versus $38.76 billion expected\nZuckerberg's \"Year of Efficiency\" initiatives seem to be paying off, as the company is decreasing its 2023 capital expenditures outlook. It's revising the range to be between $27 billion and $29 billion, a decline from the previously announced $27 billion to $30 billion.\nMeta's Family of Apps business, which also includes WhatsApp, raked in over $33 billion in revenue. The division's operating income was $17.49 billion for the quarter, handily beating analysts' expectation of $15.23 billion.\nBut Reality Labs, the company's mixed reality business, has been a subject of controversy. Since 2022, Meta has lost more than $20 billion running Reality Labs; $13.7 billion of that came from last year.\nThe company said it expects these losses to continue, and will increase notably year over year in 2023. Meta recently launched its Quest 3 headset, priced at $499.99.\n\"We had a good quarter for our community and business,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. \"I'm proud of the work our teams have done to advance AI and mixed reality with the launch of Quest 3, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and our AI studio.\"\nAllie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

But as the potential fallout of business-halting cyberattacks becomes too big to insure, issuers are seizing the moment.\nBeazley Plc, which owns specialist insurers across Europe and the US, is exploring a potential $100 million cyber cat bond, according to Artemis, a research firm specializing in insurance-linked securities. And Axis Capital is preparing to issue a $75 million cyber catastrophe bond, according to a preliminary offer document seen by Bloomberg.\nSpokespeople for Axis Capital and Beazley declined to comment on the deals.\nThe wider market for cat bonds is likely to reach a record $40 billion this year. A lot of that growth has been fueled by the impact of climate change, as extreme weather shocks threaten to make insurers\u2019 business models untenable. For that reason, some of the most active players in the cat bond market are reinsurers such as Swiss Re AG and Munich Re AG.\nInvestors have been drawn to returns that trounce those of US Treasuries. This year, the Swiss Re Global Cat Bond Performance Index is up 18%, while the Bloomberg US Treasury Index has dropped about 1%.\nIssuers of cyber cat bonds want to protect themselves from financial losses that can follow a major cyberattack, including lost revenue, legal fees and regulatory fines.\nRead More: ICBC Hit by Cyberattack, Tells Clients to Reroute Trades\nInsurance-linked securities \u201coffer corporate boards and business owners a degree of comfort over their balance sheet resilience in the event of a larger cyber event,\u201d according to a recent report co-authored by Kathleen Faries, chief executive officer of Artex Capital Solutions.\nBut with limited historical data to analyze, as well as increasingly sophisticated forms of cyber crime, investors face unusually high levels of risk.\n\u201cWith hurricanes we have decades of data,\u201d said Marco della Giacoma, portfolio manager at Tenax Capital, a London-based hedge fund that regularly invests in cat bonds. \u201cBut it\u2019s more difficult to price cyber risk.\u201d\nToby Pughe, an analyst at Tenax, says it\u2019s hard to trust a cyber model. \u201cIf they say the loss estimate is 1%, it could actually be 5% or 6%,\u201d he said.\nOther investors said they welcome the opportunity to get more exposure to the market for insurance-linked securities.\n\u201cWe are now seeing leading cyber underwriters positioning themselves to tap the ILS market with transparent deal structures that target catastrophe\u2014rather than attritional\u2014risk, in a form and at pricing levels that we believe have become attractive,\u201d said Joanna Syroka, director of new markets at Fermat Capital Management, one of the biggest cat bond investors.\nFermat \u201cwill consider all deals as they are announced,\u201d she said. \u201cCyber could be the fastest growing line of ILS, in line with the growth rate of the underlying cyber insurance market, due to the relative lack of internal diversification within the peril.\u201d\nPaul Bantick, global head of cyber risks at Beazley, said the threat of cyber losses is now such that \u201ctraditional reinsurance can\u2019t get you there.\u201d Though he declined to comment on specific deals, Bantick said the message from investors is \u201cthe time is now\u201d for cat bonds to fill the reinsurance gap.\nThere has been a handful of cyber cat bonds issued so far, including three privately placed by Beazley. The new securities expected from Axis and Beazley are notable because they will likely trade on secondary markets, providing access to a much wider pool of hedge funds, pensions and other investors.\nHannover Re, which underwrote about \u20ac800 million ($856 million) of premiums for cybersecurity last year, is also exploring the new market.\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly confident we\u2019ll use cat bonds to transfer cyber risk to the capital markets,\u201d said Henning Ludolphs, a managing director at the German reinsurer. \u201cThis could be sooner rather than later, maybe even within the next couple of months.\u201d\nThe list of known cyberattacks is long and growing. In 2017, suspected Russian malware shut down Ukrainian banks, government agencies, drugmaker Merck & Co. and shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, an event that cost $10 billion in losses, according to the White House. In 2021, an attack on the computer network of Colonial Pipeline disrupted US oil supplies.\nLast year, the number of ransomware attacks against industrial firms alone surged 87%, cybersecurity firm Dragos Inc. estimates. Earlier this month, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. was hit by a cyberattack that prevented it from clearing swathes of trades. The incident forced clients of the world\u2019s largest lender by assets to reroute transactions, leaving brokers and traders scrambling to assess the extent of the impact.\nAnd DP World Plc has been struggling to work through a backlog of 30,000 shipping containers piled up at ports across Australia as the company resumes operations following a cyberattack on Friday.\nRead More: Cyberattack Keeps Australian Ports Offline as Containers Pile Up\nIn the US, losses stemming from cyber crime soared 48% to $10.2 billion last year from 2021, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And a recent PwC survey of CEOs found that a quarter consider their companies to be highly or extremely exposed to cyber risk over the next five years. They outnumber the 22% who voiced similar concerns about the threat of climate change.\nThe perceived risks are reflected in costs. Munich Re estimates the premiums that corporations will have to pay to insure themselves against cyberattacks are set to almost triple to $33 billion between 2022 and 2027.\n\u201cCyber risk is one of Munich Re\u2019s main strategic growth areas,\u201d said Chris Storer, head of the reinsurer\u2019s cyber center of excellence.\nTheo Norris, head of cyber insurance-linked securities at Gallagher Securities, said \u201cthere are enough ILS investors to make a dent in the capital needs of the cyber insurance market.\u201d\nFor Gallagher Securities, which structured and placed Beazley\u2019s private cyber cat bonds, the goal is to \u201ccontinue building on this to attract even more ILS investment to support our clients and ultimately make cyber insurance more available and affordable,\u201d he said.\n(Adds details of weekend cyberattack on Australian ports.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nA German Startup Races Google to Develop a Universal Translator\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

        "text": "\n(Recasts, adds details and background throughout)\nBy Michael S. Derby\nNEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) -\nThe Cleveland Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it has begun to search for a replacement for its current president, Loretta Mester, a veteran central banker who has led the regional bank since 2014.\nMester is scheduled to retire on June 30, 2024 due to Fed rules that limit officials' service based on age and length of service. Over her tenure, she has been one of the U.S. central bank's more hawkish voices and has at times favored a tighter monetary policy stance than her colleagues.\nThe search process will be overseen by members of the Cleveland Fed's Board of Directors who do not come from firms the central bank regulates.\nThe process will be led by Heidi Gartland, the chief government and community relations officer with University Hospitals and the deputy chair of the Cleveland Fed's board. The U.S. central bank must approve the Cleveland Fed's choice.\nThe 12 regional Fed banks are quasi-private institutions that are technically owned by local banks, although they operate under the control of the Fed's Board of Governors in Washington. Their respective boards are drawn from the private sector.\nIn a press release announcing the start of the search, Gartland said, \"Mester's strong leadership over the past decade has positioned the Cleveland Fed as an important resource to the community and the nation.\"\nGartland added that \"thanks in no small part to her intellect, energy, and dedication to public service, the Cleveland Fed today is known around the globe for its top-quality economic research, financial institution supervision, community development outreach, and delivery of financial services.\"\nLEADERSHIP FLUX\nSearches for regional Fed banks have become contentious in recent years due to the opacity of the process. Whereas Fed officials in Washington are selected by the U.S. president and confirmed by the Senate in a public process, regional Fed leaders are chosen behind closed doors and the public rarely knows who is in contention for a position that helps set the nation's monetary policy and regulates local financial institutions.\nIn the last few years, regional Fed leadership has been in flux.\nTwo officials left early\nin September 2021 amid questions about their investment activities, while the Kansas City Fed dealt\nwith an extended search\nfor new leadership even as its own former leader, Esther George, had faced mandatory retirement. Also, the St. Louis Fed is still searching for a new boss after its former chief, James Bullard,\nabruptly quit over the summer\nto take a position leading Purdue University's business school.\nFed banks have also been under increased pressure in recent years to diversify their leadership away from the white males drawn from business or finance who have typically dominated those positions. And to that end, a number of regional Fed banks have flagged diversity as a key consideration in their respective search processes.\nMester will exit the Fed after spending most of her professional life within the central bank. Before coming to the Cleveland Fed, Mester led the research department of the Philadelphia Fed.\nMester, according to data from Wrightson ICAP, dissented in 8% of her Federal Open Market Committee votes in favor of a tighter policy stance than preferred by other policymakers. Mester\nnotably voted against parts\nof the Fed's initial response to the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.\nRegional Fed leaders\nmust retire\nwhen they hit 65. If they join the central bank after the age of 55, they can be allowed to serve for 10 years, or until 75, whichever comes first. According to Brookings Institution data, the next regional Fed official who must exit due to age is Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in June 2025. (Reporting by Michael S.

I know it's not easy for many of them, but we don't want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire,\" Mark Regev, an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told MSNBC on Friday.\nSuch a move could compel hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled south from the Israeli assault on Gaza City to relocate again, along with residents of the southern city of Khan Younis, worsening a dire humanitarian crisis.\nKhan Younis has a population of more than 400,000.\nIsrael vowed to annihilate the Hamas militant group that controls the Gaza Strip following an Oct. 7 rampage into Israel in which its fighters killed 1,200 people and dragged 240 hostages into the enclave.\nSince then, Israel has bombed much of Gaza City to rubble, ordered the depopulation of the entire northern half of the enclave and left homeless around two-thirds of the strip's 2.3 million Palestinians.\nMany of those who have fled fear their displacement could become permanent.\nGaza health authorities raised their death toll on Friday to more than 12,000 people, 5,000 of them children. The United Nations deems those figures credible, though they are now updated infrequently due to the difficulty of collecting information.\nIsrael overnight Thursday dropped leaflets over eastern areas of Khan Younis telling people to evacuate to shelters, suggesting that military operations there are imminent.\nRegev said that Israeli Defence Forces will have to advance into the city to oust Hamas fighters from underground tunnels and bunkers, but that no such \"enormous infrastructure\" exists in less built-up areas to the west.\n\"I'm pretty sure that they won't have to move again\" if they move west, he continued. \"We're asking them to move to an area where hopefully there will be tents and a field hospital.\"\nBecause the western areas are closer to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, humanitarian aid could be brought in \"as quickly as possible,\" he said.\nFUEL DELIVERIES\nWith the war entering its seventh week, there was no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.\n\"We have prepared ourselves for a long and sustained defence from all directions. The more time the occupation's forces stay in Gaza, the heavier their continuous losses,\" Abu Ubaida, Hamas armed wing spokesman, said in a video statement.\nAmid warnings that its siege would cause starvation and disease, Israel on Friday appeared to bow to international pressure, agreeing to allow fuel trucks into Gaza and promising \"no limitation\" on aid requested by the United Nations.\nIsrael said it would allow two truckloads of fuel a day at the request of Washington to help the United Nations meet basic needs, and spoke of plans to increase aid more broadly.\n\"We will increase the capacity of the humanitarian convoys and trucks as long as there is a need,\" Colonel Elad Goren, from COGAT, the ministry of defence agency that coordinates administrative issues with the Palestinians, told a briefing.\nWhile Israel has promised to allow in aid in the past, the remarks appeared to signal a shift in tone after U.N. agencies warned that humanitarian conditions in Gaza were rapidly deteriorating, including a stark warning from the World Food Programme of the \"immediate possibility of starvation\".\nAt Gaza's biggest hospital, Al Shifa, Israel said its forces had found in two days of searching a vehicle with a large number of weapons and an underground structure it called a Hamas tunnel shaft.\nThe facility has been a primary target of Israel's ground assault and a focus of international alarm over the deepening humanitarian crisis.\nThe army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of the hospital, littered with concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.\nIsrael has long maintained that the hospital sat above a vast underground bunker housing a Hamas command headquarters. Hospital staff say this is false and that Israel's findings there have so far established no such thing.\nHamas denies using hospitals for military purposes. It says some hostages have received treatment at medical centres but they have not been held inside them.\nBABY, HOSTAGE DIE\nAl Shifa staff said a premature baby died at the hospital on Friday, the first baby to die there in the two days since Israeli forces entered. Three had died in the previous days while the hospital was surrounded.\nHamas also announced the death of a captive from Israel, an 85-year-old it said died of a panic attack during an air strike.\nIn Modiin, Israel, family held a funeral for Noa Marciano, 19, an Israeli army conscript whose body was recovered from Gaza City near Shifa hospital on Thursday. She had been abducted from a military base during the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught.\nThe military said it had also recovered the body of Yehudit Weiss, 65, a mother of five who was seized from Kibbutz Be\u2019eri.\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi, James Mackenzie Henriette Chacar and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Jonathan Landay; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

        "text": "\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 The billionaire Haslam family says in a lawsuit that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are trying to artificially depress the price the company is obligated to pay for the family's remaining 20% stake in the Pilot Travel Centers truck stop chain that Jim Haslam founded.\nBerkshire has paid nearly $11 billion since 2017 for the first 80% of Pilot.\nBerkshire changed the accounting practices at Pilot this year after it acquired control of the company. The lawsuit that was unsealed Thursday said that change is artificially depressing Pilot's reported earnings, which are used to set the purchase price Berkshire agreed to pay in 2017.\n\u201cBerkshire is intent on using the accounting change to justify grossly underpaying Pilot (the Haslam family) for its 20% interest,\" the lawsuit said.\nThe Haslam family, which includes Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, declined to comment beyond the lawsuit.\nThe redacted lawsuit didn't reveal how much the Haslam's believe they could lose because those figures were withheld from the document. But the family did say Berkshire estimated its stake would be worth $3.2 billion without the accounting change.\nBuffett didn't respond to questions about the dispute that were emailed to his assistant on Friday.\nPilot's Chief Legal Counsel Kristin Seabrook said in a prepared statement that this dispute isn't related to the operation of the nation's largest network of truck stops that has more than 850 locations and roughly 30,000 employees in the United States and Canada.\n\u201cThis legal dispute is limited to a narrow issue between owners and is in no way related to the management or day-to-day operations of Pilot Company,\" Seabrook said.\nBerkshire is known for largely letting its businesses run themselves and holding onto nearly every business it buys forever. The Haslams said their respect for Buffett and his conglomerate was a big part of why Berkshire was the only buyer they considered. In a somewhat unusual move, Berkshire installed a new CEO at Pilot after it took over this year and made the accounting change at the heart of this dispute.\nThe truck stops provided a meaningful boost to Berkshire's revenue and profits this year.\nBerkshire's decision to shift to something called \u201cpushdown accounting\u201d this year forced Pilot to take on higher depreciation and amortization costs and that resulted in lower net income, according to the lawsuit.\nThe Haslams tried unsuccessfully to argue at Pilot board meetings that the company shouldn't make that change or at least that the new accounting method shouldn't be used to determine the value of their stake, but they were outvoted by the five Berkshire members of the board.\nSo the elder Haslam appealed directly to Buffett, but the lawsuit says that all the revered investor would say is to reiterate that Berkshire will comply with the terms of the contract they all signed in 2017.\nAs part of that deal, Berkshire bought 38.6% of Pilot in 2017 for $2.758 billion before more than doubling that to 80% this year for an additional $8.2 billion. Buffett told Berkshire shareholders this spring that he wishes he could have bought the entire company at once because the price was better in 2017, but the Haslams wouldn't sell it all then.\n\u201cThe first stage we bought at what turned out to be a very attractive price,\" Buffett said at the meeting. \"The second stage turned out to be a very good year for the diesel business, which means that the seller got a very good price.\u201d\nThe Haslam's have the option once a year to decide whether they want to sell their remaining stake. The family asked the court to intervene and force Pilot to revert to the accounting method it used to use before they have to make that decision early next year.",

        "text": "\n(Updates with release of hostages)\nNov 25 (Reuters) - Hamas fighters released a first wave of 13 Israeli women and children on Friday under a truce deal and also released 11 farm workers from Thailand and the Philippines, after guns fell silent across the Gaza Strip for the first time in seven weeks.\nHere is what we know about the hostages.\nWHO ARE THE HOSTAGES?\nGunmen from Palestinian group Hamas took about 240 hostages and killed 1,200 people when they raided Israel on Oct. 7, according to the Israeli government. The hostages were from communities, including collective farms, called kibbutzim and military bases in southern Israel as well as people attending an outdoor music festival.\nIn addition to Israeli citizens, more than half the hostages held foreign and dual citizenship from some 40 countries including the U.S., Thailand, Britain, France, Argentina, Germany, Chile, Spain and Portugal, Israel's government has said.\nAccording to Israeli media and the Israeli government, up to 40 hostages were children, including a 10-month-old baby and pre-schoolers.\nAlso among those taken were soldiers, elderly people and people with disabilities.\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE HOSTAGES?\nHamas has to date released 28 hostages under the terms of a temporary truce deal. On Friday, 24 hostages were handed over at the Rafah border crossing - 13 Israelis, plus 10 Thais and a Filipino. The Israeli hostages included four children and their mothers, and five elderly women.\nBefore the deal was struck, Hamas had released four captives: U.S. citizens Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, 17, on Oct. 20, citing \"humanitarian reasons,\" and Israeli women Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, on Oct. 23.\nIsraeli forces freed one hostage, Ori Megidish, a soldier, in their ground invasion of Gaza on Oct. 30.\nThe Israeli military said earlier this month that it recovered the bodies of two hostages in Gaza City, including 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano.\nThe armed wing of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, which participated in the Oct. 7 raid with Hamas, announced late on Tuesday the death of another Israeli hostage but did not identify the individual.\nWHERE ARE THE HOSTAGES BEING HELD?\nHamas has said it has hidden the captives in \"safe places and tunnels\" in Gaza. Israel says the group has a vast underground network where it stores weapons, commands operations and uses tunnels to move its fighters.\nLifshitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was freed by Hamas, said that after she was seized, she was taken into underground tunnels that she compared to a spider web.\nThe Israeli military has said it found evidence that some hostages were held at or under hospitals.\nThe Israel Defence Forces said on Sunday that Marciano, the soldier whose body was recovered, was killed by Hamas within Al Shifa hospital. The military released video that it said also showed militants forcing two hostages into Shifa hospital on Oct. 7.\nWHAT HAVE CONDITIONS BEEN LIKE FOR HOSTAGES?\nLifshitz said her captors separated hostages into small groups. She said she and a few others with her slept on mattresses on the floor of the tunnels.

        "text": "\n(Corrects spelling to Samy from Sami in paragraph 6)\nBy Amanda Cooper\nLONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Global stocks steadied on Tuesday, underpinned by the conviction among investors that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates again, which kept the dollar at three-month lows and supported gold above $2,000 an ounce.\nTraders will have to weigh up data this week on how the U.S. economy fared in the third quarter, along with a key read of consumer inflation and spending - both of which could be instrumental in setting expectations for the timing of the first rate cut.\nThe MSCI All-World index was last unchanged on the day, still heading for its best month in three years, up 8.5% in November. The dollar, which has lost 3.2% in value against a basket of currencies this month, was also flat, around its lowest in three months.\nEuropean stocks fell 0.6%, driven by losses in pharma and consumer goods companies, while U.S. stock futures fell 0.1%.\nThe spotlight this week will be on Thursday's U.S. October personal consumption expenditures report (PCE), which includes core PCE, said to be the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, and euro zone consumer inflation figures - giving further clarity on where prices and monetary policy are headed.\nU.S. consumer inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), is running at a rate of 3.2%, having dropped from September's 3.7%, and core PCE, at 3.7% in September, is unlikely to buck that trend. What might give traders more pause for thought is the spending component of the PCE report, according to Lombard Odier economist Samy Chaar.\n\"That is important because, basically, the market is totally anchored in that 'soft landing' type scenario, where disinflation continues, with slow growth, allowing the Fed to cut four times next year starting March. That is a very complacent scenario,\" he said.\n\"Everything has to go great and in the Fed\u2019s direction for this scenario to actually materialise and play out. So the spending data is where we get some new information,\" he said.\nThe resilience of the U.S. consumer, thanks in part to a strong labour market, has helped the United States outperform most other developed economies in the past year.\nFutures markets show traders expect U.S. rates to stay where they are at 5.25-5.50%, with a small chance of a first cut by March and at least three subsequent cuts that would take rates closer to 4.25-4.5% by the end of 2024.\nGold traders will also keep a close eye on the U.S. inflation numbers. The price is at six-month highs above $2,000, driven by a weaker dollar and lower Treasury yields.\nPolicymakers at a number of central banks have reiterated their commitment to keeping interest rates high enough to bring down inflation towards their targets.\nEuro zone inflation data this week will keep that debate alive in European markets.\nNO LET-UP IN INFLATION FIGHT\nOn Monday, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the central bank's fight to contain price growth was not over, citing persistently strong wage growth and an uncertain outlook even as inflation pressures in euro zone ease.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell also speaks on Friday and traders will be watching to gauge where rates may head.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury yields, which have dropped by the most in a month since March in November, were up 2 basis points at 4.41%, surrendering some price gains after data on Monday showed new home sales fell more than expected in October as higher mortgage rates reduced affordability.\nShorter-dated yields were a touch higher, following auctions on Monday for over $100 billion in new supply of two- and five-year notes.\nIn currencies, the Japanese yen, which often tracks U.S. yields, strengthened, leaving the dollar 0.1% down at 148.44, while the euro was flat at $1.0956.\nWith the dollar trading a touch softer on the day, the oil price rose, with Brent crude up 1.1% at $80.83 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures rose 1.1% to $75.68.\nVolatility in the oil market has been stirred up this week by Thursday's meeting of the OPEC+ group of major exporters to discuss production targets.\n\"The Saudis and OPEC+ have made a habit of surprising markets in recent years when it comes to their meetings. However, with aggressive cuts already in place, it does leave one wondering the degree to which the group could surprise the market with deeper-than-expected cuts,\" ING strategist Warren Patterson said.\nMeanwhile, gold was up 0.1% at $2,014 an ounce.\n(Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee Editing by Sam Holmes, Kim Coghill,Ed Osmond and Frances Kerry)",

The index was up 0.4% for the week.\n\"This time of the month there are month-end flows that tend to predominate at certain points,\" Bipan Rai, North America head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets, said. \"I would expect some of that is reflected in the price action that we are seeing for the dollar today.\"\nFollowing big gains for the July-September period the dollar has struggled to make further advances despite relatively upbeat U.S. economic data, Rai noted.\n\"We have seen some signals, at least in the near term, that the dollar is a bit overbought,\" said Rai, who still expects the dollar to remain strong.\nForex moves were muted ahead of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan policy meetings next week.\n\"Additional positioning doesn't really make sense until those two key risk events are out of the way,\" Rai said.\nCooling inflation will likely keep the Fed on pause in coming months, traders bet on Friday, even as persistent underlying price pressures amid strong consumer spending kept some chance of a rate hike later this year in play.\nThe U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the third quarter, data on Thursday showed, as higher wages from a tight labour market helped power consumer spending.\nThe European Central Bank on Thursday left interest rates unchanged as expected, ending an unprecedented streak of 10 consecutive rate hikes.\nThe euro was\n0.12\n% higher at $\n1.0573\non Friday.\nData earlier this week showed euro zone business activity took a surprise turn for the worse this month.\nOverall risk sentiment improved a little on Friday with the Australian dollar, often used as a proxy for risk appetite, climbing\n0.25\n% to $\n0.6338\n, having slid to a one-year low of $0.6271 on Thursday.\nThe yen pulled back from 150 per dollar, a level some have seen as a potential trigger for intervention by Japanese authorities.\nDollar/yen was\n0.6\n% lower at\n149.515\n.\nJapan will continue to respond to the currency market \"with a strong sense of urgency,\" Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told reporters on Friday.\nThe BOJ meets next week and speculation is mounting that the central bank could change its policy on bond-yield control. An increase to an existing limit on yields set just three months ago has been discussed as a possibility.\n\"There is next to no expectation in the market that the BOJ will attempt to move away from its negative policy rate at its Oct. 31 meeting,\" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank, in a note.\n\"By contrast, the market is split on the prospects of another tweak to yield curve control.\"\nIn cryptocurrency markets, bitcoin slipped\n1.7\n% to $\n33,584\n. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap has advanced sharply in recent sessions, helped by speculation that an exchange-traded bitcoin fund is imminent.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper London, Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by David Holmes, Mike Harrison and Richard Chang)",

        "text": "\nBy Howard Schneider\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A recent surge in U.S. productivity has underscored Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's emerging narrative for how inflation may continue to decline even amidst sustained job and economic growth.\nThe best-of-both-worlds outcome would rely on the U.S. finding a new balance between the demand for and the supply of goods and services less by \"destroying\" demand - the way Fed interest rate increases typically play out - and more through improvements in the economy's capacity.\nIn what has been a somewhat unheralded surprise, that is what has been unfolding through both improvements in the number of people willing to work, including new immigrants, and also through improvements in how much each worker produces, a dynamic that lowers effective labor costs even if wages are higher.\nNew data released Wednesday showed productivity grew an outsized 4.7% in the third quarter, the largest increase in three years and the second large gain this year. That caused unit labor costs to fall at a 0.8% annualized rate.\nThe net result is higher potential output with less inflationary risk, something Powell pointed to on Wednesday in his most extensive comments to date on the possibility that for the moment at least the economy may have an enhanced ability to grow, add jobs, and raise wages without adding to inflation.\nThe October employment report due on Friday at 8:30 EDT (1230 GMT) will provide updated estimates of the size of the labor force, a critical piece of the puzzle. After stalling through much of 2022, the workforce grew by 3 million workers, or about 2%, in the nine months through September.\nThe dynamic is one reason why the Fed kept its policy interest rate on hold at 5.25%-5.50% at its meeting this week despite recent data showing the economy grew at a 4.9% annualized rate in the third quarter - far beyond the 1.8% rate Fed officials see as the underlying long-term, noninflationary trend.\nThroughout the pandemic era growth has largely exceeded that rate even as inflation has continued to fall, and Powell at his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday tried to square the circle.\n\"People think trend growth over a long period of time is a little less than 2%,\" Powell said. But \"potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level...you're seeing actually elevated potential growth, catch up growth, that can happen\" because of improvements in things like labor supply that, all things equal, allow the economy to grow faster without the same price pressures. Along with more people working, productivity adds a boost as well.\nCAN IT LAST?\nHigher potential growth provides more leeway for the economy to grow without the Fed worrying about the impact on prices. In other words, it offers a wider runway for the \"soft landing\" Fed officials have hoped to engineer with inflation falling but the economy largely left on track.\nRising productivity \"signals receding inflationary pressure even as the economy continues to display notable resilience,\" said EY Senior Economist Lydia Boussour. \"If companies can generate strong productivity growth, they will not be so inclined to pass elevated input costs onto consumers.\"\nThe Fed's situation mimics in some ways the mid-1990s, when Alan Greenspan - the central bank's chief at the time - resisted pressure to raise interest rates, arguing that rising productivity would let the economy grow with less inflation, an insight credited with keeping that decade's strong economic performance on track.\nThe spread of Web-based technologies was still in its relative infancy then, and the years since have produced not only more tempered productivity numbers, but a generally dismal assessment that trend growth in output per worker hour was only around 1.5%. That, coupled with sluggish population growth, is the reason Fed officials in recent years have steadily downgraded their view of the long-term trend growth in overall economic output, with the median fixed at around 1.8% since 2016.\nPowell and his colleagues must now decide just how sustainable the recent improvements are.\nThe upside, as Powell described it, is the possibility of a virtuous cycle developing in which jobs remain plentiful, wages grow, and the economy continues to expand - all with a steady \"disinflation\" as the pace of price pressures fall back to 2%.\n\"The dynamic has been really strong job creation, with wages that are higher than inflation...and that raises real disposable income, that raises spending, which continues to drive more hiring,\" Powell said. \"It has been good. And the thing is, we've been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this.\n\"The question is, how long can that continue?\"\nIf and when it stops, the Fed may face the tougher choice of just how much the economy - the demand side at least - needs to slow to keep inflation in line.\n\"Growth is going to be slower this quarter...Higher rates are dampening activity here and there,\" wrote TSLombard Chief U.S. Economist Steven Blitz. But \"if real growth continues apace, disinflation runs its course and enough inflation eventually returns to pull the Fed back into a tightening cycle.\"\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Dan Burns and Andrea Ricci)",

The nights are very frightening, and so I wanted to get a license for a gun, to be safe, to protect my children,\" she said.\nAghast at the Hamas killing spree in their southern towns and villages, and worried by the military's slow response, Israelis are arming themselves in record numbers with the blessing of their government.\nGun stores and shooting ranges have been working overtime to accommodate the sudden demand, with some former advocates of stricter firearms controls among the new clients.\nIsrael has been bombarding the Gaza Strip since Hamas's attack on Israeli communities on Oct. 7, which it says killed some 1,400 people.\nOn Thursday it said its ground forces had made a big push into Gaza overnight to attack Hamas targets as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was still preparing for a ground invasion that could be one of several.\nAccording to Channel 13 TV, there have been 150,000 applications for gun licenses since the cross-border onslaught - compared to just 42 applications in the same period last year. Firearms sales are highly restricted in Israel, and obtaining a civilian firearms license is no easy feat. An application can sometimes take months.\nSome survivors of the rampage credit the guns they had near to hand, with which they said they defended their homes until security forces arrived - often after delays of several hours.\nThe far-right minister for police, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has also described private gun ownership as a precaution against any recurrence of the internal unrest between Israel's Arab minority and Jewish majority that accompanied the last Gaza war, in 2021.\nNetanyahu has said Israel was in an all-out war against Hamas. This included \"encouraging civilians and helping civilians to arm themselves for their self-defence,\" he said in a televised speech on Wednesday.\nThe gun licenses - usually for pistols, rather than rifles - once took months to process. They can now be obtained in just days online. Before, it was mostly veterans of military combat units or residents of frontline towns who qualified. Now a year of civilian national service can suffice, the police ministry says.\nArab citizens of Israel, many of whom identify as Palestinian, are generally exempted from mandatory conscription and may not be able to get a license.\nBefore Oct. 7, the Kfar Saba Shooting Range was holding just one training course per day, now they\u2019re holding three to four daily.\nGil Shemesh, a firearms instructor at the shooting range, said the swelling number of applicants has been overwhelming and includes \"people living in dangerous areas, to normal people who just want to protect themselves because they saw what happened.\"\nThe company is hiring new instructors just to keep up, he said.\nGun control advocates say making firearms too freely available raises the risk of accidental shootings, murder and suicide.\n\"An untrained response in the event of a subjective sense of danger is liable to bring about the needless death of innocents,\" said an Israeli advocate group called \"Pistol on the Kitchen Table\".\n(Writing by Dan Williams, editing by Deborah Kyvrikosaios)",

        "text": "\n(Refiles to correct French president's first name to Emmanuel instead of Francois, paragraph 20)\n*\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS:\n*\nHamas deputy head says no more exchanges without ceasefire\n*\nU.S. says it wants to see Gaza and West Bank unified\n*\nIsrael wants 'security envelope' around Gaza\nBy Suhaib Salem and Nidal al-Mughrabi\nGAZA, Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said too many innocent Palestinians had been killed in Gaza as Israeli war planes and artillery bombarded the enclave on Saturday following the collapse of a truce with Hamas militants.\nResidents feared the barrages presaged an Israeli ground operation in the south of the Palestinian territory that would pen them into a shrinking area and possibly try to push them across into Egypt.\nThe Gaza health ministry said at least 193 Palestinians had been killed since the truce ended on Friday, adding to the more than 15,000 Palestinian dead since the start of the war. Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas following its Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel in which it says 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage.\nSpeaking in Dubai, Harris said Israel had a right to defend itself, but international and humanitarian law must be respected and \"too many innocent Palestinians have been killed\".\n\"Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering, and the images and videos coming from Gaza, are devastating,\" Harris told reporters.\nShe also sketched out a U.S. vision for post-conflict Gaza, saying the international community must support recovery and Palestinian security forces must be strengthened.\n\"We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the center of this work,\" she said, adding that Hamas must no longer run Gaza.\nThe Western-backed Palestinian Authority governs parts of the occupied West Bank. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' mainstream Fatah party and has ruled the enclave ever since.\nIsrael has vowed to wipe out Hamas once and for all. The Iranian-backed Islamist group is sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction. One of its officials has said Hamas would repeat the Oct 7 attacks if possible.\nMark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel did not want to see Gaza's civilians caught in the crossfire.\nISRAEL SEEKS 'SECURITY ENVELOPE'\n\"Israel is targeting Hamas, a brutal terrorist organization that has committed the most horrific violence against innocent civilians. Israel is making a maximum effort to safeguard Gaza's civilians,\" Regev said.\nHe said that when the war was over, Israel would seek a \"security envelope\" with special zones and arrangements to prevent Hamas from being positioned on its border.\nThroughout Saturday morning, a steady stream of wounded people were carried into the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, some receiving treatment on the floor. Gaza health officials said 650 had been wounded since the truce collapsed.\nThe head of the International Committee of the Red Cross said the renewed fighting was intense.\n\"It's a new layer of destruction coming on top of massive, unparalleled destruction,\" Robert Mardini told Reuters in Dubai.\nWith conditions inside Gaza reaching \"breaking point\", in Mardini's words, the first aid trucks since the end of the truce entered from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, Egyptian security and Red Crescent sources said. Some 100 trucks passed through, carrying food, water and medical supplies, the sources said.\nA senior official said Israel would facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza's civilians.\nThe warring sides blamed each other for the collapse of the seven-day truce, during which Hamas had released hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.\nIsrael said it had recalled a team from Qatar, host of indirect negotiations with Hamas, accusing the Palestinian faction of reneging on a deal to free all the women and children it was holding.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said he was heading to Qatar to work on a new truce.\nThe deputy head of Hamas, however, said no prisoners would be exchanged with Israel unless there is a ceasefire and all Palestinian detainees in Israel are released.\nSaleh Al-Arouri told Al Jazeera TV that Israeli hostages held by Hamas are soldiers and civilian men who previously served in the army.\nBut Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas breached its commitment to free 17 women and children still held in Gaza and insisted that the militant group must keep its word.\nThe latest conflict broke out on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants burst through the Gaza border fence in an onslaught that killed mostly Israeli civilians.\nIsrael responded with a bombing campaign and a ground offensive in the north, destroying swathes of Gaza.\nSOUTH TARGETED\nThe southern part of Gaza including Khan Younis and Rafah was being pounded on Saturday. Residents said houses had been hit and three mosques destroyed in Khan Younis. Columns of smoke rose into the sky.\nDisplaced Gazans have been sheltering in Khan Younis and Rafah because of fighting in the north, but residents said they feared Israeli troops were preparing to move south.\nPalestinian witnesses said Israeli tanks had taken up positions near the road between Khan Younis and Deir Al-Balah.\nYamen, who gave only his first name, fled to Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza from the north after Israel destroyed several districts there.\n\"Where to after Deir Al-Balah, after Khan Younis? I don't know where I would take my wife and six children.\"\nOn Saturday morning, Israeli air strikes hit areas close to the Nasser Hospital six times, medics and witnesses said.\nThe hospital is filled with thousands of displaced and hundreds of wounded, including many of those who had been evacuated from north Gaza hospitals.\n\"A night of horror,\" said Samira, a mother of four. \"It was one of the worst nights we spent in Khan Younis in the past six weeks since we arrived here ... We are so afraid they will enter Khan Younis.\"\nAmong the dead on Saturday was the president of the territory's Islamic University, a theoretical physicist and applied mathematician killed with his family when a house was bombed, health officials said.\nMILITANT TARGETS\nThe Israeli military said that in the space of 24 hours its ground, air and naval forces had hit 400 militant targets and killed an unspecified number of Hamas fighters.\nThese included many in northern Gaza, some in a gun battle at a mosque used by Islamic Jihad militants as a command post.\nHamas said its forces had killed and injured a number of Israeli soldiers in northern Gaza.\nLeaflets dropped by Israel on eastern areas of Khan Younis ordered residents of four towns to evacuate further south to Rafah.\nReuters could not confirm the battlefield accounts.\n(Reporting by Suhaib Salem in Gaza, Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo; additional reporting by Mohammed Salem and Roleen Tafakji in Gaza, Ari Rabinovich and Emily Rose in Jerusalem, Andrew Mills in Doha, Nandita Bose and Steve Holland in Dubai; Writing by Angus MacSwan, Giles Elgood and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Alison Williams)",

It also said that a Barcelona property she bought in May 2012 served as a family home.\n\"It is logically a ruling of conformity that involves a recognition of the facts. But the decision has been motivated by personal issues,\" Miriam Company, one of Shakira's lawyers, told reporters outside the courthouse.\nShe said the legal team was convinced it could prove Shakira's innocence but that the circumstances had changed.\nShakira, 46, lived with former Barcelona and Spain soccer star Gerard Pique for 11 years and the couple have two children. The singer, whose full name is Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, moved to Miami after their separation.\nSpanish authorities have pursued other major celebrities over tax evasion, including soccer players such as Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, Argentina's Lionel Messi and Brazilian-Spanish player Diego Costa. All settled and paid large fines.\nBayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso refused to settle and eventually won a trial against the tax agency. Spain's Supreme Court last month upheld his acquittal.\n($1 = 0.9211 euros) (Writing by Emma Pinedo and Joan Faus; Editing by Aislinn Laing, Inti Landauro, Alexander Smith and Bernadette Baum)",

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration is launching a multi-agency effort to encourage states and cities to convert more empty office buildings into housing units, with billions of federal dollars available to help spur such transitions.\nThe new initiative, announced Friday morning, involves the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Transportation, along with the General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget in a multi-pronged effort to address both the national shortage of affordable housing and the post-pandemic surplus of vacant office buildings.\n\u201cThis presents an area of opportunity to both increase housing supply while revitalizing main streets. It's a win-win,\u201d said Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council. \u201cWe're utilizing resources from across the government.\u201d\nSeveral of the new measures will be designed to specifically encourage the creation of new affordable housing units near transportation hubs like bus terminals and subway stations. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said his department will issue new guidance to states and municipalities on how to access funding through a pair of federal programs \u2014 the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act and Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing.\nButtigieg said that \u201cover $35 billion in lending capacity\u201d will be made available to provide below-market rate loans to finance both new housing construction and office conversions near transportation hubs.\n\u201cThese downtowns and central business districts .. are already designed and oriented around public transit,\u201d Buttigieg said. \"Our intention is to make the most of this opportunity to add more housing near transit in ways that not only reduce the cost of housing but also reduce the cost of transportation.\u201d\nThe Department of Transportation is also releasing new guidance to make it easier for transit agencies to transfer unused properties or buildings to local governments or nonprofit organizations for conversion into affordable housing. Buttigieg said buildings \u201clike an underutilized storage facility\u201d could also be transferred to private developers at below-market prices, provided that those developers commit to including a negotiated percentage of affordable housing units.\nIn addition, the GSA will work with the Office of Management and Budget to identify surplus federal properties that could similarly be transferred for development into affordable housing units.\nThe White House is also releasing a Commercial to Residential Federal Resources Guidebook with over 20 federal programs across six federal agencies that can be used to support conversions. These programs include low-interest loans, loan guarantees, grants and tax incentives for developers.\nCities across the country have struggled to cope with half-empty downtown business districts. Many businesses have embraced a hybrid work from home model with employees coming to the office two or three days a week.\n\u201cThe pandemic really changed the patterns of how many Americans live and work,\u201d Buttigieg said.\nWith fewer employees working from the office, many businesses have abandoned large offices, leaving some downtown property owners struggling with half-empty buildings and city governments struggling with shrinking tax revenue.\nThe trend may actually be continuing even after the end of the pandemic, as businesses are waiting until long-term leases expire and then drastically shrinking the amount of floorspace they occupy. Multiple municipal governments have embraced the idea of office-to-housing conversions, offering tax incentives to developers to help subsidize the often-prohibitive costs of such changes.\nDeputy HUD Secretary Adrianne Todman said the new package of initiatives is designed to \u201creally supercharge\u201d that office-to-housing conversion effort across the country.",

Meanwhile in Washington, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in prepared remarks that he\u2019s \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d that monetary policy is tight enough to reduce inflation.

The move emphasizes traders\u2019 enduring uncertainty over whether Saudi Arabia will extend production cuts as initially expected, he added.\nThe group is heading into the meeting with prices having dropped by about a fifth since late September due to plentiful supplies and concerns about the global economy.

It\u2019s taking place as Putin asserts Russian \u201csovereignty\u201d against the US and its allies ahead of a likely declaration he\u2019ll run for a fifth presidential term in March elections.\nGerman airport operator Fraport, the Qatar Investment Authority, and Russia\u2019s VTB Bank each hold about 25% of Pulkovo\u2019s concession. The remainder is controlled by a consortium of investors including Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, RDIF, Mubadala and Baring Vostok, according to the Interfax news service.\nPutin told the government to create a new management body for the operator of Pulkovo, which is Russia\u2019s busiest airport after Domodedovo in Moscow and served 17.5 million passengers through October this year. St. Petersburg also has a military airport, Levashovo.\nWhile Germany is viewed as \u201cunfriendly\u201d by the Kremlin, Qatar and Abu Dhabi are not. Putin\u2019s decree potentially left open the door for the Middle East investors to regain their voting rights by saying stakeholders could restore them \u201cupon their application, subject to the conclusion of corporate agreements with other participants in the company and upon the assumption of obligations to comply with Russian legislation.\u201d\nThe order on Pulkovo relied on laws signed long before Putin\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and was based on a \u201cthreat to the national interests and economic security of the Russian Federation resulting from the violation of obligations by certain foreign legal entities.\u201d\nThat differed from earlier Kremlin takeovers of the local operations of international holdings, which were based on legislation Putin signed in April that allowed Russia to impose temporary state control over the assets of companies or individuals from \u201cunfriendly states.\u201d\nIt seized Russian plants owned by Danone SA and Carlsberg A/S in July and installed allies of Putin to run them. Russia also took control of utilities owned by Finland\u2019s Fortum Oyj and Germany\u2019s Uniper SE.\nFraport is evaluating the consequences of the Kremlin\u2019s decision, a spokesman said. The company has already written down the value of the holding to zero following the attack on Ukraine, and there\u2019s been no interaction with Russia or any transfer of money in either direction since then, he said.\nQIA and Mubadala declined to comment.\nPulkovo airport welcomed Putin\u2019s order, saying it would \u201crestore corporate governance mechanisms,\u201d RIA Novosti reported, citing the company\u2019s statement.\n--With assistance from Benedikt Kammel and Nicolas Parasie.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAnduril Builds a Tiny, Reusable Fighter Jet That Blows Up Drones\nB-School Admissions Deans Are Feeling The Pressure From Falling Applications\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

It said on Sunday it considered the board's decision \"unlawful\", adding it would use \"any legal means at its disposal to challenge\" it.\nIn Vivendi's view, the sale required an extraordinary shareholder vote. Vivendi also wanted clearance from an internal TIM board committee for related party transactions, given the Treasury's double role as owner of TIM shareholder CDP and investor in the grid.\nTIM on Sunday also dismissed as not in line with its strategy an alternative plan pitched in recent weeks by London-based investment firm Merlyn Advisors, which Vivendi had called on the board to assess.\n\"Merlyn ... reserves the right to take any steps to bring the board to call ... a shareholder meeting to decide whether the plan approved on Sunday is what shareholders want,\" Merlyn said in a note.\nTIM worked with advisers Goldman Sachs, Mediobanca and Vitale & Co as well as law firm Gatti Pavesi Bianchi Ludovici. Citi, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan advised KKR. UBS worked with the Treasury.\nEquita, Lion Tree and Studio Carbonetti supported TIM's independent directors.

December 2024 is the target for a test flight, with ambitions to start commercial service four years later, Shin said in an interview this week with Bloomberg News in Singapore.\n\u201cConsidering all the battery technology and all the infrastructure and regulation to come along, it\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d he said.\nBatteries are the biggest technical challenge for electric air mobility, accounting for up to 40% of an eVTOL craft\u2019s weight. \u201cThat\u2019s really the killer,\u201d Shin said.\n\u201cFrom the operation side, we don\u2019t have air traffic management systems to govern these vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cUp until this point, even the foreseeable future, we don\u2019t have man-made objects flying routinely below 500 meters.\u201d\nNext Steps\nWashington, DC-based Supernal will submit an application to the US Federal Aviation Administration in the coming months to get the eVTOL certified. Given how young the industry is, companies and regulators need to collaborate to figure out the best paths forward, Shin said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing out there \u2014 no infrastructure, no policy, no regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cSince it\u2019s so brand new, the FAA doesn\u2019t have an established certification method.\u201d\nHyundai already has a factory producing cars in Alabama, while affiliate Kia Corp. has a plant in Georgia. Shin didn\u2019t provide investment figures for the planned Supernal plant, or its size, potential location or other details.\nSupernal joins an increasingly crowded field of companies trying to get eVTOL vehicles certified. EHang Holdings Ltd. is a step ahead after receiving a certificate to begin trial aerial operations in China, while California-based Joby Aviation Inc., with backers including Delta Air Lines Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp., also has approval from the FAA to test its flying taxis.\nRacing to catch up, Supernal opened a new engineering headquarters in Irvine, California, in July and a new R&D facility in Fremont two months later. Its workforce has doubled from last year to nearly 600, with many coming from Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Tesla Inc., according to Shin.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to hire more because we\u2019re going start the flight testing next year,\u201d he said.\nIn the two years since Supernal was founded, Hyundai, Kia and Hyundai Mobis Co. have invested about 1.2 trillion won ($920 million) into the company, filings show. With funding coming from Hyundai, Supernal doesn\u2019t plan an initial public offering, Shin said.\nThe company last month also signed an agreement with Korean Air to work together on air mobility for the South Korean market. Speaking at an aviation conference in Singapore on Tuesday, the airline\u2019s CEO Walter Cho said vertical mobility vehicles will likely first be used to carry cargo and then evolve.\n\u201cI have to be confident enough to get on it myself,\u201d Cho said.\nEvolution of eVTOL Aircraft\nFor transporting people, air mobility craft such as eVTOL taxis will initially be limited to \u201cvery progressive cities,\u201d but they have the potential to spread rapidly once the public becomes more comfortable and familiar with them, similar to how people adapted to mobile phones and elevators, Shin said.\n\u201cThe inflection point will come real fast,\u201d he said.\nHyundai\u2019s mass-production know-how puts Supernal in a strong position as demand for alternative public transport increases with more people moving to urban areas, Shin added. \u201cAll of a sudden, the world market will demand hundreds of thousands of these vehicles, then you have to be able to produce.\u201d\nThe United Nations says 70% of the global population will live in cities by 2030.\n\u201cUrbanization is happening like crazy everywhere,\u201d Shin said.\nBut with work still needed to be done on battery technology and regulation, 2028 is the \u201cright timing\u201d to aim for a commercial launch.\n--With assistance from Danny Lee and Emily Yamamoto.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nMarvel\u2019s Latest Movie Will Show If Superheroes Ever Get Tired\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

It contracted to 17.9% between July and September from 25.1% a year earlier due the EV maker's rampant price cuts, which also triggered a price war in key markets such as China.\nTesla was trading at about 56 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with 5.6 times for Ford and General Motors' 4.1, according to LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

The plant near Charlotte is doubling its capacity due to increased demand for electric vehicles spurred by consumer tax credits of up $7,500 approved in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\nIn excerpts of remarks to be delivered at the plant, Yellen said similar investments were taking place across the country, with $614 billion worth of clean energy investments and manufacturing projects announced since the Biden administration took office in 2021. These include $142 billion in EVs and batteries and $71 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and she attributed much of the investment to tax credits in the inflation reduction act.\n\"We're seeing the emergence of a battery belt across the Midwest and South,\" Yellen said, adding that this would bolster U.S. energy security reducing American dependence on China's EV battery supply chain.\nThe Biden administration in coming days is expected to release new guidance on the levels of Chinese content that EV batteries can have and still qualify for IRA tax credits. The Livent plant processes lithium brine largely from Argentina and Canada.\nYellen said the bulk of investments spurred by the legislation was flowing to counties with below-average college graduation rates, providing good jobs \"where they are most needed.\"\nSTRONG GROWTH, LITTLE CREDIT\nIncreased investment in new manufacturing projects, machinery and warehouses, which also include new semiconductor plants, helped the U.S. economy to grow at a torrid 5.2% annual pace in the third quarter, defying predictions earlier this year that it was headed for a recession.\nBut Biden has struggled to win voter confidence in his handling of the economy, with polls earlier this month showing Republican frontrunner Donald Trump ahead in five of the six most important battleground states.\nVoters remain deeply scarred by the higher living costs brought about by post-pandemic inflation, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. It will take time for this to fade and for people to feel the benefits of higher wages, he added.\n\"People are hearing that things are getting much better, inflation is coming down and we're not coming into a recession,\" Sabato said. \"But in their lives every week, when they go to the gas station or into the grocery store, they still perceive higher prices, and their minds are oriented to bad news. And people are going to blame the president.\" (Reporting by David Lawder and Howard Schneider; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",

The EU-wide platform now has almost 3 million vacancies, a vivid illustration of how third-country nationals could profit.\nOn top of the platforms, the plan calls for measures to cut red tape when it comes to professional qualifications so that job seekers should not be held back for months and years because of diverging paperwork.\nThe plans will now be assessed by the 27 member states and the EU's parliament before they can be turned into reality.\nIn the meantime, the issue gets mixed up in the overall European debate on migration, where labor concerns often get short shrift in a shrill debate that often spills over into raw racism. The theme will also be key in next Wednesday's parliamentary elections in the Netherlands.\nEconomically too, the urgency is there, and EU businesses realize they are facing competitors across the globe.\n\u201cEurope is engaged in a global race for talent, the same way that we are fighting a global race for raw materials or energy,\u201d Schinas said, mentioning the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia as prime rivals.\nSuch is the need that even the EU's economic juggernaut, Germany, is looking for some extraordinary measures. Two weeks ago, the government approved legislation that would allow asylum-seekers to start working earlier even if their situation has not fully been settled.\nThe German package still requires parliamentary approval and is the latest in a series of steps taken recently by the government as it tries to defuse migration as a major political problem. The issue was one of several that led to a poor showing in state elections last month for Chancellor OIaf Scholz\u2019s quarrelsome three-party coalition and gains for a far-right party.\nSchinas had no doubt the battle with the far-right would continue.\n\u201cWe will continue to oppose this populist discourse that Europe is either incapable of doing anything on migration, or opening the floodgates we are not doing either. We are working for a regulatory solution long term,\u201d he said.",

In August, four miners were killed after a fire erupted at the same mine, while five people died following a methane leak at another site in November 2022.\nThe company confirmed Saturday that it was finalizing a deal with the Kazakh government to nationalize the firm amid growing discontent from officials.\nPrime Minister Alikhan Smailov said in a statement on the Kazakh president\u2019s website the government had reached a preliminary agreement with the company's shareholders and was now in the process of \u201cformalizing\u201d the nationalization.\nSpeculation around the company's future had been growing since September, when Kazakhstan\u2019s first deputy prime minister, Roman Sklyar, told journalists that the government had started talks with potential investors to buy out ArcelorMittal after becoming increasingly unhappy with its failure to meet investment obligations and repeated worker safety violations.\nSpeaking on Saturday, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced Oct. 29 as a national day of mourning in Kazakhstan. The office of the country\u2019s Prosecutor General has also said it was starting an investigation into potential safety violations in the coal mine.\nIn a statement, ArcelorMittal Temirtau said that work had been halted at all of their coal mining sites in Kazakhstan. It also conveyed \u201cpain\u201d at the lives lost and said its efforts \u201care now aimed at ensuring that affected employees receive comprehensive care and rehabilitation, as well as close cooperation with government authorities.\u201d\nArcelorMittal Temirtau is the local representative for Luxembourg-based multinational ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s second-largest steel producer.\nBesides worker safety concerns, ArcelorMittal Temirtau has also fallen under scrutiny in recent years for its environmental violations.\nThe Kazakh city of Temirtau \u2014 the company\u2019s namesake and home of its steel plant \u2014 made global headlines in 2018 after being blanketed in black snow, a phenomenon that the company attributed to a lack of wind.\nIn November 2021, local residents also shared videos of the town carpeted in fine, magnetic dust.\nFollowing the November 2022 deaths, Tokayev said that more than 100 workers had died at ArcelorMittal sites in Kazakhstan since 2006.",

        "text": "\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Republicans floated changes Wednesday to a funding proposal for Milwaukee Brewers stadium repairs including a new tax on non-Brewers events, seeking to win over skeptics of the current plan intended to keep the team at American Family Field until at least 2050.\nA Brewers official testified at a state Senate hearing Wednesday that the team didn't want to leave the city, saying it didn't make sense to build a new stadium and that the priority was making urgent repairs extend the life of the 22-year-old ballpark.\n\u201cWe want to be here for the next generation,\" said Rick Schlesinger, president of business operations for the Brewers. \"The last thing I want to do is figure out a way to leave. ... I\u2019m not here threatening to leave. I want to be here.\u201d\nWhile the stadium funding plan cleared the Assembly with bipartisan support last week, it does not have a majority of Republican support yet in the Senate. It must pass both houses in identical form before it can be sent to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has voiced support for the current plan.\nMore changes may yet be needed to win over wary Senate Republicans, like increasing payments from the Brewers to decrease the state\u2019s contribution, said Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to try and get to 17,\u201d LeMahieu told reporters, referring to the number of Senate votes needed to pass the bill. \u201cI believe we can get there.\u201d\nRepublicans hold a 22-11 majority and LeMahieu said he hoped the measure would win bipartisan support in the Senate as it did in the Assembly.\nThe proposed tax on non-Brewers events and other changes are being discussed and may be introduced, bill co-sponsor Rep. Robert Brooks testified at a Senate committee hearing.\nSuch a tax would apply to all non-Brewers events, everything from monster truck rallies to George Strait concerts, Brooks said.\nTaxing Brewers games is a \u201cnon-starter\u201d with the team, which does support a ticket tax for non-Brewers events, Brooks said.\nThe ticket tax could offset the state's $411 million contribution, Brooks said. There's also talk of forming an advisory board that includes the Brewers and local governmental officials to look at development of land around the stadium, including parking lots, Brooks said.\nUnder the current plan, the city of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County would put forward a combined $135 million in addition to the state share. Milwaukee's leaders support the proposal, which calls for less money from the city and county than an earlier version. The Brewers would contribute $100 million and agree to extend their lease at the stadium through 2050.\nDemocratic Sen. Kelda Roys, of Madison, said she wanted to see the state's share decrease.\n\u201cEvery dollar that we\u2019re spending on the Brewers is money that can\u2019t go to our other priorities,\" she said.\nPublic funding for professional sports facilities is hotly debated across the country. The Brewer\u2019s principal owner, Mark Attanasio, has an estimated net worth of $700 million, according to Yahoo Finance. The team itself is valued at around $1.6 billion, according to Forbes.\nThe Brewers are pushing for renovations at 22-year-old American Family Field, arguing that glass outfield doors, seats and concourses should be replaced and that luxury suites and video scoreboards need upgrades. They said the stadium\u2019s signature retractable roof, fire suppression systems, parking lots, elevators and escalators need work, as well.\nUpgrades could include winterizing the stadium so it can host concerts, conventions and other sporting events throughout the year, said bill co-sponsor Republican Sen. Dan Feyen.\nLawmakers trying to broker a deal have warned that without one, the Brewers and the tax revenue they generate will leave the state.\nAccording to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, baseball operations at the stadium currently generate about $19.8 million annually in state and local taxes. That is expected to grow to $50.7 million annually by 2050, according to the fiscal bureau.\nAmerican Family Field opened in 2001 as Miller Park, replacing aging County Stadium. Construction cost about $392 million and was funded largely through a 0.1% sales tax imposed in Milwaukee County and four surrounding counties. The stadium was renamed American Family Field in 2021.",

The company plans to start a formal pitch early next year, said the people, who declined to be identified citing confidential information.\nThe new fund would be the largest ever for Everstone if it meets the target, even as private equity groups globally struggle to raise fresh funds amid soaring interest rates and slowing economic growth. Carlyle Group Inc.\u2019s top executive said this week he was not pleased with the pace of fundraising this year.\nIndia\u2019s not immune to the slowdown, with just $1.7 billion raised by buyout and venture funds in the first seven months of this year, down from a record $8.5 billion in 2022, according to data from Preqin Ltd.\n\u201cSo far, 2023 has been a tough year, with both deal-making and fundraising bearing the full brunt of these macroeconomic headwinds,\u201d Preqin said in a recent report.\nThe new fund would be more than three times bigger than its predecessor fund, Everstone Capital Partners IV, which collected about $300 million last year, the people said. Everstone refers to the fourth fund as an \u201cinterim\u201d or \u201cbridge\u201d fund as it waited for the macro-economic environment to improve for a larger fund, they said.\nEverstone declined to comment on its fundraising plans.\nThe firm, started by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives Sameer Sain and Atul Kapur in 2006, wrapped up its first fund with $425 million in 2006, followed by $580 million for a second fund in 2010 and $730 million for a third fund in 2016.\nInvestors in Everstone\u2019s prior funds include International Finance Corp., the World Bank\u2019s private-sector arm, which committed $60 million to the fourth fund.\nEverstone pivoted from taking minority stakes in businesses to taking control of firms from its second fund. Since its third, the company has been following a \u201cbuy and build\u201d model, which involves buying a mid-sized business and making acquisitions to help the business grow, the people said. The firm invests in digital tech services in India, along with healthcare, industrial, consumer and financial services companies.\nLast year, the firm acquired Cprime Inc., a US digital technology consulting and solutions company, alongside Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

        "text": "\nBy Tom Wilson\nLONDON(Reuters) - The Ethereum blockchain's historical greenhouse gas emissions before a major software upgrade last year were equivalent to the yearly emissions of Honduras, a University of Cambridge study showed on Friday.\nBlockchains - the digital ledgers that underpin cryptocurrencies - typically consume large amounts of energy as they produce coins and process transactions, drawing criticism from environmentalists and some investors.\nYet calculating the environmental impact of the crypto sector is fraught with difficulty, given its relative opacity and lack of centralised data.\nGlobal leaders and delegates from nearly 200 countries are gathering for the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, with how to maximise energy efficiency in industry among questions on the agenda.\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain - which hosts the world's second biggest token ether - underwent a major software upgrade known as the \"Merge,\" which drastically reduced its energy usage.\nFrom its launch in 2015 until the Merge, Ethereum's greenhouse gas emissions totalled 27.5 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), the study showed. Honduras emitted 27.7 MtCO2e in 2020, according to Climate Watch.\nUnder its post-Merge system, Ethereum uses over 99% less energy, developers say. Its current yearly emissions are around 2.8 kilotonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, the study found - around the same as five round-trip flights from London to New York.\nIt is generally thought that blockchain is \"a highly emitting technology,\" said Anna Lerner, executive director at the Ethereum Climate Platform, an organisation that seeks to use blockchain tech to accelerate climate finance. \"Ethereum has shown that it doesn't have to be such a polluter,\" she said.\nThe study is among the most thorough examinations of Ethereum's historical emissions, its author, Alexander Neumueller, research lead for digital assets climate impact at the University of Cambridge, told Reuters.\nBitcoin, in comparison, creates about 73.9 MtCO2e a year, Neumueller said, based on its daily emissions in November 2022.\nThe annual emissions of Bitcoin, the largest blockchain and cryptocurrency, are therefore roughly equivalent to those of Cambodia in 2020, according to Climate Watch.\nCrypto tokens such as bitcoin and ether remain primarily an investment tool, with little widespread practical usage in business or commerce.\n(Reporting by Tom Wilson; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)",

        "text": "\n(Adds details, analyst comments throughout, updates markets)\n*\nThird-quarter GDP increases at 4.9% rate\n*\nConsumer spending accelerates; business investment soft\n*\nInventory accumulation, government spending offer boost\nBy Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew almost 5% in the third quarter, again defying dire warnings of a recession, as higher wages from a tight labor market helped to fuel consumer spending and businesses restocked at a brisk clip to meet the strong demand.\nThe fastest growth pace in nearly two years reported by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday in its advance estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product was also spurred by a rebound in residential investment after contracting for nine straight quarters.\nGovernment spending picked up. But business investment dipped for the first time in two years as outlays on equipment like computers declined and the boost faded from the construction of factories related to a campaign by President Joe Biden's administration to encourage more semiconductor manufacturing in the United States.\nThough the blockbuster performance over the summer is likely not sustainable, it showcased the economy's stamina despite aggressive interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. Growth could slow in the fourth quarter because of the United Auto Workers strikes, the resumption of student loan repayments by millions of Americans and the lagged effects of the rate hikes.\nThe report also showed underlying inflation subsiding considerably last quarter. Most economists have revised their forecasts and now believe the Fed can engineer a \"soft-landing\" for the economy, citing expectations that the July-September period will show a continuation of second-quarter strength in worker productivity and moderation in unit labor costs.\n\"We've seen for a period of time now a post pandemic induced negative bias about an imminent recession and persistent inflation,\" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. \"But not only is the economy surprisingly resilient, we also got productivity-driven growth for two consecutive quarters in 2023, meaning the business cycle still looks very solid.\"\nGross domestic product increased at a 4.9% annualized rate last quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 4.3% rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the April-June quarter and is expanding at a pace well above what Fed officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%.\nGrowth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, accelerated at a 4.0% rate after only rising at a 0.8% pace in the second quarter. It added 2.69 percentage points to GDP growth, and was driven by spending on both goods and services.\nThough wage growth has slowed, it is rising a bit faster than inflation, lifting households' purchasing power.\nThe increase in wages last quarter was partially offset by a rise in personal taxes, resulting in income at the disposal of households after taxes falling at a 1.0% pace. That led to consumers tapping their savings to fund some of their spending. The saving rate dropped to 3.8% from 5.2% in the second quarter.\nStocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields dipped.\nSLOWDOWN AHEAD\nThe declining saving rate combined with the resumption of student loan repayments in October, which economists estimated was equal to roughly $70 billion, or around 0.3% of disposable personal income, could dent spending. Low-income consumers are increasingly relying on debt to fund purchases, with higher borrowing costs boosting credit card delinquencies.\nEconomists estimate that excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic are mostly concentrated among high-income households and will run out by the first quarter of 2024. Some economists see a sharp slowdown around the corner, a concern shared by United Parcel Service, which on Thursday cut its 2023 revenue forecast for the second straight quarter.\nBut others are not too worried, arguing that spending was not reliant on credit, but rather on the strong labor market and generous government transfers during the pandemic.\n\"It is too early to take slower growth for granted, especially after three quarters of consistently stronger-than-expected economic activity,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. \"Any economist working on an update of their estimate of when pandemic savings will run out needs to tear it up and start thinking about what has allowed consumption to remain so strong. It is not borrowing.\"\nLabor market resilience was highlighted by a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday, showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 during the week ending Oct. 21, staying in the very low end of their range of 194,000 to 265,000 for this year.\nThe number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 63,000 to 1.790 million for the week ended Oct. 14, the highest since early May. Economists were divided on whether this was a sign that the unemployed were experiencing longer spells of joblessness or reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations.\nInventory accumulation rose at an $80.6 billion pace last quarter, contributing 1.32 percentage points to GDP growth. Businesses relied on imports to restock, resulting in a small trade deficit that imposed a minor drag on GDP growth. Excluding inventories and trade, the economy grew at a solid 3.5% rate.\nThe GDP data likely has no impact on near-term monetary policy amid a surge in U.S. Treasury yields and a recent stock market selloff, which have tightened financial conditions.\nUnderlying price pressures abated further, with the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) excluding food and energy rising at a 2.4% rate. That was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2020 and followed a 3.7% pace of increase in the second quarter.\nThe so-called core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the Fed for its 2% target. The U.S. central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged next Wednesday. It has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25% to 5.50% range since March of last year.\n\"From the Fed perspective there is little here to suggest any need to start lowering rates, nor does this suggest an imminent need to raise them again either,\" said Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair in London.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Andrea Ricci and Chizu Nomiyama)",

        "text": "\nWith the ever-increasing cost of college and many students graduating with crippling student debt, more high school graduates are considering trade schools and other non-college options instead. Students can learn a specific occupation using a combination of classroom instruction and hands-on practice. Once they graduate, they often work under an experienced tradesperson as an apprentice, where they continue to learn the ins and outs of their chosen trade.\nHere Are: Best Banks for Early Direct Deposit\nAlso: All of the States That Will Pay Off Your Student Loans\nEven though apprenticeships are still technically a training period, the salaries can be eye-popping for the highest-demand jobs. Here are some apprenticeships where you can earn $100,000 a year \u2014 and make your student loan debt disappear.\nA degree in computer science isn\u2019t necessarily required for some software developer positions. Some \u201clow-code\u201d development platforms allow developers to create applications with minimal coding, and these are skills that can be learned under the guidance of an experienced developer. Candidates should have previous experience in coding and technical knowledge of databases and system integration.\nWhile an electrician apprentice won\u2019t typically earn $100,000 right out of trade school, those who have been apprentices for two or three years, and who choose to specialize in a specific type of electrical work, may find themselves at or above that pay grade. Union electricians typically earn more than those who work for independent electrical contractors.\nMany sales positions are commission-based, and this one is no different. Boat sales is a specialized market, however, and learning the business could lead to significant earnings over the course of a career. Sales apprenticeship programs typically provide training and sales coaching and also have lead generation programs to provide a steady stream of prospects.\nPlumber\u2019s apprentices install plumbing equipment and fixtures in new construction, and also repair and replace fixtures in existing buildings. As with many construction trades, union members often make more money and have better benefits than their non-union counterparts.\nResidential service estimators examine and assess existing homes to provide estimates to repair or replace items like windows, chimneys and fireplaces. There is sometimes a sales component to this job, with commissions being paid when the customer purchases replacement products or services.\nAn automotive technician apprentice learns to troubleshoot and repair automobiles under the guidance of an experienced technician. Some technicians are trained on certain makes of automobiles and may work for a dealership rather than an independent mechanic who works on many different makes of cars. Those technicians that are trained by the manufacturer may command a higher wage.\nThe workers who install, repair and replace utility lines start out as apprentices as they learn to install new utility service and restore service after storms and other natural disasters.\nReal estate agents are paid on commission, so it\u2019s possible to earn $100,000 per year or more if you live and work in an area of expensive homes where there is high demand. Some real estate brokerages will hire apprentices to learn from experienced brokers, and they have commission goals of $100,000 or more. Whether or not an apprentice can reach that goal depends on several factors, including their drive and sales ability.\nHair stylists and barbers just starting out can learn a lot from their more experienced colleagues. Apprentices may start by helping other stylists with things like shampooing, as they are learning more complicated cuts and color processes. Based on an hourly wage plus tips, a full-time hair stylist or barber could earn $100,000 per year depending on their clientele.\nSponsored: Open a new checking account and earn early paycheck access; up to 2 days early with Discover\u00ae Cashback Debit with Early Pay\nOne thing to note about the trades in general \u2014 and about apprenticeships, in particular \u2014 is that these are typically hourly wage positions. They may include benefits, like health insurance, a 401(k) and so on, but as an hourly worker, you are only paid when you work. (On the other hand, many apprenticeship and trade jobs pay extra for overtime, which is anything more than 40 hours in a week.) Tradespeople hired for a specific project will need to find another job when the project is complete and may have to go where the work is in order to consistently be employed.\nWhether you want to avoid having to take on student loans to finance a college education, or the idea of four more years of classroom learning simply doesn\u2019t appeal, perhaps an apprenticeship is for you.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nLiving Frugally: Adopting Lessons From the Great Depression\nThe Average Retirement Age in 2023 in the US vs Canada\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n7 Ways To Squeeze the Absolute Most Out of an Average Salary\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 9 Apprenticeships Where You\u2019ll Earn $100K a Year and Be Student Loan Free",

All three major averages closed the three-and-a-half days of trading up about 1%.\n\nBroadly, the week ahead will provide a test for the current market as stocks ended Friday pacing toward their best monthly gain in more than a year.\nThursday's inflation reading will offer a final chance for economic data to derail the current narrative bolstering stocks that the US economy may be headed for a \"soft landing,\" in which inflation retreats to the central bank's 2% target without a severe economic downturn.\nRead more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nRecent economic data has fallen in line with that path, sending beaten-up areas of the stock market like small-cap stocks and meme stocks into rally mode.\nThis data has pushed around expectations for the Fed too, with markets now pricing in just a 12% chance the Fed raises rates again, according to data from the CME Group.\nEconomists expect annual inflation according to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge \u2014 \"core\" PCE \u2014 clocked in at 3.5% in October. Over the prior month, economists expect \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%.\nIn a note to clients this month, JPMorgan's chief US economist Michael Feroli noted this 0.2% monthly rise \"would leave the 3- and 6-month annualized gains in that measure at 2.5% and 2.6%,\" much closer to the Fed's 2% target than October's 12-month gain is set to show.\n\"Those increases are close enough to the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation goal that most on the FOMC are likely content to stand pat on policy and let cooling labor market activity finish the job of getting inflation back to target,\" Feroli added. \"We continue to think the next move from the Fed is toward easier policy, but not until 3Q24.\"\nEarlier this month, stocks surged and bonds rallied \u2014 which sent yields lower \u2014 after October's Consumer Price Index showed inflation continued to slow last month.\nOn the corporate side, a smattering of quarterly results will provide investors with a further look at the health of the consumer, a look at the state of software demand, and whether AI is moving the needle for these businesses' customers.\nFoot Locker, Ulta Beauty, and Dollar Tree will be closely monitored for any forecasts regarding the holiday season and commentary on whether elevated interest rates and a softening labor market are pushing consumers to trade down.\nSalesforce's guidance for the current quarter will be scrutinized by the Street, with analysts at Goldman Sachs noting this period captures when customers decide on renewals and add-ons for next year's service.\nWall Street analysts expect the company's results to reveal how companies paying for cloud services or tools like Slack are responding to price increases. Updates on demand for Salesforce's AI products will also be in focus.\n\"Customers continue to optimize spend, reduce shelf ware, and prioritize software that delivers near-term value creation, resulting in a challenging demand environment for [Salesforce],\" Citi analyst Tyler Radke wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\nResults from Workday, Intuit, Snowflake, and Okta should hit on similar themes in the coming week.\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity (-16 expected, -19.2 previously); New home sales, October (723,000 annualized rate expected, 759,000 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, October (-4.8% expected, +12.3% previously)\nEarnings: Zscaler (ZS)\nEconomic data: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, November (101 expected, 102.6 previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, September (+0.9% expected, +1.01% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, September (+4.2% expected, +2.16% previously)\nEarnings: CrowdStrike (CRWD), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intuit (INTU), Workday (WDAY)\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Nov. 24 (+3.0% prior); Wholesale inventories month-over-month, October (+0.2% previously); Third quarter GDP, second estimate (+5.0% annualized rate expected, +4.9% previously); Third quarter personal consumption, second estimate (+2.4% annualized expected; +2.4% previously)\nEarnings: Dollar Tree (DLTR), Foot Locker (FL), Five Below (FIVE), Hormel Foods (HRL), La-Z-Boy (LZB), Okta (OKTA), Petco (WOOF), Snowflake (SNOW), Salesforce (CRM), Victoria's Secret (VSCO)\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ended Nov. 25 (218,000 expected, 209,000 previously); Continuing jobless claims, week ended Nov. 18 (1.87 million expected, 1.84 million previously); Personal income, month-over-month, October (+0.2% expected, +0.3% previously); Personal spending, month-over-month, October (+0.2% expected, +0.7% previously); PCE inflation, month-over-month, October (+0.1% expected,+ 0.4% previously); PCE inflation, year-over-year, October (+3.1% expected, +3.4% previously); \"Core\" PCE, month-over-month, October (+0.2% expected, +0.3% previously); \"Core\" PCE, year-over-year, October (+3.5% expected; +3.7% previously)\nEarnings: Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Big Lots (BIG), Build-A-Bear (BBW), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Dell (DELL), Kroger (KR), Marvell (MRVL), TD Bank (TD), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\nEconomic news: S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI, November final (49.4 previously); ISM manufacturing, November (47.7 expected, 46.7 previously)\nEarnings: Bank of Montreal (BMO)\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "text": "\nBy Siddharth Cavale\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retail chain Walmart on Monday said it is investing more than $9 billion over a two-year period to upgrade and modernize some U.S. stores with improved layouts, expanded product selections and new tech additions.\nOn Friday, 117 stores in 30 states will be re-launched showcasing the enhancements, representing investments of more than $500 million, Walmart said in a statement. In total, it plans to modernize more than 1,400 of its 4,717 Walmart stores across the country. The remodels do not apply to its warehouse club chain, Sam's Club, a spokesperson said.\n\"These construction investments allow us to create more local jobs and make it easier for our associates to get customers what they want, when they want it,\" John Furner, chief executive officer of Walmart's U.S. business said.\nWalmart's low-cost and low-margin groceries have been a big draw for Americans dealing with steep inflation in food prices, including eggs, protein and chocolate, over the past two years. In 2022, the company's sales surpassed $600 billion, a record.\nNow the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer wants to change its image from merely a steep discounter to a destination where customers can also purchase fashionable home goods and clothing.\nAs part of those efforts, the company tested some remodeled concept stores called \"Stores of the Future\" at a few Walmart Supercenters, including Teterboro in New Jersey, earlier this year. Executives have previously said the concept was a success, with same-store sales rising by a few percentage points and in Teterboro's case, as much as 20%.\nMonday's investments mark the national rollout of that concept, a Walmart spokesperson said.\nThe enhanced stores will have refreshed interiors and exteriors, with new paint, updated flooring, modernized restrooms, LED-lighting and new signage for brighter and easier navigation through the stores, the company said.\nCustomers also will see increased check-out options, including staffed lanes and self-checkout areas, and more grab-and-go food and beverage options in its grocery areas.\nStores will also host bigger pharmacies with private screening rooms for pharmacist consultations and services, and digital screens and QR codes that offer information on Walmart's services offered online, the company said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",

Tens of thousands of people gathered on Washington\u2019s National Mall to express support for Israel in one of the largest such demonstrations since the war began.\nFor more stories on the Israel-Hamas war, click here.\nAll time stamps are Israeli time:\nNetanyahu-Trudeau Trade Barbs Over Casualties (5:15 a.m.)\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back publicly at Justin Trudeau after the Canadian prime minister lamented \u201cthe human tragedy that is unfolding in Gaza is heart-wrenching, especially the suffering we see in and around the Al Shifa Hospital.\u201d\nNetanyahu, in a social media post, said Israel is doing all it can to protect civilians and that Hamas is responsible \u201cfor committing a double war crime \u2014 targeting civilians while hiding behind civilians.\u201d\nIsraeli Troops Reported in Hospital Basement (5:00 a.m.)\nA spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Al Jazeera that Israeli troops were searching through the basement of the Shifa hospital. Israel has said Hamas uses areas beneath hospital facilities, including basements and tunnels, to hide troops and store weapons.\nBiden-Netanyahu Discussed Hostage Situation (4:09 a.m.)\nBiden spoke with Netanyahu Tuesday afternoon about efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas, the White House said in a statement.\nIt wasn\u2019t clear if the two leaders spoke before the Israel Defense Forces operation at the Shifa hospital, or if Biden was informed of Israel\u2019s plans. White House officials said they had intelligence suggesting that some of those captured during the Oct. 7 raid on Israel had been held under the hospital complex.\nTroops Reported Inside Hospital Compound (3:45 a.m.)\nRegional news channels Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya said the Israeli military had entered the Shifa hospital compound, following the IDF statement that it would carry out an operation against Hamas at the facility.\nThe scale of the Israeli move wasn\u2019t immediately clear, but the decision is likely to fuel international criticism, even after Israel said Hamas used the hospital and other medical facilities to hide its forces. Hamas rejects the charge.\nHundreds of patients, medical personnel and displaced civilians were at the Shifa hospital in recent days, and supplies of medicine and fuel were believed to be running very low.\nIsraeli Forces Begin Operation at Key Gaza Hospital (2:10 a.m.)\nIsrael Defense Forces said they are \u201ccarrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital.\u201d In a statement, the IDF said that they had \u201cconveyed to the relevant authorities in Gaza once again that all military activities within the hospital must cease within 12 hours. Unfortunately, it did not.\u201d\nHamas has denied using the facility as a base of operations. A health ministry official at the hospital told Bloomberg that Israeli tanks were at the gates of the complex.\nPentagon Sends More Armaments to Israel (12:30 a.m.)\nThe Pentagon has quietly stepped up military aid to Israel, delivering on requests that include more laser-guided missiles for its Apache gunship fleet, as well as 155mm shells, night-vision devices, bunker-buster munitions and new army vehicles, according to an internal Defense Department list.\nThe weapons pipeline to Israel is extending beyond the well-publicized provision of Iron Dome interceptors and Boeing Co. smart bombs. It continues even as Biden administration officials increasingly caution the Israeli government to try to avoid civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.\nTens of Thousands Turn Out in Washington to Support Israel (10:20 p.m.)\nTens of thousands of people gathered on Washington\u2019s National Mall to express support for Israel in one of the largest such demonstrations since the war began.\nCongressional leaders addressed the crowd, denouncing what they said was rising antisemitism and pledging continued backing for Israel. Organizers said the event drew more than 200,000 people, but there was no official confirmation of that estimate.\nSecurity was tight at the event, but there were no immediate reports of violence. Thousands of supporters of Palestinians demonstrated in Washington on Nov. 5.\nUS Says Intelligence Confirms Hamas Hides Under Hospitals (9:40 p.m.)\nThe US has intelligence confirming Israel\u2019s assertion that Hamas and other Iran-backed militant groups are using hospitals \u2014 including the central Al-Shifa facility in Gaza \u2014 to conceal and support their operations, the White House said.\nThe groups \u201coperate a command and control node\u201d from Al-Shifa and have stored weapons and used tunnels underneath the hospital to hide their military operations, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One. The US also believes that the groups have held hostages under the hospital, he added, without specifying the source of the information.\nThe US said it believes militants were \u201cprepared to respond to a military operation\u201d by Israel against the facility. White House officials have said they don\u2019t want to see an aerial bombing of the facility or a firefight inside, because they don\u2019t want innocent patients to be hurt in the crossfire. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military\u2019s spokesman, called on Hamas operatives hiding under hospitals to surrender so as not to endanger patients.\nMore Signs of Hostage Deal With Hamas Cited by Broadcaster (9:27 p.m.)\nIsrael may be nearing a deal with Hamas for the return of some of the hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, Kan News says.\nNegotiators are currently discussing the names of Hamas members who would be released as part of the deal, the stages in which the agreement would be carried out and the number of days that Israel must agree to a cease-fire, the Israeli public broadcaster reported. Axios reporter Barak Ravid said that the head of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security services met with the Egyptian intelligence chief in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss efforts to free the hostages as well as Egypt\u2019s role during the war and afterward.\nIsrael Says It Seized Control of a Hamas Camp (6:59 p.m.)\nIsrael\u2019s military said it has gained control over the Shati Camp in northern Gaza. \u201cInside the camp are Hamas infrastructure and battalions, including the Shati Battalion, which took a central part in the invasion and massacre of Saturday, October 7th,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.\nCombined air and ground forces struck numerous targets on the outskirts of the Shati Camp over several days, including buildings and government institutions belonging to Hamas from which the IDF said \u201cterrorist activity was directed against the citizens of Israel and IDF forces.\u201d\nDuring the operation Hamas operatives were apprehended and transferred to Israel for interrogation, according to the Israeli statement.\nBiden Expresses Confidence Hostages Will Be Released (6:08 p.m.)\nPresident Joe Biden said he\u2019s optimistic the remaining hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 assault on Israel would be released. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking with the people involved every single day,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to happen. But I don\u2019t want to get into detail.\u201d\nThe Biden administration has been in touch with the Israeli government as well as leaders in Qatar, which houses Hamas\u2019s political office, about securing the release of the hostages.\nAsked to deliver a message of hope to the hostages, Biden said, \u201cHang in there, we\u2019re coming.\u201d\nWar Cabinet Minister Says Cease-Fire Wouldn\u2019t End War (5:16 p.m.)\nBenny Gantz, a member of Israel\u2019s war cabinet, said that \u201ceven if a cease-fire is required for the return of hostages from Gaza, there will be no stopping of the war.\u201d He said Israel is making every \u201cpolitical and military effort to bring the daughters and the sons home safely.\u201d\nGantz, a former defense minister, spoke during a visit to Israel\u2019s northern border, where there have been escalating exchanges between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, prompting the evacuation of 60,000 Israeli citizens. \u201cI see Nasrallah\u2019s conduct and ask: Has he lost touch with reality? This question should now be asked by Lebanese citizens and the Lebanese government,\u201d Gantz said, referring to Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.\nIsraeli Gas Flows to Egypt to Recover (4:39 p.m.)\nIsrael\u2019s natural gas flows to Egypt are expected to almost double and reach pre-war levels early next week, according to a person familiar with Egyptian imports, after a major offshore field resumed output on easing safety concerns.\nImports are expected to rise to 650 million cubic feet a day on Thursday, and to the normal level of 800 million early next week, from about 250 million earlier in November, the person said, asking not to be named because the information isn\u2019t public.\nHamas Media Office Says Gaza Deaths Top 11,500 (3:47 p.m.)\nThe Hamas-run media office said more than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the conflict. Medical workers at the Al-Shifa hospital have buried some of the dead in a mass grave on the facility\u2019s grounds, according to health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qedra.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nTexas Battles Wall Street in Threat to State\u2019s Muni Market\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\nWhy It\u2019s So Hard to Make Money in Space\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

The S&P 500 Index rose 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index narrowed earlier gains to end flat.\nU.S. retail sales fell in October, though by less than expected, giving some investors cause to celebrate that the U.S. economy is poised for a so-called \"soft landing\" and that the Federal Reserve is likely done raising rates.\nRecent U.S. data \"supports our view that consumer price inflation will continue to fall more rapidly than many expect, even as activity in the real economy holds up under the weight of higher rates,\" economists at Capital Economics said in a note.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.4% after data showed British inflation cooled more than forecast in October, hitting sterling and reinforcing bets the Bank of England will be cutting rates by the middle of 2024. [.EU]\n\"Good weather seems to be back. The market is starting to price in the possibility of rate cuts in the United States and also in Europe,\" said Carlo Franchini, head of institutional clients at Banca Ifigest in Milan.\n\"I think the equity rally will continue into 2024 and so will bonds of course, subject to the international picture that remains complicated with the war in Ukraine, the Middle East and trade tensions with China,\" he added.\nThe British consumer price index rose by 4.6% in the 12 months to October, slowing from September's 6.7% increase, the Office for National Statistics said. Inflation in Italy and France also receded to an annual growth rate of 1.8% and 4.5% respectively last month, according to their statistics agencies.\nOn Tuesday, data showed U.S. headline consumer prices were flat in October, against expectations for a 0.1% rise. Core CPI, at 0.2%, also came in below a forecast of 0.3%.\n\"I think the CPI number has just pushed the last person to cover their shorts,\" Naka Matsuzawa, Nomura's chief macro strategist, said on the phone from Tokyo.\nHe sees a \"more complicated\" process ahead, where stock market exuberance eventually collides with bond market expectations that an economic slowdown will drive rate cuts.\nDOLLAR SPUTTERS\nThe dollar sputtered after slumping on Tuesday following the softer U.S. inflation print. The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of peers, stood at 104.33, not far from Tuesday's two-month low of 103.98. [FRX/]\nInterest rate futures swung to price in an interest rate cut by the Fed as early as May, with a 30% chance it could come even sooner, in March.\nAfter dropping 19 basis points (bps) on Tuesday in their biggest one-day drop since March, 10-year Treasury yields bounced to 4.5333%. Ten-year German bond yields stood at 2.639%.\nSterling slid 0.72% to $1.24105 as the cooler inflation print helped the British currency reverse part of Tuesday's surge against a falling dollar. [GBP/] That helped London stocks outperform, up 0.62%. [.L] The euro inched around 0.25% lower at $1.08515.\nCHINA SUPPORT\nAdding to markets' cheer was strong industrial output and retail sales data in China and a report from Bloomberg News that China plans to provide 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) of low-cost financing to boost the housing market.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 2.85%, hitting its highest since mid-September. The Hang Seng rose nearly 4% in Hong Kong as mainland property developers rallied over 5%.\nChina's retail sales rose 7.6% in October, although that may have been flattered by the Golden Week holiday at the start of the month. Real estate remains in a deep funk, with investment in January-October down 9.3% year-on-year.\n\"It is clear that Beijing has been turning more proactive in recent weeks to help support the recovery,\" HSBC economists said in a note to clients. \"With ongoing uncertainties highlighted by the property sector, we think Beijing will continue to step up support through both fiscal and monetary means.\"\nThe weaker dollar and the expectation of more stimulus in top metals consumer China kept London copper prices, hovering near a five-week peak scaled in the previous session.

Both have denied the allegations.\nIn its previous earnings call, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said he expects Coinbase to prevail in the case.\nIn its shareholder letter, Coinbase said it generated approximately $105 million of total transaction revenue in October as the price of bitcoin - the world's largest cryptocurrency - enjoyed a bounce, but the company urged caution in extrapolating those results.\n(Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Marguerita Choy)",

Prior to the Sunday night meeting, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant\u2019s office released photographs of him surrounded by officials involved in the negotiations, including the head of the Mossad intelligence agency, the news website said. An Israeli official said that a deal isn\u2019t expected today, Ynet reported.\nHamas Chief Returns to Hostage Talks, Axios Reports (9:42 p.m.)\nHamas\u2019s leader, Yahya Sinwar, has re-engaged in talks on a hostage release, Axios reported. He\u2019s agreed in principle to increase the number of women and children to be freed to more than 50, Axios said, citing three unnamed sources.

Hagari also presented camera footage that showed that two non-Israeli hostages, a Nepali and a Thai, were taken to Shifa Hospital by gunmen on Oct. 7. An additional photograph showed that an Israeli military vehicle that was stolen during the attack was taken to Shifa Hospital.\n\u201cThese findings add to previous evidence presented regarding Hamas\u2019 use of the hospital area as infrastructure for its terrorist activities in a systematic and ongoing manner,\u201d the IDF said.\nPalestinian Death Toll Rises Above 13,000, Hamas Says (8:30 p.m.)\nThe Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 13,000, the Hamas-run government media office said.\nMore than 5,500 children are among the dead and more than 6,000 people are reported missing or trapped under rubble.

It is registered in the UK.\nIsraeli Army Says It Uncovered Fortified Tunnel Under Al-Shifa Hospital (7 p.m.)\nIsrael said it has exposed a 10-meter deep, 55-meter-long fortified tunnel underneath the Shifa hospital complex.\nThe Israel Defense Forces released a video showing a deep staircase leading to the entrance to the tunnel shaft. The tunnel leads to a blast-proof door with a firing hole. This type of door is used by Hamas to block Israeli forces from entering the command centers and the underground assets belonging to Hamas, the military said. Forces are continuing to uncover the route of the tunnel, it said.\nThe tunnel shaft was uncovered in the area of the hospital under a shed alongside a vehicle containing numerous weapons including RPGs, explosives and Kalashnikov rifles, the IDF said.\nHostage Deal is Closer, Biden Aide Says (4 p.m.)\nAn agreement for Hamas to release hostages taken during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel may be the closest yet and would require a multiday pause in the fighting in Gaza, US Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer said.\nRead more: Deal to Free Hamas Hostages Has Gotten Closer, Biden Aide Says\nUNRWA Estimates Gaza Needs 160,000 Liters of Fuel Daily (2 p.m.)\nGaza needs 160,000 liters (42,000 gallons) of fuel daily to maintain \u201ca reasonable level of humanitarian services,\u201d said Adnan Abu Hassna, United Nations Relief and Works Agency spokesman.\nThe fuel is needed for water desalination, sewage treatment plants, wells and hospitals, as well as hundreds of vehicles for UNRWA\u2019s operations.

        "text": "\nA look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.\nAsia started Monday in hesitant fashion and has turned steadily grimmer, although there is no obvious catalyst for the risk-off mood. Most regional share markets are modestly lower, as are Wall Street and European futures.\nTreasury yields are a few basis points higher, but that hasn't helped the dollar which lost ground to a broadly firmer yen. Oil prices have slipped further, while gold hit a six-month high above $2,017 an ounce - although no fundamental factors were evident behind the move.\nChina's central bank announced it would encourage financial institutions to support private companies, including with a greater tolerance for non-performing loans. The market didn't seem impressed and China's blue chips are down around 1.2%.\nThere has been a build-up of reports about official steps to support the property sector, including white-listing companies for loans, yet it's still mostly talk rather than action.\nThe official China PMI for November is due on Thursday and analysts generally look for a small pick-up and maybe a reading above 50.0.\nThe approach of the month's end could also generate some caution given the hefty gains investors are sitting on. Japan's Nikkei is up more than 8% so far in November, as is the S&P 500 - and that would be its best performance since mid-2022.\nAbout 55% of the S&P 500's component shares are trading above their 200-day moving averages, the highest share in nearly two months, according to LPL Financial.\nThe oil market faces a tense few days ahead of a meeting of OPEC+ on Nov. 30, which was postponed from Sunday as producers struggled to forge a unanimous position.\nOPEC+ sources have said that African oil producers are seeking higher caps for 2024, while media reports suggest that Saudi Arabia may extend its additional 1 million bpd voluntary production cut which is due to expire at the end of December.\nBrent was down another 0.8% today, and 8.6% for the month so far, which if sustained would be a boon both for the battle against inflation and for consumer spending power.\nThe Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation - personal consumption expenditures - is due on Thursday and forecast to dip back to 3.1%, in part due to falling gas prices. The core is seen easing to 3.5%, its lowest since mid-2021.\nData on EU inflation is also due Thursday, along with measures for Germany and Spain. Core EU inflation is forecast at 3.9%, the lowest since the middle of last year.\nIf realised, this will support market wagers of no more rate hikes, and policy easing in 2024. Futures imply around 80 basis points of cuts for both the Fed and the ECB, starting in June.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will have a chance to push back against the doves at a Fireside Chat on Friday, and there are at least seven other Fed speakers on the docket this week.\nEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has also sounded in no hurry to ease and will have another opportunity to drive home the message at the EU parliament later on Monday.\nKey developments that could influence markets on Monday:\n- ECB President Christine Lagarde at ECON Hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament\n- UK CBI distributive trades for Nov\n- U.S. new home sales, building permits for Oct\n(By Wayne Cole; Editing by Edmund Klamann)",

Employees should also avoid wearing luxury brands or revealing their compensation to third parties, the memo said.\nThe directive underscores the increasing level of self-scrutiny at Chinese financial institutions after authorities lashed out this year at bankers\u2019 \u201chedonistic\u201d lifestyles, and ordered them to comply with President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d drive. It also highlights concern among international investors that China is increasingly restricting access to transparent data and research in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nWhile Xi has vowed to make the country a more attractive place for foreign capital, his government has also been curbing the availability of some economic statistics and cracking down on consultants that help global fund managers make investment decisions in China. Among recent examples of pushback against negative commentary, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts attracted a wave of criticism in July after publishing a bearish report on Chinese banks.\nCICC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nExtra Caution\nCICC told its analysts to take extra caution when sharing views with clients outside China to reduce national security and political risks, according to the memo. They were also asked to conduct due diligence on experts they intend to invite to deal pitches and conferences, it added.\nThe Beijing-based firm is not alone in disciplining its employees as China stepped up its scrutiny over the conduct of analysts since mid-2020.\nAt least two other major investment banks have given verbal guidance to analysts over the past year barring them from making negative comments on the domestic economy or bragging about their pay, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. A Shenzhen-based brokerage discouraged its economists from discussing topics including deflation and the yuan exchange rate, one of the people said.\nThe environment has made it difficult for financial conference organizers to line up speakers who are willing to share candid views about Chinese economy and markets at financial conferences, said the people.\nChallenges Ahead\nCICC\u2019s latest document covers conduct guidelines that span from client engagement and social media use to expense reimbursement, with some parts extending to employees\u2019 family members.\nThe company has already resorted to cost cuts amid slumping profits and a leadership reshuffle. Business-related expenses will be strictly controlled, with analysts discouraged from taking taxis home after roadshows or ordering drinks at business banquets, according to the document. CICC earlier this year slashed some senior bankers\u2019 compensation for 2022 by more than 40% and scaled back travel perks.\nBankers may have to brace for more challenges ahead. China\u2019s parliament said earlier this month the financial industry\u2019s profits still have room to fall as a share of the economy, as regulators nudge banks to extend more support to the embattled property sector. On Wednesday, 19 Chinese brokerages including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley\u2019s local ventures vowed to fight corruption in their investment-bank businesses.\nXi\u2019s signature anti-graft campaign has brought down more than 100 senior financial executives and officials this year alone. And while China is striving to restore investor confidence in its feeble economy and markets, it\u2019s likely to continue with its historic crack down on information deemed harmful.\nAccording to the memo, CICC analysts should be discreet in commenting on social media, and avoid posting or sharing politically sensitive content. They\u2019re also mandated to \u201cactively\u201d participate in party-building activities, which typically involve studying the musings of the top leaders.\nHere are some other restrictions that CICC is imposing on its analysts:\nAvoid making comments that are inconsistent with government policies\nAvoid sharing unpublished views, full reports on social media WeChat, and try to keep all posts work-related\nMake sure family members abide by basic moral standards\nAvoid using full per diem allowance on meals when working overtime\n--With assistance from John Cheng, Jackie Cai, Heng Xie and Denise Wee.\n(Adds other banks\u2019 restrictions from the seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

        "text": "\n(Updates at 0925GMT)\nBy Samuel Indyk and Ankur Banerjee\nLONDON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - European shares were holding near a 5-1/2 week high on Tuesday while the dollar languished near its lowest in two-and-a-half months on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely done with interest rate hikes.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index was little changed on the day at 455.98 points. The index is up over 5% this month and on track for its biggest monthly gain since January.\nGermany's DAX was eking out a 0.15% gain, while France's CAC 40 and Britain's FTSE 100 were a touch softer.\nWith the economic calendar bare in Europe, Wall Street futures were trading lower before the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting, which investors will use to gauge which way rates are headed, and also on earnings from Nvidia, which hit a record high on Monday.\nOn Monday, Wall Street's three major stock averages rose, with Nasdaq's 1% rally leading the charge as heavyweight Microsoft hit a record high after it hired Sam Altman, who headed OpenAI until he was ousted late last week.\nStock markets have broadly rebounded in November as a flurry of data that showed U.S. inflation might be easing has spurred bets that the Fed is done with monetary tightening and rate cuts may be on the way next year.\nTraders have nearly fully priced in the likelihood that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in December, and some have started pricing in rate cuts as soon as March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\"The rapid drop in inflation, both in the U.S. and Europe, has been incredibly positive and quite substantial,\" said Hani Redha, portfolio manager, global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments.\n\"Inflation relief and then loosening of financial conditions has provided relief for risk assets.\"\nTrading is expected to be muted for much of the week, ahead of Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and a sparse data calendar for the week.\nIn Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.6% higher having earlier touched 511.05, the highest since Sept. 5. Japan's Nikkei closed lower but remained close to the 33-year high it touched on Monday. The index is up roughly 28% this year, making it the best performing stock market in Asia.\nThe MSCI World Equity Index gained 0.1%.\nTreasury yields were lower in the wake of solid bidding in the $16-billion sale of 20-year Treasury bonds on Monday that suggested the market still anticipates inflation will decelerate and the Fed will cut rates next year.\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 1 basis point to 4.41%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was down 3 basis points to 4.547%.\nLower yields kept the dollar on the back foot, with the dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major currencies, down 0.1% at 103.30, having touched near three-month low of 103.17 earlier in the session.\nThe Japanese yen strengthened to 147.155 per dollar, lifting further away from the one-year low of 151.92 it touched last week.\nChina's yuan rose to its highest since July in both the offshore and onshore markets, gaining from a much stronger midpoint fixing.\n\"A softer dollar environment has seen Chinese authorities turn the screws on those with short renminbi positions,\" ING strategist Chris Turner said.\n\"For the short term, we think these moves can lift the Asian FX bloc in general and add to the current soft dollar environment.\"\nThe Australian dollar, often seen as a barometer of risk appetite, touched a more than three-month high of $0.6587 earlier in the session.\nThe head of Australia's central bank said on Tuesday inflation will remain a crucial challenge over the next one to two years, in comments made two weeks after policymakers raised interest rates to a 12-year high earlier to tame high prices.\nOil prices eased, reversing the previous day's rally. U.S. crude eased 1% to $77.03 per barrel and Brent was at $81.54, down a similar amount.\nSpot gold rose to $1977.60 per ounce, its highest level in more than two weeks, aided by the weaker dollar.\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Bernadette Baum)",

The net result is that the yen was little changed on the day, leaving it down some 13% this year, the worst performance of any Group-of-10 currency.\n\u201cI suspect it is the market doing it to itself, with the fear of BOJ intervention,\u201d according to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global. Approximately $1.25 billion in yen options expire Monday at the 152 per dollar level, likely contributing to any sudden movements in the currency around the key level, he said.\nChandler likened it to an episode in early October, when the currency saw a similarly sudden bout of strength in New York trading, triggering a debate over whether Japan had intervened.\nThe currency traded around the 151.70 level early Tuesday in Asia.\nThe yen has been mired in a trend of sustained depreciation, driven by a persistently wide interest-rate gap between Japan and the US. The Bank of Japan further loosened its grip on government bond yields on Oct. 31, but stuck with its negative interest-rate policy, a decision that underwhelmed traders looking for a trigger to drive a sustained yen rebound.\nThe Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is saying it may lift rates again after hiking them to the highest in more than two decades, a dynamic that has fueled broad dollar strength this year.\nThe yen\u2019s decline this year has fed into an inflation rate that has been above the BOJ\u2019s 2% target since April 2022, putting pressure on it to normalize monetary policy.\nLow volatility in foreign-exchange rates has also encouraged so-called carry trades, a strategy that involves raising money in yen and selling it for higher-yielding currencies, another factor that\u2019s weighed on the Japanese currency.\nBrief Rally\nThe sharp, brief rally in the yen began around 10 a.m. New York time.\nJapan\u2019s finance minister, Shunichi Suzuki, said Monday that policymakers would respond as needed to sudden moves in the yen. The nation\u2019s top currency official, Masato Kanda, said on Nov. 1 that authorities were \u201con standby,\u201d when asked if he was prepared to intervene in the currency market or take other measures to curb the yen\u2019s slide.\n\u201cIn our view, this is again just reflective of a market that is cautious about potential BOJ intervention as opposed to actual involvement,\u201d said Simon Harvey, head of foreign-exchange analysis at Monex Europe.\n\u201cWe saw similar sharp retracements last month around the 150 handle, with the BoJ official intervention data showing no ultimate involvement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe move today looks similar in terms of volume and range to these instances in early October.\u201d\n--With assistance from George Lei, Robert Fullem and Lisa Wolfson.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

        "text": "\nBy David Lawder\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Trade ministers from members of an Asian free trade pact abandoned by the United States affirmed on Wednesday a desire for more countries to join the bloc if they can meet its standards.\nThe officials from the 12 Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) countries met in San Francisco just after trade negotiations for the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) initiative ground to a halt without an agreement this week.\nThe lack of an IPEF trade deal is a setback for the Biden administration. It had aimed to showcase the initiative during this week's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco as a symbol of its economic re-engagement in Asia, providing countries a counterweight to China's growing clout in the region.\nThe CPTPP is the successor to the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal, from which former President Donald Trump withdrew as soon as he took office in 2017.\nThe CPTPP meeting on the sidelines of the APEC leaders' summit was the first ministerial to include new member Britain, which signed up to the trade bloc in July.\nIn a joint statement posted on the UK trade ministry website, the ministers \"reaffirmed that the CPTPP is open to accession requests by economies that are ready to meet the high standards of the agreement and have a demonstrated pattern of complying with trade commitments.\"\nThe statement made no mention of China's application to join the bloc, nor applications by Taiwan, Costa Rica and Ecuador.\nIt said accession decisions are dependent upon consensus, and since July, they have been \"gathering information on whether aspirant economies can meet CPTPP\u2019s high standards.\"\nInformation collected to date \"will not prejudge any process, outcome, decision and/or actions to be taken by CPTPP members,\" it said, adding that the bloc would apply lessons learned in the UK accession.\nThe current CPTPP members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Most overlap with both APEC and the IPEF initiative.\n(Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

In May, it paused mining at Balama after oversupply hit prices.\nThe export controls could mean that automakers and suppliers of battery materials will have to accelerate their search for alterative sources of the mineral.\nSyrah said that, based on feedback from its customers and analysts, buyers are looking to stockpile graphite to reduce the risk of near-term supply disruptions ahead of the ban, and ahead of China's winter when it tends to produce less natural graphite.\n\"Any disruption or reduction in China anode precursor or AAM export supply without replacement supply would impact battery production outside China,\" it said.\nUncertainties regarding the impact of the controls on Chinese supply is expected to continue into 2024, Syrah added, but for now, it does not expect any near-term \"meaningful\" impact demand from China on its Mozambique project.\n\"Although the impacts of implementation are not yet known, the announced graphite export controls in China are increasing Government and private sector attention on the strategic importance of Syrah as a unique ex-China natural graphite and AAM supplier in the battery supply chain,\" the company said in a statement.\nSyrah's comments come as Australian government officials visit the United States to shore up cooperation over critical minerals.\nShares in Syrah spiked to 43% to A$0.95 a share on Friday when the export bans were announced before trading at $0.66 cents on Thursday.\nThe U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) last month approved a loan of up to $150 million for Syrah's Mozambique operations.\n(Reporting by Roushni Nair in Bengaluru and Melanie Burton in Melbourne, editing by Miral Fahmy)",

        "text": "\nNov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose moderately in October, while the annual increase in inflation was the smallest since early 2021, signs of cooling demand that could further strengthen expectations that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking campaign was over.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.7% gain in September, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast spending gaining 0.2%.\nThe moderation in consumer spending followed a brisk growth pace in the third quarter and reflects the impact of higher borrowing costs and depleted excess savings among low-income households. Though wages remain elevated, the pace of increase has slowed from earlier in the year as the labor market eases.\nMillions of Americans resumed student loan repayments last month, which could crimp spending next year.\nFears that the economy could slide into recession in early 2024 could see households reluctant to spend and instead build their savings. So far, the economy has defied predictions of a recession, growing at a robust 5.2% annualized pace in the third quarter, the fastest in nearly two years.\nGrowth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 2% rate. Most economists expect the economy to settle into a period of very slow growth, and avoid an outright recession.\nInflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was unchanged in October after climbing 0.4% in September.\nIn the 12 months through October, the PCE price index increased 3.0%. That was the smallest year-on-year gain since March 2021 and followed a 3.4% advance in September.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index gained 0.2% last month, after rising 0.3% in September. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% on a sustainable basis are needed to bring inflation back to the U.S. central bank's 2% target, according to economists.\nThe so-called core PCE price index advanced 3.5% on a year-on-year basis in October, after increasing 3.7% in September.\nThe Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for monetary policy.\nSubsiding demand and inflation pressures have raised optimism that the Fed is probably done raising interest rates this cycle, with financial markets even anticipating a rate cut in mid-2024. Since March 2022, the central bank has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range.\nEasing labor market conditions were reinforced by a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended Nov. 25. Economists had forecast 226,000 claims for the latest week.\nLast week's claims data included the Thanksgiving Holiday. Claims tend to be volatile around holidays. Still, the labor market is cooling in tandem with overall demand in the economy.\nThe number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 86,000 to 1.927 million during the week ending Nov. 18, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims resumed their upward trend, which started since mid-September, after a brief interruption in the prior week.\nA combination of loosening labor market conditions and difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations following an unprecedented surge in applications for jobless benefits early in the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed continuing claims higher.

        "text": "\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The United Kingdom is hosting the AI Safety Summit, bringing politicians, computer scientists and tech executives to a site chosen for its symbolism: Bletchley Park, synonymous with codebreaking and the birth of computing.\nDuring World War II, a group of mathematicians, cryptographers, crossword puzzlers, chess masters and other experts gathered at the Victorian country house 45 miles (72 kilometers) northwest of London to wage a secret war against Nazi Germany. Their goal: cracking Adolf Hitler\u2019s supposedly unbreakable codes.\nBletchley Park\u2019s most famous feat was outwitting Germany\u2019s Enigma encryption machine, which produced a constantly changing cipher and was widely considered unbreakable. To crack it, mathematician Alan Turing \u2014 building on work done by Polish codebreakers \u2014 developed the \u201cTuring bombe,\u201d a forerunner of modern computers.\nDeciphered Enigma messages revealed details of the movements of Germany\u2019s U-boat fleets and provided crucial information for the North African desert campaign and the Allied invasion of France. Some historians say cracking the code helped shorten the war by up to two years.\nHistorian Chris Smith, author of \u201cThe Hidden History of Bletchley Park,\u201d said it is impossible to prove the extent to which the work at Bletchley Park shortened the war, but it undoubtedly sped up the development of computing.\nBletchley Park's wartime scientists developed Colossus, the first programmable digital computer, to crack the Lorenz cipher that Hitler used to communicate with his generals.\n\u201cThey built, effectively, one of the early generations of computers from basically nothing,\u201d Smith said, exhibiting a \u201ctechnological optimism\u201d that's a striking feature of wartime Bletchley Park.\nNo wonder current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s government finds it inspiring.\nSmith, a lecturer in history at Coventry University, said a mythology has developed around Bletchley Park, as a playground for Turing and other eccentric scientists, that oversimplifies its true contribution.\n\u201cIt fits into this idea that a group of boffins with a bit of wool and some yards of wire and some bits and bobs can win the war,\u201d he said.\nIn fact, almost 10,000 people worked at Bletchley Park during the war, three-quarters of them women, overflowing from the mansion into newly built brick and concrete blocks and smaller wooden structures known as huts.\n\u201cThe way to imagine Bletchley Park is a massive civil service bureaucracy,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a factory. \u2026 Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. It\u2019s always going.\u201d\nWhen peace came, the codebreakers returned to civilian life, sworn to secrecy about their wartime work. It was not until the 1970s that the work at Bletchley Park became widely known in Britain.\nThe site opened as a museum in 1994, after local historians banded together to prevent it from being bulldozed to build a supermarket. It was restored to its 1940s appearance, complete with manual typewriters, rotary phones and enamel mugs \u2014 including one chained to a radiator in Hut 8, where Turing led the Enigma team.\nAfter the war, Turing continued to work on computing and developed the \u201cTuring test\u201d to measure when artificial intelligence becomes indistinguishable from a human \u2014 a test some say modern-day AI has already passed.\nIn 1952 he was convicted of \u201cgross indecency\u201d over his relationship with another man, stripped of his security clearance and forced to take estrogen to neutralize his sex drive. He died at 41 in 1954 after eating an apple laced with cyanide.\nTuring received a posthumous apology from the British government in 2009 and a royal pardon in 2013. The 2014 film \u201cThe Imitation Game,\u201d starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, cemented his national hero status.\nTuring is commemorated by statues and plaques across the U.K. One of the most prestigious honors in computing, the $1 million Turing Prize, is named after him. His face even adorns the Bank of England\u2019s 50-pound note.",

Markets climbed in recent days on hints from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that policymakers may be done raising interest rates and on signs of a slowing economy.\nSummers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV, also renewed his criticism of US debt issuance management in recent years \u2014 a topic newly in focus thanks to criticism of the Treasury from billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller.\nRelated: Druckenmiller Digs In on Criticism of Yellen, Disputes Her Math\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our debts have been well managed over the last few years,\u201d Summers said, pointing especially to the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing program. Through QE, the Fed created bank reserves to purchase what were at the time low-yielding, longer dated Treasuries. Today, the Fed now pays much higher interest on those reserves than the income it receives from its bond portfolio.\nFor federal authorities, they effectively swapped longer-term debt for shorter-term obligations. Summers said if a household that shifted into a floating-rate mortgage in 2021 when rates were low \u201cwould be regretting its decisions today.\u201d\nA knock-on effect from the Fed\u2019s policy is that it now no longer transfers about $100 billion a year in income to the Treasury \u2014 a shift that has worsened the fiscal deficit.\n\u201cWe probably need to rethink a lot of our thinking on debt management,\u201d Summers said.\nStocks and bonds added to their gains Friday in the wake of an October jobs report that showed weaker payroll gains than anticipated, along with a step down in wage increases and a tick up in the unemployment rate. Summers said the data weren\u2019t conclusive, however.\nRead More: US Jobs Data Show Broad Cooling After Run of Surprise Strength\n\u201cThe labor market\u2019s not quite red hot the way that it was a few months ago,\u201d said Summers. \u201cBut whether it\u2019s in a place that\u2019s consistent with sustainable inflation at 2% I think that\u2019s still very much in doubt.\u201d\nSummers also criticized Fed policymakers for specifying that the run-up in longer-term Treasury yields seen before this week effectively lessened the argument for them to raise rates again. Powell said last month that the rise in yields \u201cat the margin\u201d could lessen the need for more Fed action.\n\u201cI am not confident of a central element in the Fed\u2019s thinking,\u201d Summers said. \u201cWhich is, they can regard higher long term rates as some kind of contractionary impulse to which the right response is for their policy to be easy.\u201d\nIf yields are higher thanks to government borrowing or stronger investment, \u201cthat is not the basis\u201d for an easier stance, he said. If they\u2019re higher because of the term premium \u2014 where investors demand extra to buy longer-term securities instead of just rolling over shorter-dated ones \u2014 it\u2019s not clear how big the impact of that phenomenon is on investment decisions, Summers said.\nThe former Treasury chief also blasted House Republican policymakers for funding a package of aid to Israel by reducing the budget of the IRS. That \u201cfoolish\u201d approach would simply raise the deficit as less revenue is collected, he said. The White House threatened to veto the bill, which is also opposed in the Senate.\nRead More: House Passes Israel Aid Tied to IRS Cuts, Triggering Biden Clash\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World\nOnline Gambling Has Millions of Young Africans Battling Addiction\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nShipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Mondino, Milei\u2019s incoming foreign minister, met in Brasilia with Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira, to whom she handed the invitation for Lula.\n\u201cThe main message is that we are brotherly countries, and we will continue to be so,\u201d Mondino told reporters after the meeting. \u201cWe have to work hard together to make both countries grow.\u201d\nRead More: Caputo Tells Bankers Argentina Dollarization Is Medium-Term Goal\nMilei is softening his aggressive rhetoric toward trading partners such as China and Brazil after calling Lula a \u201ccommunist with whom he wouldn\u2019t deal\u201d in an interview with Bloomberg News. After winning election, Milei told local TV that Lula would \u201cbe welcome\u201d to attend the inauguration.

The partnership will continue better and as quickly as we can.\u201d\nLula put relations with Argentina on hold to understand the incoming Milei administration\u2019s plans for its relationship with what is its largest trading partner in South America.\nMondino, speaking alongside Vieira, said that trade agreements should be signed between the Mercosur bloc and the European Union \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and, eventually, with other countries such as Singapore.\nThe two did not discuss the BRICS grouping, Mondino said in response to a reporter\u2019s question, adding that she doesn\u2019t know what advantages the bloc could offer Argentina. \u201cWe already work with practically all the countries\u201d in the group, Mondino said.\nMilei will be joined on the US trip by sister Karina Milei, potential cabinet chief Nicolas Posse and adviser Santiago Caputo.\n(Updates with trip details in second paragraph, names of delegation members in final paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nScientists and Farmers Race to Save the World\u2019s Banana Supply\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nBy Lawrence White and Selena Li\nLONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) -StanChart shares fell 12% in London on Thursday before trading was briefly halted, after it announced its profit unexpectedly plunged by a third due to a nearly $1 billion combined hit from its exposure to China's real estate and banking sectors.\nThe bank said pre-tax profit dropped 33% in the third quarter, far worse than analyst estimates, as it booked a $700 million impairment from its stake in China Bohai Bank, and a $186 million charge from Chinese commercial real estate.\nBy 0919 GMT, Standard Chartered shares were down 10.5%, set for their largest one-day fall since March last year, when Russia invaded Ukraine.\nThe U.K.-headquartered bank, which earns most of its revenue in Asia, booked July-September statutory pretax profit of $633 million. That compared with $996 million a year earlier and the $1.41 billion average of analyst estimates.\nThe hefty loss in China, where StanChart has based much of its expansion effort, underlines the challenge it faces to improve returns via exposure to the world's second-largest economy at a time of slowing growth and widening losses on loans.\nStanChart said the hit on its 16% stake in China Bohai, a lender in the eastern coastal city of Tianjin in which it invested more than a decade ago, was due to lower forecast interest rates and decreased lending margins.\nBohai booked a 17.8% fall in January-June net interest income, leading to a nearly 7% decline in its overall profit, according to company filings.\n\"We took a couple of impairment charges a year and a bit ago, and we have taken the extra impairment charge as you can see today,\" Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told reporters.\n\"That is reflective of the fact that particularly its own net interest margin has been weaker,\" he said.\nA raft of government easing measures has done little to allay China's economic fragility as a crisis in its property market deepens with high-profile debt-repayment defaults.\nStanChart's Chinese real estate exposure totalled $2.7 billion as of the end of September, down $200 million from the previous quarter.\nShares in rival HSBC, which similarly has exposure to Chinese real estate and to the bank sector via its stake in Bank of Communications, were down only 2% on Thursday as investors saw limited read-across between the two.\nStanChart, which has been the subject of repeated takeover speculation in the last decade, saw renewed interest earlier this year after First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) in January said it had considered but abandoned a bid.\nStanChart has recently had \"no contact\" with FAB, Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told reporters on a conference call on Thursday.\n'SOLID PERFORMANCE' IN OTHER BUSINESS\nStanChart said it is confident of hitting its return-on-tangible-equity targets of 10% this year and 11% in 2024, but downgraded some other performance forecasts for the year.\n\"Investors were expecting a clean set of third quarter numbers, and we do not have that today,\" said Jefferies analyst Joe Dickerson.\nThe \"silver lining\" for investors was the bank's underlying business performance - excluding impairment charges - remained solid, Dickerson said in a note to clients.\nNet interest margin, a measure of return on lending, will now \"approach\" 1.7 percentage points rather than be \"around\" that level, StanChart said.\nRate-sensitive businesses received a boost, with income from transaction banking - the bulk in cash management services - increasing 42% and retail products reporting 17% growth.\nIn the financial markets trading division, income fell 8% as reduced market volatility curbed client appetite for trading.\n(Reporting by Selena Li and Lawrence White; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Christina Fincher)",

Since the last refunding announcement in August, borrowing rates have spiralled to their highest since 2006-07.\nThe dollar index was last down 0.14% at 106.45, hurt by a small pick up in the euro, which gained 0.17% to $1.05835.\nThe common currency has had a quiet October, and still is not far off a 10-month low of $1.0448 hit at the start of the month.\nIn the mix in Europe on Monday was cooling German state inflation data, which pointed to slowing headline inflation in the euro zone's largest economy, and a separate release showing German gross domestic product fell by 0.1% quarter on quarter, though this was above expectations.\nCENTRAL BANKS\nOf the three central bank meetings, the BOJ's is attracting the most scrutiny from investors given heightened speculation over a policy tweak.\nA recent surge in global interest rates has heightened pressure on the BOJ to change its bond yield control policy, as speculation mounts that the central bank could hike its existing yield cap at this week's meeting.\nThe Fed and BoE are both expected to keep rates steady so, barring any surprises, the focus will be more around the message the policymakers communicate.\nThe yen was little changed at 149.75 per dollar, getting a slight reprieve after having struck a one-year trough of 150.78 per dollar last week.\nThe pound was steady at $1.2125.\nU.S. nonfarm payrolls data on Friday will also be important for expectations of the Fed's rate hike path.\n\"October\u2019s jobs report takes on added importance on the back of September\u2019s dramatic outcome, when net of revisions the cumulative payroll gain was 455k. The report will help to determine whether September was more signal or noise,\" said BNP Paribas analysts in a note.\n\"We expect a 190k payroll print - still sturdy but not compellingly pointing to reacceleration. However, another firm print would likely see long-end yields increase further as the market reassess the degree of policy-rate restriction and inflation expectations rise,\" the note added.\n(Reporting by Rae Wee in Singapore and Alun John in London; Editing by Miral Fahmy and Mark Potter)",

The mine, owned by China's MMG Ltd, began operations in 2016 and is among the largest copper producers in Peru, the world's No. 2 producer of the metal.\nThe union had already kicked off a strike on Sunday, which is set to end Tuesday, over the profit sharing.\nThe miner, as part of its contract with workers, is to share some profits every year with employees.\nHowever, the mine \"had already said that there wouldn't be any profit sharing this year,\" Ramos said. \"So they're going to have to see how to pay the workers. By contract they were supposed to have given us part of that payment in November.\"\nLas Bambas has pumped out around 221,160 metric tons of copper from January to September this year, a 21.7% boost from the year before, according to sources at the mining ministry.\nThe mine's production has steadily increased after having to freeze operations at the beginning of the year due to roadblocks by anti-government protesters following December's ouster of President Pedro Castillo.\nA source close to the mine said the company respects labor rights \"and works hard to ensure a safe working environment for its workers,\" noting the labor ministry had declared the current strike \"inadmissible\".\nThe union, which represents more than 1,000 workers, is currently registering the strike set for Nov. 28 with the labor ministry, Ramos said.\n(Reporting by Marco Aquino, Writing by Isabel Woodford and Kylie Madry, Editing by Louise Heavens, Kirsten Donovan and David Gregorio)",

The top-spending hour is usually from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m., according to the company\u2019s analysts.\nMonday\u2019s spending will cap off a record five days of online purchasing: Black Friday topped projections at $9.8 billion, up 7.5% from a year earlier. Thanksgiving spending of $5.6 billion was up 5.5%, according to figures released early Monday from Adobe. Adobe expects total spending for the Thursday-Monday period, which they call Cyber Week, to be as much as $38.1 billion, an increase from its earlier forecast of $37.2 billion.\nFlexible spending options, including buy-now-pay-later features online, have helped shoppers stretch budgets otherwise battered by inflation. Consumers used such promotions to spend $7.3 billion from Nov. 1 to Nov. 26, up 14% from a year ago, according to Adobe, underscoring how credit is helping retailers spur spending.\nThe adjusted Cyber Monday forecast follows a robust Thanksgiving weekend for US retailers, which generate much of their sales and profits during the annual shopathon. US shoppers spent $10.3 billion online Saturday and Sunday, an increase of 7.7% from a year earlier. Analysts are closely watching holiday shopping this year to assess the American consumer\u2019s staying power as pandemic-era savings dwindle and interest rates remain at a 20-plus-year high.\n\u201cAn uncertain demand environment pushed retailers to deliver big discounts this season, while also fortifying their e-commerce services with flexible payment methods,\u201d said Vivek Pandya, a lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. \u201cConsumers have taken note and spent at record rates during the big shopping days, despite dealing with rising costs in other parts of their lives.\u201d\nThe S&P 500\u2019s Retailing Index rose less than 1% on Monday. Shopify Inc. shares surged as much as 5.2% after the Ottawa-based e-commerce company said merchants set a Black Friday record with a combined $4.1 billion in sales.\nAverage transaction sizes for most large retailers, including Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., were down slightly in the first eight hours of Cyber Monday compared with a year earlier, according to data compiled by researcher Attain. The exceptions were Best Buy, Temu and eBay, which all saw average transaction sizes increase in early shopping.\nThe data show shoppers are resilient and curious about shopping on new platforms such as Temu and Shein, said Brian Mandelbaum, chief executive officer of Chicago-based Attain, which gleans insights from credit-card transactions. \u201cThese emerging platforms like Temu are attracting new consumers and have an opportunity to chip away at market share from established giants like Amazon,\u201d he said.\nBig sale days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday have been gradually losing their cachet as shoppers spread their spending over longer periods. Still, with inflation-stung consumers watching their budgets, retailers increasingly count on these events to see what products shoppers are clicking on \u2014 then targeting them with bigger discounts as the clock counts down to Christmas.\nMost retailers recycled their same Black Friday discounts on Cyber Monday, meaning shoppers who waited aren\u2019t getting a better deal than if they\u2019d made the purchase a few days ago, said Kristin McGrath, an editor at RetailMeNot, which monitors deals.\n\u201cA lot of people ask if they should wait for Cyber Monday, but this year we\u2019re just seeing a lot of the same Black Friday deals across the board,\u201d she said.\nHot items included Barbie dolls, Lego sets, the Nintendo Switch, headphones and smartwatches, according to Adobe, which tracks 1 trillion visits to retail websites and monitors sales of more than 100 million products. Electronics and toys were among the most heavily discounted items, according to Adobe.\nTotal online sales for November and December combined is set to reach $228 billion, up 4.8% from last year, according to the firm.\n(Updated with Cyber Monday sales figures in the second paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

        "text": "\n(In paragraph 23, changes \"violence\" to \"finance\")\nBy Jack Queen and Luc Cohen\nNEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Donald Trump was fined $10,000 on Wednesday after the New York judge overseeing his civil fraud trial said the former U.S. president for a second time violated a gag order barring him from disparaging court staff.\nJustice Arthur Engoron had imposed the order on Oct. 3 after Trump shared on social media a photo of the judge's top clerk posing with U.S. Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, and falsely called her Schumer's \"girlfriend.\"\nDuring a break on Wednesday in the case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James concerning Trump's business practices, Trump told reporters in a hallway, \"This judge is a very partisan judge, with a person who's very partisan sitting alongside of him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is.\"\nEngoron, surmising that Trump was referencing his clerk, called the comments a \"blatant\" gag order violation.\nTrump's hallway remarks came as Michael Cohen, his onetime lawyer and fixer, testified for a second day against him.\nBefore being fined, Trump briefly took the witness stand and told Engoron he was referring to \"you and Cohen\" during his remarks. The judge rejected the idea, echoed by Trump's lawyer Christopher Kise, that the \"partisan\" person Trump mentioned was Cohen.\n\"The idea that that statement would refer to the witness, that doesn't make sense to me,\" Engoron said. \"Don't do it again or it will be worse.\"\nTrump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the 2024 U.S. election, walked out of the courtroom after being fined.\nOn Oct. 20, Engoron fined Trump $5,000 after finding he had not taken down a post disparaging the clerk, warning that future transgressions could bring \"far more severe\" sanctions including jail. In originally imposing the gag order, Engoron said comments against his staff were \"unacceptable, inappropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.\"\nEngoron's clerk has sat next to the judge during the trial, standard practice in a New York state court.\nAlina Habba, one of Trump's lawyers, told Engoron she saw the clerk appear to roll her eyes during Cohen's testimony, and that this was \"completely inappropriate.\"\nCOHEN DEFENDS CREDIBILITY\nThe trial concerns allegations that Trump and his family business, the Trump Organization, unlawfully manipulated asset values and his net worth to dupe lenders and insurers. The case could break up Trump's business empire.\nCohen's two days of testimony marked his first face-to-face encounters with Trump in five years. Trump \"arbitrarily\" inflated the value of real estate assets to secure favorable insurance premiums, Cohen testified on Tuesday.\nSince cutting ties and becoming one of Trump's fiercest critics, Cohen has written two books and created a political podcast.\nCross-examined by Habba on Wednesday, Cohen acknowledged having a financial incentive to criticize Trump, but defended his credibility. He rejected Habba's contention that he has \"made a career\" of attacking Trump and embellishing criticism for personal gain.\n\"The more outrageous your stories are about President Trump, the more money you make,\" Habba said. \"Is that accurate, Mr. Cohen?\"\n\"No,\" Cohen responded.\nA lawyer for Trump's adult son Eric Trump - also a defendant in the case - asked Engoron to immediately enter a verdict in the defense's favor based on what he called Cohen's contradictory testimony.\nCohen said on Tuesday Trump told him to inflate his asset values but said during 2019 congressional testimony he did not recall whether he received such a directive.\nEngoron denied the request, saying it would be \"absurd\" to rule in the defense's favor midway through trial based on an \"equivocal\" statement by one witness.\n\"There's enough evidence to fill this courtroom,\" Engoron said.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in the case. Trump separately has pleaded not guilty in four criminal cases this year.\nCohen's testimony could bolster the attorney general's case though his admitted record of deceit could undermine his credibility before Engoron, who alone will decide the outcome of the bench trial. In 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to tax fraud, campaign finance violations and perjury and was sentenced to three years in prison.\nBefore the trial's Oct. 2 start, Engoron found that Trump fraudulently inflated his net worth, and ordered that companies that control crown jewels of his real estate portfolio, including Trump Tower in Manhattan, be dissolved. That ruling is on hold while Trump appeals.\nThe trial largely concerns damages. James wants at least $250 million in fines, a permanent ban against Trump and sons Eric and Donald Jr. from running businesses in New York and a five-year commercial real estate ban against Trump and the Trump Organization.\n(Reporting by Jack Queen and Luc Cohen in New York; Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder)",

Its analysis includes companies like Hormel Foods Corp. and China\u2019s New Hope Liuhe Co., which supply household names like Walmart Inc. and McDonald\u2019s Corp.\nThe food industry\u2019s climate footprint is immense, accounting for about a third of global greenhouse gases. Livestock, which releases potent methane, makes up 14.5% of worldwide emissions. The Science-Based Targets initiative, a UN-backed agency that evaluates companies\u2019 net-zero goals, recommends that the food and agriculture sector cuts emissions by 3% a year between 2020 and 2030.\n\u201cThe sector is just not on track,\u201d said Thalia Vounaki, senior manager for research and engagements at FAIRR.\nRead more: Companies Aren\u2019t Using Quick Fix to Reduce Methane Emissions\nThat underlines the need to focus on food and agriculture as world leaders gear up for the upcoming COP28 summit in Dubai later this month, FAIRR said in its report.

But overall there are varying levels of climate commitments and disclosure, it said. Almost two-thirds of the companies it analyzed didn\u2019t disclose so-called Scope 3 emissions, which include those that occur indirectly along a company\u2019s value chain.

Maybe the track will be good, maybe it\u2019ll be bad. I think don\u2019t knock it until you try it.\u201d\nAnd he defended F1 and Liberty's direction. The United States Grand Prix was the lone F1 stop in America from 2012 through 2021. The Miami Grand Prix was added in 2022 and now Las Vegas makes its debut down the Strip after two races in 1981 and 1982 that utilized a parking lot at Caesars Palace.\n\u201cI hear there\u2019s a lot of people complaining about the direction that Stefano and Liberty have been going, but I think they\u2019ve been doing an amazing job,\u201d Hamilton added. \u201cThis sport is growing massively. We\u2019ve just got to think about the impact that we have in these different places. It\u2019s not just a circus that comes here and then we leave. We should look at how we can positively impact the community here and particularly like the kids.\u201d\nVerstappen conceded he's aware of what Liberty Media is trying to do with F1, even if he prefers the focus to be on racing.\n\u201cYou can look at it two ways, business side or sport side, so I of course understand their side of it as well, but I\u2019m just voicing my opinion on the performance side of things,\" he said. \u201cWe are not stakeholders, so we just go with it. I mean, they decide what they do, right? If someone really wants to go into this direction, that you want a lot more show attached to the kind of program, I guess we have to deal with that. Let\u2019s see how long fans also like this.\u201d\nTicket prices and hotel rates had plummeted for the event last week, and although tickets still remain directly from the Las Vegas Grand Prix site, brokers are now reporting there's been a last-minute uptick in interest. Gametime said the top-priced seats are listed at $7,109 for the weekend, up from $4,613 one week ago.\nStubhub, meanwhile, said the Las Vegas Grand Prix is the best-selling F1 race of the year and ranks among the top 10 highest-selling sporting events of the entire year globally on the secondary site. Stubhub said half of the tickets sold have been since F1's Nov. 5 race in Brazil, and that 30% of tickets purchased are from California-based buyers.\nIt's the most expensive race to attend on this year's 24-event calendar.\nMercedes head Toto Wolff said he's viewing this week from two different lenses. He said \u201cthe team principal in me dreads the race\u201d because of so many unknowns of the track and the expected temperatures don't suit the Mercedes' performance.\n\u201cThe team principal, that kind of narrow-minded racing person, says it is going to be very difficult,\u201d Wolff said.\nBut as a stakeholder in F1's success, he appreciates the attempt to race in Las Vegas.\n\u201cIf we provide great racing, it's going to be entertaining,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cAnd being able to do this in the middle of Las Vegas, on the Strip, was unthinkable many, many years ago. I hope we become a fixture among the big events that happen every year in Las Vegas and we provide great racing.\u201d\nRACE FOR SECOND\nMercedes has all but given up on Hamilton's chance to catch Sergio Perez for second in the final drivers' standings.\nWith two races remaining, Hamilton trails Perez by 32 points in the standings. A race winner receives 25 points, and only the top 10 finishers are awarded points.\nHamilton acknowledged its a longshot at this point, especially considering beating Verstappen for a race win seems impossible right now.\n\u201cHe would have to have two disasters and I would have to be second, basically,\u201d Hamilton said of Perez. \u201cBut for me, honestly it really doesn\u2019t make any difference if I\u2019m second or third. I think we still had an amazing year given the car that we\u2019ve had. We never thought that we would be fighting for second in the constructors\u2019 and knocking on the door of the most dominant car, probably, of our era.\u201d\nWolff also said it would take Perez failing to finish both Saturday night and in next week's season finale in Abu Dhabi.\n\u201cIt is very difficult. If Perez DNF's, then we have a shot,\u201d Wolff said. He instead said the team is fighting hard to maintain its 20-point lead over Ferrari for second in the constructors' championship.\n\u201cI think it would be a testament considering we had an uncompetitive car that will still be able to finish second,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cWe've been always there, not where we wish to be, but second in the world championship is not something to be ashamed of.\u201d\nJET LAG\nF1 is in a brutal final stretch of the season that saw the series race three consecutive weeks in Texas, Mexico City and Brazil, with one week off before Las Vegas. F1 then goes directly to Abu Dhabi for next Sunday's season finale.\nCompounding the issue is that all on-track activity in Las Vegas is late at night, with qualifying scheduled for midnight local time on Friday and the race itself goes off at 10 p.m.\n\"It feels like I've been jet-lagged for a month and a half,\u201d said Haas driver Kevin Magnussen, who said he'd been awake for 24 consecutive hours as he's adapting to Las Vegas times and preparing for a late race.\nAdded Perez of Red Bull: \u201cI\u2019m finding it a bit crazy to stay awake so long at night. It\u2019s quite a challenge, actually, to stay awake for so long.\u201d\nIt was another one of Verstappen's complaints, as well.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense,\u201d he said of leaving Las Vegas for Abu Dhabi, where there is a 12-hour time change. \u201cI don\u2019t really get that. This is very tiring. Also the end of the season that, we have to do this.\u201d\nOF NOTE\nThe Sphere will not be dimmed while drivers are on track, but F1 and the FIA asked that yellow, red and blue not be used on the massive LED screen in an effort to not distract the drivers.\nVerstappen didn't think the Sphere would be a problem, anyway, and hoped that the images shown during the race would be entertaining. But he balked when told that driver images would be projected, including his.\n\u201cNo, that definitely is a distraction for me,\" he said. \"I might shunt in the wall, so let's not do that.\u201d\n___\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",

        "text": "\nBy Arriana McLymore\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Generative AI will be Amazon's secret weapon this holiday season, leveraging data from its more than 160 million Prime subscribers to improve ad targeting and allowing merchants to produce promotions quickly.\nApart from fast shipping and the usual discounts for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the company is betting that targeted ads, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), will draw more shoppers and advertisers to its platform.\nAmazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said on a call Thursday with analysts that machine learning is helping the company present more relevant ads to shoppers.\n\"When (advertisers) have to think about budget decisions, they're going to choose (ads) that have large volume and perform better. I think both of those are real advantages in our advertising area right now,\" Jassy said.\nThis week, the company said it is using generative AI to create better product images for advertisers, a move to direct more eyes to third-party sellers' products. The tool generates background pictures for merchandise based on product details.\nAmazon is not the first online retailer to deploy AI for advertising, but given its scale, Amazon's use is expected to increase adoption of the strategy.\nThe main benefit of generative AI will be its \"ability to show dozens, if not thousands, of variations of your ad personalized to the user,\" said Swiftly Chief Revenue Officer Andy Friedland, a former ad executive at Amazon. Swiftly is a retail technology platform.\nHe said creating different ads for various audiences can be expensive and expects Amazon's AI tools to save money for advertisers.\nBrendan Witcher, a principal analyst at Forrester, said that Amazon's generative AI ad tool will be \"good for attracting and keeping a segment of third-party sellers and brands advertising on Amazon.\"\n\nOther companies including Ascendly Marketing are using generative AI imaging tools that combine pictures of public figures with products. In a recent AI-generated campaign, deceased singer Elvis Presley is holding products from Ascendly's client, Fast Passports and Visas.\nAdding such \"whimsical imagery\" has increased social sharing significantly, Marshal Davis, Ascendly's President said. His clients are seeing a bump in sales and Google click-through rates, a trend that Amazon wants to see for its own generative AI ad tools during the holiday season.\nAnalysts expect Amazon's advertising business to earn $14.2 billion during the holiday quarter, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier, according to LSEG estimates.\nThe AI-image generator could encourage hesitant shoppers to open their wallets if targeted products are more relevant, Friedland said.\nAmazon's Prime membership, which costs $14.99 per month or $139 annually, creates a \"huge advantage\" in advertising and better targeting shoppers, which leads to customers making more frequent purchases, Witcher said.\n\"Volume of traffic is a critical component for success in online advertising,\" he said.\nAmazon forecasts holiday-quarter revenue in the range of $160 billion and $167 billion, compared to analysts' forecasts of $165.6 billion. Amazon's revenue in the fourth quarter last year was $149.2 billion.\nAmazon's AI-imaging poses a threat to smaller advertising firms and freelancers who focus on graphic design, Ascendly's Davis said.\nIf widely adopted, Amazon's AI tools could also have another downside: producing ads with similar images for different products, making it harder for sellers to stand out.\n\"This could make it difficult for brands to differentiate themselves,\" Davis said.\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York City.

        "text": "\nDisney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger has faced many challenges since stepping back into the CEO position nearly one year ago \u2014 but he's well equipped to handle them, according to his former head of streaming Kevin Mayer.\n\"Bob has his hands full,\" Mayer, who now runs Blackstone-backed entertainment startup Candle Media, said at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Tuesday.\nDisney's stock has hit multiyear lows, and activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing for multiple board seats at the company. The company's parks business is slowing, its linear TV division is declining, and its streaming business is not yet profitable.\n\"Someone like Bob, he's very capable, he's multifaceted,\" Mayer continued. \"He has a lot of range so he can handle it. Not everyone can handle a situation like that. But I think you have to be disciplined, and Bob's always been very strategic.\"\nMayer, who is currently serving as a strategic adviser to Iger, added his former boss at Disney will \"look at all his options\" and ultimately make the decision that best benefits shareholders.\n\"When you do the right things strategically for the long term that don't hurt you too much for the short term, I think you can work through these multiple issues,\" he said.\nDisney has seen shares slide about 3% since the start of the year \u2014 massively underperforming the S&P's (^GSPC) 14% gain over that same time period.\n\nMayer said the stock is reacting to multiple uncertainties \u2014 from the future of Hulu and ESPN to the ultimate fate of linear networks \u2014 but that Disney is beginning to address some of those challenges.\n\"When the stock price goes up and [Iger] articulates a great strategic vision \u2014 that will take care of most most of the problems,\" he said.\nDisney recently committed to purchasing Comcast's (CMSCA) 33% stake in Hulu and just named its next CFO after the departure of longtime executive Christine McCarthy.\nThe company also raised streaming prices for the second time this year, upping the monthly price of its ad-free Disney+ and Hulu plans by more than 20%. Mayer said he believes streaming will reach profitability \"very, very soon\" while gaming is an untapped area that the company will be able to leverage in the future.\n\"No matter what happens to those linear networks, you have a really great growth company sitting there \u2014 [it's] a really bright future,\" he said\nIger said earlier this summer the company would take an \"expansive\" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling they could potentially be sold.\nAnalysts have questioned who would want to buy them given secular declines in linear television as more consumers cut the cord, or drop their cable packages.\nMayer said he's not sure who ultimately would buy a network like ABC but said one upside to linear businesses are their profit margins, which are often in the range of 30% to 40%, sometimes more.\n\"Streaming will really never get to that profitability level,\" he said, noting even a profitable streaming company like Netflix (NFLX) will likely tap out at margins in the 25% to 30% range.\nLooking ahead, the executive said digital, more Hollywood-centric players might make the most sense as buyers for such assets \u2014 especially given the competitive environment and likelihood of consolidation.\n\"You can see consolidation among these big media companies happening,\" he said, \"You can see a Warner Bros. (WBD) combining with an NBCUniversal or with a Paramount \u2014 there are some combinations to be had there. Starz is still sitting out there owned by Lionsgate. That needs to be consolidated with someone, maybe a big digital player or by a Hollywood player.\"\nEven Mayer's own Candle Media could be acquired. Mayer laid out three visions for the entertainment company: an acquisition by a strategic buyer like Disney or Warner Bros. Discovery, a public offering, or sale to another private equity firm.\n\"Who knows, maybe KKR owns us in three years or four years,\" he said. \"But we're set up for any of them.\"\nSee the latest coverage from Yahoo Finance's Invest event:\n'Democracy is on the line': Former CNN boss on 2024 election\nFormer CNN boss Jeff Zucker: 'Cable is still powerful'\nAnthony Scaramucci on clawing back FTX's 30% stake in his firm\nConsumers will pay up for new ESPN streaming service, former Disney exec says\nCava aims to forge a new path in fast casual, says CEO\nMarriott CEO: We remain committed to the Middle East\nConsumers 'starting to cut back' on discretionary spending, Klarna CEO says\nWhat Americans get wrong about the Biden economy\n3 warning signs for Biden: Yahoo Finance-Ipsos poll\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

For the week, the index was down 0.5%, after slipping 1.9% last week.\nThe index is on course for its weakest monthly performance in a year on growing expectations the Federal Reserve is done with raising interest rates and could start cutting them next year.\nElsewhere, the Japanese yen was about flat against the dollar at 149.45, after strengthening on news that Japan's core consumer price growth picked up slightly in October.\nThe data reinforced investors' views that stubborn inflation may push the BOJ to roll back monetary stimulus before long.\nING economists said they expect the BOJ to move away from its super-accommodative stance next year.\n\"We believe that the BOJ may scrap the yield curve programme as early as the first quarter of next (year), as Japanese government bonds appear to have stabilised,\" they said.\nThe bank will \"then begin its first rate hike in Q2 2024 if wage growth continues to accelerate next year.\"\nThe nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.9% year on year in October, government data showed on Friday, against 3.0% expected by economists in a Reuters poll.\nThe euro was 0.39% higher at $1.0946 after data confirmed an initial estimate published in late October that showed Germany's economy shrank slightly in the third quarter from the previous three months.\nGerman business morale improved for a third straight month in November, data showed.\nThe single currency is pausing after gaining ground on Thursday on a series of preliminary surveys showing recession in Germany may be shallower than expected, which offset a downbeat reading on French business activity.\nSterling rose 0.57% to its highest since early September after data on Thursday showed British companies returned to growth in November, fuelling hopes Britain will avoid a recession.\nIn cryptocurrency markets, bitcoin rose 1.14% to $37,728, its highest since May 2022.

Governments in 13 of the G20 members will reduce emissions by an average of 4.5% annually between 2022 and 2030, up from a 0.8% annual fall in the five years after the Paris Agreement, MSCI said.\nMSCI's Net-Zero Tracker analysed 4,458 companies that are constituents of the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index and based in G20 countries.\nThe United Nations COP28 climate summit begins this month.

Polish truckers argue it is being applied uniformly to fully loaded EU trucks as well as empty ones, causing long waiting times for the latter.\nThe ministry said among the measures agreed between the countries was the opening of the Uhryniv checkpoint, currently operating only for passenger cars and buses, for free passage of empty trucks aimed at reducing the load on other checkpoints.\nRegistration upon arrival in the electronic system will be introduced for the Nyzhankovychi crossing, along with special passes for empty trucks at two crossings currently under blockade - Yahodyn and Krakivets.\n\"At the same time, Polish protesters insist on the operation of Uhryniv \u2013 Dolgobychow and Nyzhankovychi \u2013 Malchowice only for transport registered in the EU.

It said it would review the decision again next month.\nAramco said total hydrocarbon production in the quarter was 12.8 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.\nAramco's reported its revenue fell to $113.09 billion in the quarter from $144.99 billion a year earlier, while royalty and other tax payments fell to $14.7 billion from $24.3 billion.\nIt declared a quarterly $19.5 billion base dividend, which is paid regardless of performance. A second $9.87 billion distribution of performance-linked dividends will be paid out in the fourth quarter, based on 2022 and the first nine months of 2023.\nThe Saudi state remains overwhelmingly Aramco's biggest shareholder, and heavily relies on its generous payouts.\nThe government directly holds 90.19%, the sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF) 4% and PIF subsidiary Sanabil another 4%, according to LSEG data.\nSaudi Arabia last week reported a budget deficit of about $9.5 billion in the third quarter.

        "text": "\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has long been recognized for his unorthodox leadership strategies, and perhaps one of the most striking was his approach to employee retention and career development. Central to this philosophy was the idea that empowering employees to pursue their career goals, even beyond the company, was beneficial for both the workforce and the corporation.\nIn his 2014 Letter to Shareholders, Jeff Bezos said, \u201cNothing gives us more pleasure at Amazon than \u2018reinventing normal.'\u201d This mindset underpinned the \u2018Pay to Quit\u2019 program, an innovative measure aimed at prompting Amazon employees to reflect on their career ambitions while ensuring the company maintained a workforce that was dedicated and enthusiastic.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWith returns as high as 300%, it\u2019s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret.\nUntil 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups. Thanks to changes in federal law, this Kevin O\u2019Leary-backed startup lets you become a venture capitalist with $100.\nOriginally inspired by a similar program at Zappos, Amazon adapted the Pay to Quit program within its fulfillment centers, offering employees a sum to leave the company. Starting at $2,000, the offer increased by $1,000 each year, capping at $5,000. This unconventional tactic was presented with the tagline \"Please Don't Take This Offer,\" indicating that Amazon's preference was for employees to remain with the company.\nThe rationale behind this offer was simple yet profound: it prompted employees to deeply consider their career paths. If an individual felt their future lay elsewhere, the offer provided a financial cushion to assist them in their transition, ensuring that those who remained were truly invested in their roles and the company\u2019s vision. In the letter, Bezos said: \u201cThe goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they really want. In the long run, an employee staying somewhere they don't want to be isn't healthy for the employee or the company,\u201d affirming the program\u2019s intent to benefit both the employee\u2019s well-being and the company\u2019s health.\nTrending: From Jeff Bezos to Oprah Winfrey, the success stories began with an early investment in startups. Be part of the next big thing here.\nBezos and his team understood that an employee who stayed out of necessity rather than desire could detrimentally affect both their well-being and the organization\u2019s health.\nComplementing Pay to Quit, Bezos instituted the Career Choice program, which underscored his commitment to workforce development. By pre-paying 95% of tuition for courses in in-demand fields, Amazon empowered its employees to further their education in areas such as nursing or aircraft mechanics, regardless of their applicability to Amazon itself. The intent was to cultivate choice and facilitate personal growth, recognizing that for some, Amazon may have been a stepping stone to varied career trajectories.\nThis strategic approach to human resources was telling of Amazon's ethos under Bezos's guidance \u2014 one that prized innovation and customer satisfaction but not at the expense of its employees\u2019 career fulfillment. While investing in the continuous growth of its services and products, Amazon also invested in the potential of its workforce, acknowledging that its success was interlinked with the individuals who upheld the company's operations.\nThe \u201cwow\u201d factor, a term often associated with Amazon\u2019s customer service mantra, can also be seen as a guiding principle for investors looking at startups. Jeff Bezos began Amazon in his garage, turning a visionary idea into a powerhouse brand that transformed global e-commerce. This transformation from a small startup to a major corporate player highlights the dramatic growth that innovative new companies can achieve. Investing in startups offers individuals the opportunity to be part of the next big success story.\nThese programs reflected a larger trend in corporate management that values long-term success over short-term gains and considers employee satisfaction as a cornerstone of a thriving company. Bezos\u2019s philosophy was not without risks, yet it was initiatives like these that continually positioned Amazon as a leader in not just market share but also in its progressive approach to workplace dynamics.\nIn 2022, Amazon suspended the Pay to Quit program. This decision came after a period of unprecedented growth and change for the company, which included coping with the global e-commerce surge and labor shortages prompted by the pandemic. The suspension of the program took place against a backdrop where Amazon, like many companies, reassessed its operational and strategic priorities following peak seasons that put extraordinary demands on its workforce and infrastructure.\nRead Next:\nThe VC firm that backed Apple before its IPO in 1980 is focusing on AI \u2014 Here's how you can do the same with $1,000.\nThe $340.23 billion wine market has a brave new contender for its throne.

It plans to offer 643 million ordinary shares and wants to list on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. The shares are expected to be priced on Nov. 10.\nReuters reported in June some of the initial plans for the vehicle, which will operate as an independent company, and hold Investcorp's private market co-investments across assets including credit, real estate and private equity.\nThe planned flotation from Investcorp with $50 billion in assets under management, is the first major public deal from the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas conflict unsettled regional markets. Abu Dhabi's stock index is down just under 3% since the conflict began on Oct 7, and down 7% year-to-date.\nFounded in 1982, making it one of the oldest Middle Eastern private equity houses, Investcorp is best known in the globally for listing luxury goods brands such as Gucci and Tiffany & Co, but it has increasingly branched out into other sectors.\nInvestcorp said on Thursday that IVC Strategic Investment, a special purpose vehicle, signed up as a cornerstone investor in the IPO with a commitment of roughly $250 million.\nThe vehicle was set up to act as an aggregator of orders from certain wealth management investors and a prominent Abu Dhabi-based investor, the company added.\nThe vehicle includes the top 160 investors from the six Gulf countries and the IPO has been covered in the first hour by strong demand from local, Gulf and international institutional investors, a source familiar with the matter said.\nInvestcorp declined to comment.\nUnder the leadership of Mohammed Al Ardhi, current executive chairman, Investcorp has grown its assets under management fivefold over the last seven years by diversifying into sectors including infrastructure and insurance.\nIt listed two blank check companies on the Nasdaq, has also diversified its sources of fundraising. Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Company acquired 20% of the firm in 2017.\nInvestcorp joins a growing number of companies looking to list in the region, where there were 23 new stock market listings in the first half of 2023, more than any other first-half total since 2008.\nIPO activity in the Gulf is picking up after the pace slowed from an exceptional 2022. Saudi Arabia and the UAE led new listings that year, raising nearly $22 billion - more than half the total for the wider Europe, Middle East and Africa region, Dealogic data shows.\nBy contrast, private equity firm CVC has postponed plans for a European IPO this year due to unfavourable market conditions, a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Wednesday.\n($1 = 3.6726 UAE dirham) (Reporting by Chandni Shah in Bengaluru; Editing by Sonali Paul, Janane Venkatraman, Robert Birsel and Miral Fahmy)",

This month, OpenAI, the company that rocked the world a year ago with its launch of ChatGPT, fired and then rapidly rehired its chief executive, Sam Altman, setting off a frenzy of speculation.\nRead More: What\u2019s Effective Altruism? What Does It Mean for AI?: QuickTake\nInternal disagreements had ostensibly flared up over how ambitious OpenAI should be, in light of the potential societal risks. Altman\u2019s reinstatement puts the company on track to pursue his growth plans, including faster commercialization of AI.\nApple has said it plans to tread cautiously in the field of AI, with CEO Tim Cook saying in May that there are \u201ca number of issues that need to be sorted\u201d with the technology. And companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., have agreed to enact voluntary safeguards to minimize abuse of and bias within AI.\nStotzel said he\u2019s less worried about the risks stemming from small-scale AI startups than about those lurking in the world\u2019s tech giants. \u201cThe biggest companies could do the most damage,\u201d he said.\nOther investors share those concerns. The New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System, one of the biggest US public pension plans, said it\u2019s \u201cactively monitoring\u201d how portfolio companies use AI, according to a spokeswoman for the $248 billion plan. Generation Investment Management, the firm co-founded by former US Vice President Al Gore, told clients that it\u2019s stepping up research into generative AI and speaking daily with the companies it\u2019s invested in about the risks \u2014 as well as the opportunities \u2014 the technology represents.\nAnd Norway\u2019s $1.4 trillion sovereign wealth fund has told boards and companies to get serious about the \u201csevere and uncharted\u201d risks posed by AI.\nWhen OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched last November, it quickly became the fastest-growing internet application in history, reaching 13 million daily users by January, according to estimates provided by analysts at UBS Group AG. Against that backdrop, tech giants developing or backing similar technology have seen their share prices soar this year.\nBut the absence of regulations or any meaningful historical data on how AI assets might perform over time is cause for concern, according to Crystal Geng, an ESG analyst at BNP Paribas Asset Management in Hong Kong.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have tools or methodology to quantify the risk,\u201d she said. One way in which BNP tries to estimate the potential social fallout of AI is to ask portfolio companies how many job cuts may occur because of the emergence of technologies like ChatGPT. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen one company that can give me a useful number,\u201d Geng said.\nJonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at Boston-based Trillium Asset Management, which helped push Apple and Meta\u2019s Facebook to include privacy in their board charters, has been pressing tech companies to do a better job of explaining their AI work. Earlier this year, Trillium filed a shareholder resolution with Google parent Alphabet asking it to provide more details about its AI algorithms.\nKron said AI represents a governance risk for investors and noted that even insiders, including OpenAI\u2019s Altman, have urged lawmakers to impose regulations.\nThe worry is that, left unfettered, AI can reinforce discrimination in areas such as health care. And aside from AI\u2019s potential to amplify racial and gender biases, there are concerns about its propensity to enable the misuse of personal data.\nMeanwhile, the number of AI incidents and controversies has increased by a factor of 26 since 2012, according to a database that tracks misuse of the technology.\nInvestors in Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet\u2019s Google have filed resolutions demanding greater transparency over AI algorithms. The AFL-CIO Equity Index Fund, which oversees $12 billion in union pensions, has asked companies including Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. to report on whether they have adopted guidelines to protect workers, customers and the public from AI harms.\nPoints of concern include discrimination or bias against employees, disinformation during political elections and mass layoffs resulting from automation, said Carin Zelenko, director of capital strategies at AFL-CIO in Washington. She added that worries about AI by actors and writers in Hollywood played a role in their high-profile strikes this year.\n\u201cIt just heightened the awareness of just how significant this issue is in probably every business,\u201d she said.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\u201cThe EU may regulate AI that\u2019s tied to anything from a social media platform\u2019s recommendation systems to employment management tools, like resume-sorting software, and credit and exam scoring, deeming them \u2018high risk\u2019 applications. Such systems would need a conformity assessment and to be registered before their placement on the EU market.\u201d\nClick here for the full report by BI\u2019s Tamlin Bason.\nHigh-Risk Requirements\n(Adds Bloomberg Intelligence comment and chart in final paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nScientists and Farmers Race to Save the World\u2019s Banana Supply\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

That\u2019s lower than the 7.48% forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Insurers probably lapped up the paper as they had expressed strong interest before the auction to lock in higher yields to take care of long-term commitments.\nThe nation\u2019s burgeoning life insurance and pension fund industries, driven by an expanding middle class, are changing the landscape for India\u2019s $1 trillion sovereign debt market. India\u2019s yield curve has been nearly flat even amid record borrowing by the government as insurers stepped up purchases of long-term bonds.\nIt\u2019s the insurance companies and provident funds buying at these levels, said Murthy Nagarajan, head of fixed income at Tata Asset Management. \u201cSince we are coming toward the end of the rate hike cycle, the demand is there,\u201d he said.\nThe Reserve Bank of India received 216 bids worth 402 billion rupees for the 50-year paper, more than four times the amount on offer. It sold a total of 300 billion rupees of bonds at Friday\u2019s auction, including the 2028 and 2033 bonds.\nThe government plans to sell 300 billion rupees of the 50-year bond in the October to February period.\nThe sale of long-term bonds may help the government elongate the tenure of debt sold and keep its interest costs under control. Today\u2019s cutoff came in lower than 7.54% yield for the 40-year paper auctioned last week.\nOver one-third of the government\u2019s fiscal second-half bond supply is in papers maturing in 30-50 years. The RBI in September said it planned to add the 50-year bond in response to market demand for ultra-long papers, extending the nation\u2019s yield curve.\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year bond fell one basis point to 7.32% Friday. That on the 40-year note declined two basis points.\nIssuance of long-term paper was a very specific demand made to RBI for a long time, said Umesh Tulsyan, managing director at Sovereign Global Markets in Delhi. \u201cIf the response is good, RBI will definitely continue offering papers in the ultra-long segment,\u201d he said.\n(Updates prices, adds analyst comment)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nShipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\nFoxconn Makes Your iPhone.

        "text": "\nSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fate is now in the hands of 12 jurors, setting up a dramatic conclusion to a trial that captivated the crypto world for the last five weeks.\nThe key question the nine women and three men are likely considering after beginning their deliberations at 3:14 pm ET Thursday: Did the 31-year-old founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX intentionally defraud customers, lenders, and investors?\nProsecutors argued that\u2019s exactly what happened. Bankman-Fried, they say, deliberately stole $14 billion in customer deposits from the exchange in a scheme that he carried out with three of his top executives.\nThe group, prosecutors claimed, allowed Bankman-Fried\u2019s sister crypto trading firm Alameda Research \"secret\" backdoor access to FTX\u2019s customer deposits, then spent the money on investments, loan repayments, political donations, and real estate.\n\"It\u2019s about perception. It\u2019s about stealing. It\u2019s about greed,\" Assistant US Attorney Nicolas Roos said, describing the government's accusations during closing arguments. \"He knew Alameda was taking money from customers, and that makes him guilty of fraud.\"\nBankman-Fried, on the other hand, argued that management screwups \u2014 and not fraud \u2014 were to blame for the undoing of the cryptocurrency exchange. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.\nIn a risky gamble, he took the stand for a dramatic three days at the trial\u2019s end. He repeatedly distanced himself from certain company decisions and actions, arguing that he thought Alameda borrowing and using funds from FTX was \"permissible\" and that any \"borrows\" would be reflected on its balance sheets as liabilities to FTX.\nHe said he didn\u2019t know FTX customer funds were being used to pay off Alameda loans and trading debts until October 2022, roughly one month before the exchange collapsed.\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense lawyer, Mark Cohen, said in his closing argument Wednesday that no witnesses testified that Bankman-Fried told them to break the law. His client, he said, didn\u2019t commit crimes and had been unfairly portrayed by the prosecution as a \"villain.\"\nPoor business decisions, he said, do not equate with fraud. If jurors believe Bankman Fried acted in good faith, he said, then he can't be found guilty of any charges.\n\"We\u2019ll agree that there was a time when Sam was probably the worst-dressed CEO in the world, and had the worst haircut,\" Cohen said. \"That made his life messy,\u201d he added. \"But that\u2019s not a crime.\"\nBankman-Fried faces seven separate criminal charges ranging from wire fraud to money laundering. He also faces even more legal jeopardy in the year ahead. He is scheduled to face a separate set of criminal charges in another trial due to begin in March.\nConvictions on all counts could mean a sentence of more than 100 years in federal prison.\nSome of the most dramatic moments in his current trial came when Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon confronted Bankman-Fried on Monday and Tuesday, asking him to explain his many statements to reporters and what he did in 2022 when it became clear FTX customer funds had been used to pay off Alameda loans and trading debts.\n\"Did you fire anyone for spending $8 billion of customer deposits?\" Sassoon asked.\n\"No,\" Bankman-Fried said.\nMany times on the stand Bankman-Fried responded to questions from prosecutors with \u201cnot sure\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d At one point the judge reprimanded him: \u201cJust answer the question,\u201d Judge Lewis Kaplan said.\nRoos told jurors Wednesday during his closing argument that Bankman-Fried \"came up with a tale that was conveniently put together to exclude himself from the fraud\" at FTX. \u201cOver three days he took the stand and he lied.\"\nHe pointed to six points in time as evidence that Bankman-Fried could have exposed Alameda\u2019s \"giant\" liabilities and secret use of customer funds, yet chose instead to double down on its risk.\nIn September 2021, the prosecutors said, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison to buy back roughly $2 billion in FTX equity from its rival exchange Binance, even though FTX\u2019s revenues were $1 billion.\nBankman-Fried, they said, also commented on a spreadsheet later that same year on which Ellison calculated Alameda\u2019s net asset value to negative $2.7 billion.\nProsecutors contend that Bankman-Fried also lied on the stand when he testified that he didn\u2019t know about Alameda\u2019s use of customer funds until October.\nAll three of his top deputies, Ellison, Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang, they said, testified that they met with Bankman-Fried to discuss Alameda\u2019s $10 billion deficit in June 2022.\nRead the latest news about Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX fraud trial:\nSBF\u2019s risky gamble to testify concludes as FTX trial nears end\nSBF confronted with his own words during cross-examination in FTX trial\nSBF tells jury he didn't take FTX customer money but 'a lot of people got hurt'\nSam Bankman-Fried tells judge he relied on advice from lawyers at FTX\nSam Bankman-Fried to testify in his own defense in FTX trial\nAnother member of SBF's inner circle says crimes were committed at FTX\nProsecutors\u2019 challenge in FTX trial: A scant paper trail left by SBF\nSBF's ex-girlfriend: He 'directed me' to steal billions from FTX\nSBF's problem in FTX trial is evidence from his closest friends\nA social worker, nurse, and librarian will help determine SBF\u2019s fate in FTX trial\nSBF defense in FTX trial: 'There was no theft'\nSam Bankman-Fried faces crypto-crash fatigue with potential jurors in FTX trial\nSam Bankman-Fried begins the fight for his freedom in FTX fraud trial\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTs\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

But the UAW document noted that GM expects to invest $1.25 billion in its Lansing Grand River plant in Michigan and $391 million in its Fairfax, Kansas, plant.\nGM is considering whether to build a lower-cost version of the Bolt electric utility vehicle at the Fairfax plant in 2025 and the premium EVs for Cadillac and Chevy \u2014 including a pure electric performance model with the Corvette name \u2014 in Lansing beginning in 2027, according to sources familiar with the automaker\u2019s thinking, who asked not to be identified.\nGM said on Monday it would not comment on the tentative agreement pending ratification by the UAW.\nIn a statement, the company said, \"We'll have more specifics around product details moving forward.\"\nThe UAW summary did not specify products or timing for GM's Fairfax and Lansing plants. GM currently builds the Chevrolet Malibu and Cadillac XT at Fairfax and the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 and Chevrolet Camaro in Lansing. All of the vehicles have combustion engines.\nChief Executive Officer Mary Barra has said the current Bolt will be phased out of production at the end of this year. She said GM expects to introduce a revised Bolt with lower-cost batteries, but has not said when or where the new model will be launched.\nThe bulk of GM\u2019s U.S. investments over the contract\u2019s 4-1/2 years \u2014 about $9.1 billion \u2014 will go toward five vehicle assembly plants and seven parts plants to build electric vehicles and components, according to the UAW summary.\nBoth GM and Ford Motor in the past month have announced delays in future EV-related investments.\nGM\u2019s future product investment strategy diverges markedly from those of Ford and Stellantis, where the introduction of hybrid gas-electric models is aimed at consumers who are not prepared or cannot afford to move from combustion models to battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs. GM has not said if it plans to introduce new hybrid models in the U.S.\n\u201cGM\u2019s transition is a little trickier given their focus on BEVs,\u201d said Bill Rinna, director of Americas vehicle forecasts at GlobalData. \u201cBEV demand over the life of the (UAW) contract is certainly not a given, so kicking the can down the road on that front may be justified.\u201d\nSam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, noted the timing on some of the EV investments by GM, Ford and Stellantis was \u201cappropriately vague.\u201d\n\u201cIf the demand for EVs doesn't pick up in the next two to three years, (the timing on) some of these new products could be premature,\u201d he said.\n(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

October began with the eight-day Golden Week national holiday, where tourist spending per person remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nBeijing in late October announced an unusual 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) additional government bond issuance, earmarked for post-flood recovery and disaster prevention. While that can help support employment, \u201cit still does not seem sufficient to improve consumer demand,\u201d Von Mehren added.\nThe QuantCube indicators are based on alternative data sources, such as web search queries, transportation figures reflecting people\u2019s movements, and consumer reviews.\n\u201cDespite the government\u2019s latest financial stimulus, during October our data indicates a persistent deceleration across all sectors, notably in transportation,\u201d the company said in a report.\nMorning Consult\u2019s consumer sentiment index \u2014 which asks consumers about their personal finances, expectations for business conditions and attitudes on major household purchases \u2014 fell below 150 for the first time since February, the company said in a report.\n\u201cConfidence in China is falling fast,\u201d it added.\nIn addition, an index of private sector business conditions by CKGSB in Beijing fell slightly in October from the previous month and remained below the threshold indicating confidence. The survey covers privately owned companies that are generally relatively successful within their sectors.\nThe survey\u2019s index of profit expectations has remained below the confidence threshold for five successive months. \u201cFor profit expectations to stay below the confidence threshold for an extended period has not been often seen in our 12-year-long survey,\u201d the business school said in a report.\nOn Wednesday, China is set to release official data including retail sales for October. Several indicators are expected to improve from September in year-on-year terms, partly because many cities tightened coronavirus restrictions in October last year, resulting in a lower base of comparison.\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. economists expect retail sales growth to rise to 6.2% on-year in October, from 5.5% the previous month. But that implies a 0.5% drop in month-over-month annualized terms, compared with an increase in September.\n\u201cWith PMIs disappointing and exports declined by more than expected, we think activity probably softened from September to October,\u201d Goldman economists led by Hui Shan wrote in a note. Combined with signs of weaker housing and steel demand in early November, \u201cgrowth appears to be hitting a soft patch\u201d in the first half of the fourth quarter, they said.\nRetail sales growth generated by China\u2019s biggest online shopping festival, which runs from October through November, was slower than in previous years. The value of sales rose 2.1% from last year, significantly lower than the 14% increase recorded in 2022, and apparently the lowest in many years, Nomura Holdings Inc. economists led by Lu Ting said in a note citing third party data.\nChina\u2019s property sector also shows signs of worsening this month, Nomura said, with sales in 21 major cities falling 44% from 2019 levels in the early weeks of November. That\u2019s similar to the pace of contraction in July, before Beijing started a new round of property easing measures, the bank said.\n\u201cBeijing needs to take stronger action to rescue the property sector and clean up local government debt to secure a more sustainable recovery,\u201d it added.\nThe next scheduled opportunity to assess the government\u2019s support for the economy also comes on Wednesday, when the central bank reveals the volume of funds it will inject into the banking system through its medium-term lending facility, and the interest rate on that lending. China\u2019s money-market saw a liquidity scare in late October.\n\u201cWeak inflation and the recent liquidity squeeze call for stronger policy support this week,\u201d Carlos Casanova, senior Asia economist at Union Bancaire Privee in Hong Kong, wrote in a note, adding that a 10-basis-point cut to the lending rate from its current 2.5% level was possible. \u201cFrankly speaking, the sooner the better,\u201d he said.\n(Updates with additional data and comment from sixteenth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\nA German Startup Races Google to Develop a Universal Translator\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Retail investors, with about eight times the amount of cash in their accounts that funds now have, have dominated sales.\nNext up to list are one of the country\u2019s biggest independent fuel retailers, offering an amount that\u2019s twice as much as all the other sales combined, and a gold miner that was sanctioned by the UK this week. EuroTrans, with 26.5 billion rubles of shares for sale, plans to list on Nov. 21, according to a statement on its website. On Thursday, gold miner Yuzhuralzoloto said it will offer a 5% stake to investors this month. The company may seek a valuation of 120 billion rubles, RBC newswire reported last week.\nVodka maker Kaluga Distillery Kristall and Mosgorlombard, a pawnshop chain based in the capital, also said they\u2019re planning to list shares soon. Five companies are preparing IPOs before the year ends, depending on market conditions, Interfax reported, citing the Moscow Exchange\u2019s Natalia Loginova.\nDifferent Market\n\u201cExpectations of a large number of IPOs are finally coming true, but the market has completely changed,\u201d Maxim Orlovsky, co-chief executive officer for Russia at Renaissance Capital investment bank, said by phone. Without institutional investors as buyers, the deals will remain small, he said.\nAfter surging to a decade high of more than $3 billion sold in Moscow and London in 2021, the IPO pipeline shut when President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in Feb. 2022. Funds fled the market as the US and EU piled on sanctions. The only sale last year, by e-scooter firm Whoosh, raised $33 million.\nBut for citizens who\u2019ve remained at home, the desire for a return on their savings is aligning with the needs of local companies suddenly facing severe limitations on their access to capital. While banks offer interest rates of around 10% on deposits, the MoEx Russia stock index has jumped 50% this year, one of the best performances among stock indexes tracked by Bloomberg globally.\nRussian money isn\u2019t very welcome abroad, making domestic options for investment more appealing, said Oleg Vyugin, a former senior official at the central bank and Finance Ministry. \u201cNot all the money left Russia, but the gate has closed.\u201d\nMore than 80% of the trading volume in shares now comes from private investors, according to the Moscow Exchange. Retail accounts soared to 8 trillion rubles at the end of the second quarter, 48% higher than a year earlier, according to the Bank of Russia. At the same time, funds that used to dominate IPOs manage only about 1 trillion rubles.\nMore Deals\nMore and possibly bigger deals may be encouraged by a government directive to Russian investors who scooped up assets from departing foreign businesses \u2014 that some of those shares must be listed. Such share offers should be held one to three years after deals are closed, Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said in October.\nThe multitude of small players may increase the risks in Moscow\u2019s market, while \u201cthe absolute dominance of retail investors makes trading itself more volatile,\u201d said Elena Kozhukhova, an analyst at Veles Capital.\nFor now, though, retail investors are taking advantage of the opportunities, with companies such as Astra Group PJSC nearly doubling in the opening days of trading.\n\u201cI secured my best IPO trade result ever,\u201d Vladimir G., 36, said of Astra, asking not to provide his full name to protect his financial security.

        "text": "\n(Adds details from blog post in paragraph 7, background on Cruise in paragraphs 11-13)\nBy David Shepardson and Ben Klayman\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, Nov 14 (Reuters) - General Motors' Cruise driverless car unit said on Tuesday it will pause all supervised and manual car trips in the U.S. and expand the scope of investigations at the robotaxi operator in the aftermath of an accident that initially led to the suspension of driverless vehicle operations.\n\"This orderly pause is a further step to rebuild public trust while we undergo a full safety review,\" Cruise said in a blog post. \"We will continue to operate our vehicles in closed course training environments and maintain an active simulation program in order to stay focused on advancing AV technology.\"\nCruise also said in the blog post that Exponent, an independent engineering firm previously hired to perform a technical root cause analysis of the Oct. 2 incident, would expand that probe to include a \"comprehensive review\" of its safety systems and technology.\nIn addition, Cruise will hire an outside safety expert to review the company's safety operations and culture, according to the blog post. That would be in addition to the permanent chief safety officer it previously said it will hire.\nThe actions followed a Cruise board meeting in San Francisco on Monday, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Cruise previously said it had retained law firm Quinn Emanuel to examine Cruise's response to the accident.\nCruise also said in the Tuesday blog post it will bring in GM general counsel Craig Glidden as chief administrative officer to oversee several teams at Cruise while retaining his responsibilities at the Detroit automaker.\nThe teams under Glidden include communications and finance, according to the blog post. Some investors felt the communications department mishandled Cruise's explanations for what happened during the Oct. 2 accident, where one of Cruise's self-driving vehicles braked but did not avoid striking and dragging a pedestrian who had previously been struck by a hit-and-run driver.\nCruise had been operating an Uber-like service with unmanned vehicles, primarily in San Francisco, but following the accident it halted that service. Tuesday's blog post showed that suspension was expanded to vehicles operated by human safety drivers, affecting about 70 vehicles.\nCruise is competing with Alphabet's Waymo unit and others to develop the robot cars for wider production and deployment. Perfecting the technology will take years of real- world testing, but the companies have run into resistance from some lawmakers and citizens who fear the vehicles are as yet unproven and pose a safety risk.\nGM CEO Mary Barra, who also sits on Cruise's board, has told investors Cruise could generate $50 billion in revenue by 2030. The operation lost more than $700 million in the third quarter of this year as it has increased spending to expand operations to 15 U.S. cities.\nOn Nov. 8, GM\nrecalled 950 driverless cars\nto upgrade software and said more recalls would likely be issued. Two days earlier, GM said it\nwould halt production\nof its fully autonomous Cruise Origin van.\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last month it was investigating the safety of Cruise vehicles.\nEarlier in October, the\nCalifornia Department of Motor Vehicles\nordered Cruise's driverless cars to be removed from state roads, calling them a public hazard and alleging the company had \"misrepresented\" the safety of the technology.

Several veterans told Bloomberg that paperwork delays by their mortgage servicers had pushed them into delinquency and foreclosure.\nUnder the forbearance program, borrowers could work out agreements with their servicers to repay the arrears, called loan modifications. For veterans, one potential modification, called a partial claim, allowed them to defer paying those arrears until their mortgage matured. While that program ended in October 2022, the VA said Friday that it would now allow veterans to obtain \u201ca zero-interest, deferred-payment loan\u201d for the duration of the pause.\n--With assistance from Ann Choi and Polly Mosendz.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nInflation Raging in Triple Digits Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\nThe Impact and Cost of Musk\u2019s Endorsement of Antisemitism on X\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

It's the fourth straight quarter these funds saw negative net outflows.\n\"There have always been multiple drivers of motivation for investors and sustainability-focused funds, some of which I think we would expect to be more durable than others,\" Alyssa Stankiewicz, associate director of sustainability research at Morningstar and the report's author, told Yahoo Finance. \"Perhaps rising energy prices and broader global macroeconomic events over the past year and a half have weakened the rationale for keeping those in the portfolio if you're looking specifically at performance drivers.\"\nA political backlash against ESG investing \u2014 which combines risk factors from carbon emissions to corporate governance to labor disputes under one framework \u2014 also didn't help sentiment.\nAlthough investors pulled money from traditional funds as well, the outflows were more significant among those with sustainable labels. Overall US long-term funds contracted by $3.9 billion during the third quarter, representing a mere 0.02% decline. Sustainable funds, meanwhile, fell by 0.85%.\nFurthermore, more sustainable funds closed in the third quarter than were opened \u2014 the first time this has happened in recent history. Three new sustainable funds were launched during the quarter while 17 others either closed or removed their sustainable mandates, as investors turned their focus to other themes such as options trading, emerging markets, and artificial intelligence.\nThe decline in sustainable funds and beaten-down clean energy stocks has been especially stark given the boom in the space between the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2022. Assets in sustainable funds fell to $298.8 billion in Q3 of this year, down 17% from the record $358.2 billion in Q1 2021.\nThe passage of President Biden's landmark climate law over a year ago, which has begun delivering substantial investment in the green transition, was expected to provide another tailwind for clean energy stocks. But some of that optimism has faltered in recent quarters.\n\"We haven't necessarily seen that play out, which is a bit of a surprise,\" Stankiewicz said about the expected investment boost from the law.\nA few funds have been especially hard-hit. The passively managed iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) and the actively managed Parnassus Core Equity fund (PRBLX) saw the greatest outflows of their kind, losing roughly $2.1 billion and $600.7 million, respectively, during the quarter. The largest climate fund, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), has also struggled, losing more than $794.2 million this year.\nNevertheless, there were pockets in the sustainable fund landscape that continued to see demand.\nUS sustainable bond funds netted positive flows for the third straight quarter, drawing in $639.3 million, as the Fed strengthened its commitment to a \"higher for longer\" policy stance for interest rates.\nAnd while the appetite for ESG has been shaken, there continued to be demand for climate-specific funds focused on specialized areas such as clean energy.\nGlobally, climate funds pegged to the green transition grew by 30% to $534 billion from the beginning of 2022 through June of this year, according to Morningstar, though demand for these funds in the US lagged that in Europe and China.\n\"Climate funds definitely have seen stronger demand than the broader sustainable funds landscape in the US,\" Stankiewicz said. \"2022 was certainly not as strong, but it was positive. So we're definitely seeing more consistent demand for those funds.\"\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "text": "\nA look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nIf investors were wondering why Federal Reserve rhetoric remains so doggedly hawkish, the latest U.S. consumer price inflation report on Tuesday will likely explain why.\nAccording to consensus forecasts at least, U.S. headline inflation is expected to have retreated sharply again in October back toward midyear lows around 3.3%. A near 15% drop in retail gasoline prices since late September should help see to that.\nBut underlying 'core' inflation is expected to stay stickier at an unchanged annual rate of 4.1% last month and still more than twice the Fed's target.\nThere's been more encouraging news on inflation expectations, however, with the New York Fed's latest survey of household sentiment showing a one-year inflation outlook slipping to 3.6% last month and as low as 2.7% over five years.\nBut the Fed may want to hang tough long enough into a slowing economy to ensure that inflation is squeezed back to its 2% goal. Goldman Sachs, for example, reckons the hard part of the Fed's fight is over but it may not start cutting rates until the fourth quarter of 2024.\nFutures markets are still more optimistic - seeing the first quarter-point cut fully priced by July and 75 basis points of easing in total in the mix by the end of next year. The worrying state of U.S. small businesses will be seen in the NFIB report for October out later today.\nLong-term investors think the Fed is just playing a holding game and ultimately the cooling economy will allow it to ease enough to make today's juicy bond yields worth snapping up.\nBank of America's latest monthly funds survey shows global asset managers holding their biggest overweight position in bonds since March 2009 - and some 61% think yields will be lower in 12 months' time than they are now.\nAnd perhaps the negative tilt on October core inflation going into today's release leaves more room for a positive surprise. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields hovered just above 4.60%, the dollar index was a touch softer and S&P500 futures were marginally positive ahead of the bell.\nAlthough U.S. crude oil prices have backed up again in recent days, they remain 18% below September's peak and year-on-year losses are running at almost 10%.\nThe global demand picture remains hard to parse.\nThe International Energy Agency on Tuesday raised its oil demand growth forecasts for this year and next despite the weakening economic picture.\nThe euro zone economy contracted 0.1% as expected in the third quarter, meantime, raising the prospects of a technical yearend recession and contrasting with the U.S. boom during the same quarter. However, the data wasn't all bad and employment continued to increase in the bloc in Q3.\nElsewhere, the focus shifts to California as China's President Xi Jinping starts his first U.S. visit since 2017 ahead of Wednesday's summit with President Joe Biden in San Francisco during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering there this week.\nThe White House said on Monday that Biden and Xi will discuss strengthening communication and managing competition.\nIn the background for XI is the country's ongoing property sector and local debt concerns. Reuters reported on Tuesday that China has ordered its local governments to halt public-private partnership projects identified as \"problematic\" and replaced a 10% budget spending allowance for these ventures with a vetting mechanism as it tries to curb municipal debt risks.\nIn Japan, the yen continued to stalk 33-year lows set in October last year at 151.94 per dollar - with markets wary of Bank of Japan intervention should it plunge through there. Japan's Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government would take all necessary steps to respond to currency moves, repeating his mantra that excessive swings were undesirable.\nIn corporate news, Home Depot reports earnings in a big week for U.S. retailers.\nIn deals, Glencore sealed a deal for a 77% stake in Canadian miner Teck Resources' steelmaking coal business for $6.93 billion in cash, paving the way for a spin-off of the commodity giant's own coal business.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:\n* U.S. Oct consumer price inflation, NFIB Oct small business survey\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Chicago Fed chief Austan Goolsbee all speak; Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr testifies before Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill speaks\n* China's President Xi Jinping starts visit to United States\n* U.S. corporate earnings: Home Depot\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Christina Fincher, mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

        "text": "\nXi Jinping is having dinner Wednesday night with American CEOs at a time of rising US skepticism about China's tighter business controls and concerns about that country's slowing economy.\nIt was a much different story eight years ago, the last time Xi held court with American executives on US soil.\nIn 2015, American CEOs flocked to see the Chinese president while downplaying concerns about China\u2019s state control of its economy, which was then churning out a 7% GDP growth rate.\nThat trip included a tour of Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) campus and a picture of Xi standing next to several rows of executives lining up to meet him, from Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) then-CEO Jeff Bezos to Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook.\nZuckerberg, who was eager at the time to reverse Facebook\u2019s ban in China, greeted Xi first and spoke in Mandarin, according to reports from that trip. \"Did you feel the room shake?\" Cook was even quoted as saying about Xi's entrance.\nBut this week \u2014 with Facebook still banned in China and Zuckerberg himself recovering from an ACL tear \u2014 the Meta head is steering clear of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is one of several leaders not planning to meet with Xi after years of tenser relations with China.\n\"At that time, in 2015, we were a lot more optimistic,\" said Stanford professor Herbert Lin, adding that there had been a hope then that China would eventually be integrated into a larger global economic system.\nLin said companies were well aware of the risks in previous eras but simply calculated they couldn\u2019t pass up the Chinese market.\nNow, \"that belief is now a lot more shaky.\"\nOngoing geopolitical issues between the US and Chinese governments may only exacerbate the tensions in the coming years as Xi tries to simultaneously staunch the outflow of capital from the country while maintaining rigid political controls. Foreign direct investment in his nation turned negative in new data released this month.\nThe US-China Business Council\u2019s annual member survey released in September found that \"geopolitics is the single largest issue weighing down business sentiment\" alongside concerns about China\u2019s domestic policies.\nWhile the pomp and circumstance that comes with any visit is sure to remain this time around, the tone and tenor of Xi\u2019s interactions with CEOs are widely expected to be different.\nIn 2015, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gave Xi a personal tour of his company\u2019s Redmond campus. This week, perhaps the most notable item on his itinerary is a panel alongside the leaders of Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, and Chile as those nations aim to woo some US investment away from China.\nMicrosoft, to be sure, has an ongoing presence in China that stretches back decades and Nadella himself has maintained a bullish outlook for Asia in recent comments.\nOther CEOs from Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Elon Musk to Citigroup\u2019s (C) Jane Fraser are also seen as likely to seek an audience with XI this week as they try to maintain and grow the presence of their companies in China.\nBut Xi clearly has a challenge before him as he prepares to speak to assembled CEOs Wednesday night at a dinner reportedly organized by the National Committee on US-China Relations and the US-China Business Council.\n\"Beijing is trying to counter a US narrative that China has become 'uninvestable,'\" said Reva Goujon, a director at Rhodium Group, in a recent client note.\nBut she added in an interview that Xi still has opportunities to dangle before CEOs.\n\"If you're in the EV business, for example, this is still the largest EV market in the world,\" she said.\nNicholas Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicts that Xi\u2019s speech Wednesday \"will say lots of good things about how open China is [but] the reality has moved in the opposite direction.\"\nIn spite of Xi\u2019s rhetoric and some desire to goose the inflow of foreign investment and expertise, the Chinese leader has prioritized state control for years now, Lardy said, and many in the business community are now catching on to that shift.\n\"I don't think there's going to be much uptake\" for Xi\u2019s message, he added.\nXi is also sitting down Wednesday with US President Joe Biden in a meeting that the White House hopes will help stabilize the relationship between the two superpowers.\nBut White House officials have warned the bilateral meeting has little chance of offering breakthroughs on economic concerns from trade tensions to semiconductor export controls.\nWhile Xi and Biden are hoping to announce some progress on issues like cooperation on AI, curbing fentanyl, and resuming military communication, few expect the larger issues to be resolved anytime soon.\n\"People really do believe China is an adversary,\" says Lin of the overall political climate. \"It's the one place where both Republicans and Democrats really agree.\"\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\n(Adds final news conference)\nBy Jan Strupczewski\nBRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - France and Germany will discuss later this month how strict new EU fiscal and debt rules should be, to create a basis for a pan-European deal by the end of the year, the finance ministers of both countries said on Thursday.\nThe talks are part of a revision of the EU's fiscal rules that underpin the euro and that financial markets are watching closely. The rules have been suspended since 2020 but are to be reinstated from 2024, and EU governments want to update them before they kick in again.\nEU finance ministers discussed changes to the rules at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday and would meet again for an extra session at the end of the month to boost the chances of a deal at their next regular meeting scheduled for Dec. 8.\n\"There is still a final mile to walk but, like the pilgrims in the Camino de Santiago (ancient pilgrimage routes), we're starting to see the cathedral at the end of the way,\" Spanish Finance Minister Nadia Calvino, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency and is therefore in charge of finding a compromise, told a news conference.\n\"We see there is a very strong commitment by all member states to contribute to work together and to reach a balanced deal before the end of the year,\" she said.\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner said before the meeting that his French counterpart Bruno le Maire would visit him later in November to discuss the \"level of ambition\" between the two biggest EU countries who are key to reaching a deal.\n\"A Franco-German initiative could lead to a mutual understanding among all EU member states,\" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said.\nBALANCING DEBT REDUCTION AND INVESTMENT\nThe Stability and Growth Pact rules limit budget deficits to 3% of GDP and debt to 60%, with disciplinary steps for those not cutting any excess fast enough.\nMany European governments far exceed the limits now, while also needing to invest to fight climate change.\nThe European Commission initially proposed that any decline in debt over four years should be acceptable. Germany insisted on minimum annual amounts, called benchmarks, that would be the same for all.\nBerlin also wants the new rules to say governments should aim for budget deficits below 3%, creating a buffer to cover unexpected events. Lindner told reporters that the idea of buffers on debt to GDP and annual deficits was acknowledged in the latest compromise proposal by the Spanish presidency.\n\"So now it is about numbers, not only instruments so I am optimistic but much more work needs to be done,\" he said.\nEU ministers also are haggling over the balance of power between them and the European Commission and how to effectively enforce the rules.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno le Maire said ministers wanted a deal on new rules by the end of the year.\n\"The EU needs those new rules. The old ones are outdated, obsolete. We need to fund our investments, to guarantee the EU's financial stability,\" he said.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Rockstar Games Inc. is preparing to reveal plans for its next entry in the seminal Grand Theft Auto franchise as soon as this week, with a trailer to come in December. As we await further details on GTA VI, here\u2019s a look back at its pedigree and why its release is among the most hotly anticipated events on the games calendar.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAn Opioid-Like Drink Is Masquerading As a Wholesome Alcohol Alternative\nXi Jinping\u2019s \u2018Old Friends\u2019 from Iowa Get a Dinner Invitation\nTrump\u2019s 40 Wall St. Loan Transferred to Special Servicer\nUS Credit-Rating Outlook Changed to Negative by Moody\u2019s\nThe Diamond World Takes Radical Steps to Stop a Pricing Plunge\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about GTA VI?\nGrand Theft Auto VI will be the next major release in a series of action video games initiated in 1997, where the player takes on the role of an antihero avoiding police and driving and shooting across a simulacrum of a real-world city. It was one of the earliest and best attempts at creating what\u2019s become known as an open-world game, where players can choose their own path and missions through the game.\nOver the years, GTA games have grown into a wider cultural phenomenon reaching beyond gaming, as its distinctive style earned loyal players and fans from across the entertainment industry. The series has sold more than 405 million copies, Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. said in August.\nWhat do we know about GTA VI\u2019s content?\nPrevious entries in the series have involved running around recognizable recreations of cities like Miami, Los Angeles and New York. Back in 2022, people familiar with Rockstar\u2019s plans said early designs for the game had called for the inclusion of territories based on large swathes of North and South America. But the company curtailed those ambitions and cut the main map down to a fictionalized version of Miami and its surrounding areas. The game will feature two protagonists, a man and a woman.\nA number of clues to the new game were gleaned from an extensive leak of videos and screenshots posted to the web by a hacker in September 2022. People familiar with the game\u2019s development said the cache showed pre-release footage of the game and Rockstar moved quickly to scrub the images from the internet. Gaming site Games Radar reported that the leak pointed to a modern-day Vice City setting (from the game bearing the same name, based on Miami), fresh gameplay mechanics and improved AI.\nWhen will GTA VI be released?\nIn 2022, industry analysts expected GTA VI would be out sometime in Take-Two\u2019s 2024 fiscal year, which runs from April 2023 through March 2024, but even then developers were skeptical. Video games are notorious for release delays enforced by hitches in development, as highlighted by the ambitious Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s tortured path to release.\nAs of now, we have no idea. The leaked gameplay footage last year was rough and riddled with bugs, with Rockstar promising to introduce the game to players properly \u201cwhen it is ready.\u201d Rockstar doesn\u2019t appear in desperate need to rush out the game: its GTA Online service hosted more users in June this year than in any other June outside of the pandemic, Take-Two said in August.\nHow valuable is GTA VI to Rockstar?\nGTA VI\u2019s predecessor, 2013\u2019s Grand Theft Auto V, was the fastest entertainment release in history to reach $1 billion in retail sales and the best-selling game in the US over the past decade, according to Take-Two. Rockstar has built a growing GTA Online multiplayer platform and community, which it is increasingly monetizing with a paid GTA+ subscription offering, launched in March 2022.\nThe release of GTA VI is expected to drive similar, if not larger, retail sales at its outset and to catalyze growth in revenue from online services and in-game content.\nHow different can we expect GTA VI to be from its predecessors?\nThe franchise\u2019s first two entries featured a distinctive top-down view before it transitioned to 3D graphics with Grand Theft Auto III. In subsequent iterations, Rockstar has invested in developing a more cinematic style, bringing in the voices of celebrities and ramping up the filmlike qualities of its narratives. With competition in this genre of Hollywood-like games rising significantly over the past decade \u2014 as highlighted by Sony Group Corp.\u2019s The Last of Us Part II \u2014 players will expect Rockstar and Take-Two to elevate their own standards and those for the industry.\nBudgets for top-tier titles like GTA and TLOU 2 now habitually stray into nine figures, and given the long-term earning potential indicated by GTA V, Rockstar is likely to invest everything it can in ensuring GTA VI is a similar success.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 While the scandals in the cryptocurrency industry seem to never end, Washington policymakers appear to have little interest in pushing through legislation to codify the structure of the industry.\nThe latest shoe to drop is Binance\u2019s multibillion dollar settlement with U.S. authorities and the resignation of its CEO this week. Before that came the conviction of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried for stealing billions from customers and the implosion of smaller crypto companies that cost investors large sums of money.\nWhen cryptocurrencies collapsed and a number of companies failed last year, Congress considered multiple approaches for how to regulate the industry in the future. However, most of those efforts have gone nowhere, especially in this chaotic year that has been dominated by geopolitical tensions, inflation and the upcoming 2024 election.\nIn fact, the appetite for new rules seems more diminished than ever.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday that existing regulations already apply to cryptocurrency at a news conference announcing the $4 billion settlement with Binance: \u201cI think today's actions show that we are serious about enforcing strong regulations that are already in place to make sure that illegal transactions are not fostered by cryptocurrency entities,\" she said.\n\u201cIn cases like this, where there are violations of a truly egregious nature,\u201d she said \u201cof course we want to make sure our tools stay up to date and are adjusted so that we can address emerging threats. We believe we have strong tools and we have been increasingly deploying them to counter this type of abuse.\"\nAnd a group of more than 100 mostly Democratic lawmakers in October said the responsibility for preventing the use of crypto to finance terrorism belongs to the White House, calling for the Biden Administration to act.\nChangpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a felony related to his failure to prevent money laundering on the platform. Zhao stepped down and Binance admitted to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and apparent violations of sanctions programs, including its failure to implement reporting programs for suspicious transactions.\nAs part of the settlement agreement, the U.S. Treasury said Binance will be subject to five years of monitoring and \u201csignificant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance\u2019s complete exit from the United States.\u201d Binance is a Cayman Islands limited liability company.\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called the settlement one of the largest corporate penalties in the nation\u2019s history.\nNow the largest entities in crypto over the past couple of years \u2014 Binance, Coinbase and FTX \u2014 are either in severe legal trouble, under investigation or have collapsed altogether.\nWithout Congress, federal regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission have stepped in to take their own enforcement actions against the industry, including the filing of lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance and Kraken, three of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. Kraken was charged by the SEC this week with operating its crypto trading platform as an unregistered securities exchange.\nAdditionally, PayPal received a subpoena from the SEC related to its PayPal USD stablecoin, the company said in a filing with securities regulators this month. The firm says its cooperating with authorities.\nSome members of Congress have opposed the SEC's actions on crypto, arguing that the SEC needs congressional approval to justify going after bad actors, or that crypto should be regulated more like a commodity, which would be under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. One or both of those arguments have been made by legislatures in both political parties.\nSens. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and John Boozman, R-Ark., proposed last year to hand over the regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether to the CFTC. Stabenow and Boozman lead the Senate Agriculture Committee, which has authority over that regulator.\nSo while Congress has made proposals it has yet to act. Part of the reluctance to act stems from lawmakers' inability to coalesce around what crypto is in the first place, and further, the opposition from some powerful members of Congress to crypto altogether.\nOne of those members opposed is Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, chair of the Senate Banking Committee.\nBrown has been highly skeptical of cryptocurrencies as a concept and he\u2019s been generally reluctant to put Congress\u2019 blessing on them through legislation. He\u2019s held several committee hearings over cryptocurrency issues, ranging from the negative impact on consumers to use of the currencies to fund illicit activities, but has not advanced any legislation out of his committee.\n\u201cAmericans continue to lose money every day in crypto scams and frauds,\u201d Brown said in a statement after Bankman-Fried was convicted. \u201cWe need to crack down on abuses and can\u2019t let the crypto industry write its own rulebook.\u201d\nIn the House, a bill that would put regulatory guardrails around stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies that are supposed to be backed by hard assets like the U.S. dollar \u2014 passed out of the House Financial Services Committee this summer. But that bill has gotten zero interest from the White House and the Senate.\nConsumer advocates are skeptical about the need for new rules, or the usefulness of crypto itself.\n\u201cThe lawlessness if not criminal activities of crypto will continue and increase until all prosecutors, regulators and elected officials force the industry to act like all other law-abiding people and firms in the financial industry,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a nonprofit that works to \u201cbuild a more secure financial system for all Americans,\u201d according to its website.\nWhereas some analysts say the fraud trials, settlements and criminal charges signal a new era for crypto development.\nYiannis Giokas, senior director of digital assets at Moody\u2019s Analytics said the settlement agreement between U.S. Authorities and Binance \u201cmarks the end of an era.\u201d\n\"With digital currencies becoming more mainstream and institutional players entering the space, regulations and enforcement will become stricter to ensure compliance and consumer protection. Yesterday\u2019s development marks the same inflection point that we saw earlier at the intersection of the .com and post-.com eras.\u201d",

        "text": "\n(Updates with quote from First Quantum's CEO in paragraphs 6 and 7, fresh protests in paragraph 10)\nBy Valentine Hilaire and Divya Rajagopal\nNov 24 (Reuters) - Panama's top court started deliberations on Friday to rule on several constitutional challenges to First Quantum Minerals' contract for the Cobre Panama mine, an outcome keenly watched by the global copper market and investors.\nFirst Quantum has faced massive protests since the Panama government signed a new contract for the Cobre Panama mine on Oct. 20, amid allegations of corruption and lack of transparency in the negotiations. The company has denied any wrongdoing.\nCobre Panama is one of the world's biggest and newest copper mines, producing about 1% of global copper supply.\nA majority of lawyers surveyed by Reuters this month said the Supreme Court is likely to rule against the company, citing a precedent. The court has not given a timeline to release the verdict, but some lawyers and officials expect a decision in the coming days or weeks.\nA ruling against First Quantum will have huge implications. The uncertainty has already wiped about C$10 billion ($7.3 billion), or 50% of its market value, in about a month, impacted copper prices and could be a blow to the Central American nation as the mine accounts for about 5% of its GDP.\nFirst Quantum's \"fall-back legal position is very strong,\" Tristan Pascall, the company's CEO, said in an interview with LatAm Investor published on Thursday when asked whether the miner would receive fair compensation if the government closes the mine.\n\"Over the long-term we've invested more than $10 billion in turning the Cobre Panama into a world-class asset,\" Pascall was quoted as saying.\nChina's Jiangxi Copper Co is First Quantum's biggest shareholder.\nThe demonstrations have turned into an anti-government movement, with protesters demanding an end to all mining activity in the country.\nA protest is expected to be held outside the court later on Friday.\nThe movement has also gained support from activist Greta Thunberg and Hollywood actor Leonardo Di Caprio, who last weekend shared a video from an environmental group that called for the Supreme Court to cancel the contract.\nOn Thursday, First Quantum said the mine is not operating at commercial levels, following blockades by protesters at a key port that have prevented the miner from receiving shipments of coal that power the site and other supplies.\nThe contested contract provides First Quantum a 20-year mining right with an option to extend for another 20 years, in return for $375 million in annual revenue to Panama.\nIf the court deems the contract unconstitutional, Panama would be in a tricky spot, lawyers said, as the government on Nov. 3 signed a bill banning all new mining concessions and extensions. That would prevent the two parties from negotiating a new deal.\nThe contract was inherited by First Quantum in 2013 after it became the operator of the mine. However, Panama's top court in 2017 deemed unconstitutional the law under which First Quantum was operating the mine.\nThe ruling was upheld in 2021, resulting in last month's fresh deal with the government.\n($1 = 1.3718 Canadian dollars)\n(Reporting by Valentine Hilaire and Divya Rajagopal; Writing by Denny Thomas; Editing by Sonali Paul)",

        "text": "\nBy Julie Zhu\nHONG KONG, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets struggled for momentum on Thursday, after heavy gains this week, as expectations for a pause in Fed policy tightening remained intact despite U.S. data pointing to strength in parts of the economy.\nU.S. economic data this week has left investors in the same state of confusion about Fed policy as they have been in for weeks. Retail sales proved strong while producer prices inflation, coming soon after the below-forecast core inflation, reinforced the disinflation theme and supported views of a peak in U.S. rates.\n\"With inflation, labour market and retail sales data now published for this month, and expectations for an FOMC hike in December and January priced at zero, a huge amount of information has been digested by markets in a very short time,\" analysts at ANZ said in a note.\n\"A period of consolidation seems warranted, especially if Fed officials push back against the recent easing in financial conditions.\"\nEarly in the Asian trading day, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2%. The index is up 7.1% so far this month.\nAustralian shares were down 0.33%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index slid 0.36%.\nThe MSCI Asia ex-Japan index, MSCI Emerging Market index and Nikkei all posted their biggest gains in a year, of 2.5% or more, on Wednesday.\nChinese industrial and retail numbers calmed nerves and lifted mainland stocks on Wednesday, with both data beating expectations in October even as the underlying economic picture highlighted significant pockets of weakness with the crisis-hit property sector continuing to forestall a full-blown revival.\nChina's blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.1% lower in early trade. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.35%.\nWhile markets didn't react specifically to the news, investors also heard from the first meeting in a year between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday, that the two leaders had agreed to resume military-to-military communications and cooperate on anti-drug policies.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. stocks closed slightly higher, as the inflation data reinforced investor hopes the Fed is done raising interest rates, while retail stocks were boosted by an upbeat forecast from Target.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.47%, the S&P 500 gained 0.16% and the Nasdaq Composite narrowed earlier gains to end flat.\nMoney market traders have fully priced in the odds that the U.S. central bank will keep rates steady in December, as per CME Group's Fedwatch tool. They also see the first rate cut of the cycle to kick off in May 2024.\nInvestors are increasingly pricing in more rate cuts next year with bond yields and the dollar coming under downward pressure. Some of that reversed on Wednesday, with Treasury yields and the dollar rebounding slightly from the previous session's fall.\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 4.5117% compared with its U.S. close of 4.537% on Wednesday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 4.8991% compared with a U.S. close of 4.916%.\nIn currencies, the European single currency was up 0.1% on the day at $1.0852, having gained 2.61% in a month, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies of other major trading partners, was up at 104.33.\nU.S. crude dipped 0.55% to $76.24 a barrel. Brent crude fell to $80.75 per barrel.\nGold was slightly lower. Spot gold was traded at $1958.49 per ounce.\n(Reporting by Julie Zhu and Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

The fact that just a handful of companies have powered this year\u2019s market gains has fanned concern about the rally\u2019s sustainability. Yet it\u2019s these firms that tend to have the strongest fundamentals to weather the Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening campaign, he said.\n\u201cGoing into year-end now, we\u2019d much rather own the largest-cap names,\u201d Yadava said on Bloomberg Television\u2019s ETF IQ on Monday. \u201cSector by sector, if you throw a dart, we\u2019d rather own the stock that\u2019s in the larger-cap than the smaller-cap because that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the positive earnings revisions, that\u2019s where the balance-sheet strength is, and those are the themes we want to own right now.\u201d\nDespite a turbulent few months, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is still about 40% higher in 2023, a dominant performance fueled by the likes of Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. That group has powered the S&P 500 roughly 14% higher this year as well.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s model portfolios have about $100 billion tracking them. Salim Ramji, global head of iShares and index investments at the firm, predicted in July that the overall industry could grow to $10 trillion over the next five years, from about $4.2 trillion.\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s models briefly went underweight on equities after Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s meltdown in March and the financial industry stress that followed, they started to \u201cedge back into stocks\u201d during the summer, Yadava said. Although the initial thinking was that the rally in the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks would broaden out, that hasn\u2019t happened, he said.\nModel portfolios are a booming corner of the money-management industry. They bundle funds into off-the-shelf packages and have gained popularity with advisers and professional managers alike. As a result, allocation shifts by the biggest providers are sometimes suspected to be behind dramatic flows of money.\nBlackRock\u2019s model portfolio team isn\u2019t alone in the logic of gravitating toward the market\u2019s biggest firms. Large tech companies don\u2019t need to tap the bond market as much as their smaller peers, insulating them from some of the pressure dealt by the Fed\u2019s hiking cycle, according to BNY Mellon Wealth Management\u2019s Alicia Levine.\n\u201cI still think you have to be in large-cap tech. Large-cap tech America is about growth without needing to borrow, so that\u2019s an important story and that\u2019s part of the reason this sector rallied so hard the first part of the year as the Fed was hiking,\u201d Levine, the firm\u2019s head of investment strategy, said on Bloomberg Television.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nWho\u2019s Ready for a Trump-Biden Rematch?

Target, which had given a strong holiday quarter outlook on Wednesday, fell 0.9%, with the broader S&P 500 consumer staples index down 1.1%.\n\"The markets are just taking a step back after some disappointing guidance from Cisco and Walmart,\" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest.\n\"Both are seen as kind of a backbone of their respective industries. So it calls a little bit into question the health of the consumer and maybe the health of the technology sector.\"\nWall Street's main indexes have rallied this week as evidence of cooling inflation in the world's largest economy fueled hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve was most likely done hiking interest rates.\nIn a data-packed week that saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq hitting an over three-month high, markets also took comfort from the U.S. Senate's passage of a stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown.\nKeeping declines in check, U.S. Treasury yields moved lower after the Labor Department's report showed weekly jobless claims had risen more than expected, cementing bets that the Fed will not need to raise rates further.\nThe slip in Treasury yields lifted some megacap stocks, with Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet up between 0.7% and 1.1%.\nWhile money markets have fully priced in a probability that the Fed will hold rates steady in its December meeting, they see about 62% odds of an at least 25-basis-point rate cut in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nEnergy led declines among the 11 major S&P sectors, falling 2.9% and hitting a four-month low as crude prices dropped over 4%.\nAt 11:49 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 135.23 points, or 0.39%, at 34,855.98, the S&P 500 was down 9.34 points, or 0.21%, at 4,493.54, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 44.38 points, or 0.31%, at 14,059.45.\nAmong other stocks,\nPalo Alto Networks fell 6.9% after the cybersecurity company forecast its second-quarter billings below market expectations due to inflationary pressures.\nMacy's shares climbed 6.8% as the department store operator's quarterly sales beat analysts' estimates.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.87-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.35-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 14 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 79 new lows.\n(Reporting by Shristi Achar A and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Pooja Desai)",

The government has already moved to delay a ban on sales of new petrol cars, but officials have repeatedly said ministers were not giving up on the overall targets, just being more \"pragmatic\" in how they get there.\nSunak confirmed in an introduction to the speech he would bring in legislation to hold North Sea oil and gas licensing rounds annually - something Labour has ruled out - to help \"the country to transition to net zero by 2050 without adding undue burdens on households\".\nThat was one of only two new bills expected to be presented to the House of Commons this week, with the remainder being legislative plans rolled over from the previous parliament.\nSunak's government plans to phase out tobacco sales to young people in England and, in an attempt to win over younger voters, press ahead with reforms to the housing market, outlawing no-fault evictions for renters.\nBut Sunak faces an uphill struggle to win back voters, with Labour holding an around 20-point lead in the polls. His party is mired in allegations of sex scandals, under scrutiny over its actions during the COVID-19 pandemic and deeply divided over its strategy before the next election.\nHe is hopeful his agenda can turn things around.\n\"We have turned the corner over the last year and put the country on a better path,\" Sunak said in his introduction.\n\"But these immediate priorities are not the limit of our ambition. They are just the foundations of our plan to build a better future for our children and grandchildren, and deliver the change the country needs.\" (Reporting by Elizabeth Piper, Andrew MacAskill, additional reporting by Alistair Smout, Kylie MacLellan, Paul Sandle, Sarah Young, Kate Holton; Editing by Alex Richardson, Jon Boyle and Christina Fincher)",

The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe pause affects, among others, shotguns and optical sights and the Commerce Department said last month an urgent review will assess the \"risk of firearms being diverted to entities or activities that promote regional instability, violate human rights, or fuel criminal activities.\"\nThe letter, which was also signed by Armed Services Committee chair Mike Rogers, Oversight chair James Comer and Transportation and Infrastructure chair Sam Graves, seeks answers by Nov. 13 to a series of questions and argues that \"continuing this pause will only weaken law-abiding civilians and hand criminal actors a monopoly of force.\"\nThe Republican party has\nconsistently defended gun ownership\nrights under the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, while many Democrats have called for new restrictions after a series of mass shootings.\nThe letter also said the decision could \"adversely affect thousands of Americans whose jobs involve the manufacturing or shipping of these items to overseas locations.\"\nThe halt covers most of the guns and ammunition that could be purchased in a U.S. gun store. U.S. companies that sell firearms, including Sturm Ruger & Co., Smith & Wesson Brands and Vista Outdoor, could be affected by the export ban.\nOverseas customers include distributors and stores that sell firearms. Exporters can continue to submit license requests during the pause, but they will be \"held without action\" until the pause is lifted.\nThe pause does not affect previously issued export licenses, the Commerce Department said. For shipments to government clients, exporters must name specific end users, while applications with unnamed government, military, and police users will be \"returned without action.\" (Reporting by David Shepardson, editing by Deepa Babington)",

Subsidies for fossil fuels totalled $1.3 trillion, and substantially more if counting the societal cost of dealing with emissions and pollution.\nReport co-chair Vera Songwe, an ex-World Bank economist, said the report's focus was on how to advance the investments needed for the world to catch up on Paris Agreement targets to cap global warming well under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F)\n\"That is why we are emphasising speed and scale \u2013 the more we wait, the more expensive it comes,\" she said.\nRECORD OIL AND GAS PROFITS\nThe report's authors said taxes on the record profits made by oil and gas companies, from higher energy prices that followed the Ukraine war, were unlikely to get political traction, in part because many, such as the UAE's ADNOC, are state-owned.\nCo-chair Nicholas Stern, professor at LSE/Grantham Research Institute, said there was a compelling case for energy companies to make voluntary contributions.\n\"I think that moral obligation is something that will be emphasised at COP28, and indeed before and after,\" he said.\nThere are growing calls for a carbon levy on shipping, which transports around 90% of world trade and accounts for nearly 3% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.\nAviation, which accounts for some 2-3% of emissions, is not directly covered by the Paris Agreement but the air transport sector has pledged to align itself with its goals.\nThe panel estimated that emerging and developing economies excluding China will need a total $2.4 trillion investment a year by 2030 - four times current levels - to make the energy transition, adapt their economies and deal with climate damage.\nWhile the bulk of that can be raised domestically, it called on rich nations - already at least two years late on a promise of $100 billion to help poorer countries with climate change - to triple the volume of concessional loans on offer by 2030.\nThe report characterised private finance in emerging and developed countries as \"dismally low\", while development banks were criticised for poor cooperation with the private sector, often competing with it on projects seen easiest to launch.\n(Writing and reporting by Mark John; editing by Barbara Lewis)",

The greenback, however, pared gains after data showed the U.S. manufacturing sector remained weak in November. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its manufacturing PMI was unchanged at 46.7 last month. It was the 13th consecutive month that the PMI stayed below 50, which indicates contraction in manufacturing. Post-manufacturing data, U.S. rate futures on Friday priced in a 56% chance of a rate cut by the March meeting next year, compared to 43% late on Thursday, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. For the May meeting, U.S. rate cut chances surged to 84%, from about 76% the day before. Softer inflation data in both the United States and the euro zone on Thursday reinforced expectations that both central banks might be done raising interest rates in their battle against price rises and led traders to bet on earlier cuts next year. Goldman Sachs on Friday said it now expected the European Central Bank to deliver its first rate cut in the second quarter of 2024, compared to an earlier forecast of a cut in the third quarter of next year. Investors will have their sights trained on a talk due to be given by the Fed's Powell later on Friday for any clues about the future path of interest rates in the U.S. \"That would be the Fed's last opportunity to set the record straight for the meeting before the blackout period,\" said Erik Bregar, director, FX & precious metals risk management, at Silver Gold Bull in Toronto. \"So I think you're just seeing a paring back of post-CPI (consumer price index) decline in the dollar.\" Currency movements were more muted on Friday, after month-end trades on Thursday contributed to bigger swings, analysts said. The U.S. dollar index - which tracks the currency against six major counterparts - was last up 0.2% at 103.69, after clocking its weakest monthly performance in a year in November. Mixed economic data across Europe failed to set the tone for the euro, with a survey showing a downturn in euro zone manufacturing activity eased slightly last month but remained deeply in the red. Britain also reported contraction in manufacturing, but an improved reading for a third straight month. The euro was last down 0.4% at $1.0842, while sterling was flat at $1.2617. Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.1% to 148.09 yen. The yen was on course for its third straight week of gains, pulling it away from the near 33-year low of 151.92 per dollar touched in the middle of November. Rising expectations of the Bank of Japan abandoning its ultra-easy monetary policy next year along with a drop in U.S. yields have buoyed the Asian currency in the past few weeks. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin continued to strengthen, rising to a fresh 18-month high of $38,839.

How do we stop them? How much weight do we want them to lose to get the benefit?\" he said.\nPatients on Wegovy experienced decreases in C-reactive proteins, an indication of inflammation, similar to those reported with cholesterol lowering statins, which are known to significantly lower heart risks, researchers reported.\n\"The cardiovascular benefit (of Wegovy) is a combination of many factors, but I would call out glycemic (blood sugar) control, weight loss and inflammation,\" Martin Lange, Novo Nordisk's head of development, said in an interview.\nIn the 17,604-patient trial with a mean duration of 33 months, almost 1,500 of those taking Wegovy discontinued treatment due to adverse side effects, mostly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea and vomiting, compared to 718 patients in the placebo group, according to the study.\nThough the trial was not conducted to test weight loss, participants lost an average of nearly 10% of their total body weight. Novo said patients in the heart study were not required to track diet and exercise as they are in obesity trials.\nThe study showed Wegovy to be safe and well-tolerated in line with previous semaglutide trials, Novo said.\nIt was unclear whether the results could be applied to all GLP1-class drugs or were specific to semaglutide, Barclays analyst Emily Field said in an interview.\nLange said he expected the company's application to have Wegovy's label updated to include the heart benefits to be approved in the U.S. in the first half of next year and in the EU in the second half. Drug regulators can update the information on medicine labels to include new data or reflect new indications for use after initial approval.\nU.S. and UK drug regulators approved Eli Lilly's rival weight-loss treatment on Wednesday, which had previously been approved and marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes.

NAR faces at least two other similar proposed class actions.\nIn Monday's lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan, plaintiff Monty March said commissions on Manhattan residential sales remain a stable 5% to 6% even as home prices soar, with the average apartment price topping $2 million by early 2022.\nMarch said sellers using REBNY's listing service should not pay 2.5% to 3% commissions to buyers' brokers given how commissions are lower in \"fully competitive\" markets such as Brooklyn, where they are negotiated separately and average 1%.\nREBNY General Counsel Carl Hum said the group was reviewing the complaint with its lawyers, and was confident its listing service's practices and procedures \"abide by all relevant laws.\"\nCorcoran and Douglas Elliman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nMarch said he paid inflated commissions when he recently sold property on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

        "text": "\nBy Howard Schneider and Michael S. Derby\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as policymakers struggled to determine whether financial conditions may be tight enough already to control inflation, or whether an economy that continues to outperform expectations may need still more restraint.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said the situation remained something of a riddle, with U.S. central bank officials willing to raise rates again if progress on inflation stalls, wary that a rise in market-based interest rates may begin to weigh on the economy in a significant way, and trying not to disrupt, any more than necessary, an ongoing dynamic of steady job and wage growth.\nIn a press conference after the end of a two-day policy meeting, Powell said the better course of action for now, given the uncertainties, was to maintain the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, and see how job and price data evolve between now and the next policy meeting in December.\nRoughly 20 months into the Fed's aggressive tightening of monetary policy, Powell said it remained unclear whether overall financial conditions were yet restrictive enough to tame inflation that he still considers to be far above the central bank's 2% target.\n\"We're not confident that we haven't, we're not confident that we have\" reached that sufficiently restrictive plateau, Powell told reporters. \"Inflation has been coming down, but it's still running well above our 2% target ... A few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence.\"\nAnnual inflation, based on the Fed's preferred measure, was 3.4% in September for the third month in a row. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, it was 3.7%, little changed from August.\nAsked if the Fed maintained a bias towards hiking rates versus keeping policy on hold, Powell responded \"that's the question we're asking. Should we hike more?\"\nMARKET RATES IN FOCUS\nBut the Fed chief also acknowledged that a recent market-driven rise in Treasury bond yields, home mortgage rates and other financing costs could have their own impact on the economy as long as they persist, and Fed officials will be watching those effects closely as they consider whether to hike the central bank's policy rate again.\n\"These higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households and businesses. Those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists,\" Powell said, taking particular note of 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages that are nearing 8%, close to a 25-year high.\nPowell's comments elaborated on a policy decision and statement that, while leaving the Fed's benchmark rate unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, also took stock of what he called the \"outsized\" 4.9% annual pace of U.S. economic growth in the July-September period after a surge of consumer spending.\n\"Economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter,\" the U.S. central bank said in its statement after policymakers unanimously agreed to leave rates unchanged. The language marked an upgrade to the \"solid pace\" of activity the Fed saw as of its September meeting.\nU.S. stocks climbed after the release of the policy statement and closed higher on the day, while the U.S. dollar pared gains and ended flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell and traders of short-term U.S. interest rates added to bets the Fed was done raising its policy rate and would start cutting rates by June of next year.\n\"The statement leans to the dovish side,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. \"The fact that they left rates unchanged for the second time in a row suggests the Fed might leave rates unchanged in December. And if they do, that means the Fed is done.\"\nThough markets think the Fed's rate-hiking campaign may be finished, data pointing to a stronger-than-expected economy and labor market have kept the prospect of another hike on the table.\nPowell noted that much about the economy's recent performance was constructive, with low unemployment and rising wages fueling more demand for goods and services and more job creation - the sort of virtuous cycle that, within bounds, leads to self-sustaining growth.\nThe issue for the Fed is whether conditions remain so robust that progress on inflation stalls or even reverses.\n\"It has been good,\" Powell said. \"We've been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this ... The question is, how long can that continue?\"\nThe odds, he said, are that a slowdown of some sort will be needed, with the Fed committed to finding the policy stance that makes it happen.\n\"It is still likely ... we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market ... to fully restore price stability,\" Powell said.\nHis comments throw the focus onto upcoming employment and inflation data, with the release of the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Friday the first major piece of data that will shape the Fed's deliberations for its December meeting.\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)",

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- UBS Group AG reported stronger-than-expected client inflows in its wealth-management business, boosted by the first signs of stabilization at Credit Suisse as it carries out an expensive and complex integration of its former rival.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWeWork Goes Bankrupt, Signs Pact With Creditors to Cut Debt\nTrump Testimony Called a \u2018Broken Record\u2019 by Judge: Trial Update\nTrump's Wealth Has Jumped $500 Million Since He Left the White House\nS&P 500 Set for Longest Winning Run in Two Years: Markets Wrap\nTrump Shouts at Judge and Lawyers in Wild Day on Witness Stand\nThe unit saw net new money of $22 billion in the third quarter, compared with an estimate of $14 billion. About $3 billion of that was at Credit Suisse\u2019s wealth arm, its first positive client flows in a year and a half.\nThe Zurich-based bank posted a net loss of $785 million for the three months to September, its first quarterly loss in almost six years, as costs to absorb Credit Suisse came in at $2 billion. A further $1 billion of charges are expected to come in the fourth quarter.\nUBS Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti is seeking to chart a path through the biggest merger in finance in decades, readying the combined bank for a strategic revamp due to be announced in February. The bank\u2019s shares have gained by about 30% this year as investors back Ermotti\u2019s plan to integrate Credit Suisse\u2019s profitable businesses while winding down the rest.\nThe bank is in \u201cfull execution mode\u201d around the integration, Ermotti said on a call with analysts.\nUBS shares were up 3.6% at 11:10 a.m in Zurich.\nProfit at the asset management unit came in lower than expected. UBS said ongoing uncertainty over the economic outlook, including central-bank rate increases and geopolitical tensions, may affect wealth-management clients\u2019 willingness to conduct transactions in the fourth quarter.\nInvestment Bank\nUBS reported an increase in investment banking revenues of 36% compared to the same period last year, driven by fees from mergers & acquisitions and leveraged capital markets. In trading, UBS\u2019s revenues for equities decreased 3% from the prior year reflecting a difficult market that contributed to mixed results across Wall Street banks.\nFor its smaller fixed income, rates and currency trading business, UBS\u2019s revenues were down 37% from the prior year, faring much worse than US trading houses.\nUBS has signaled it will shutter roughly two-thirds of Credit Suisse\u2019s investment bank as it absorbs its former rival, including almost all its trading operations as part of plans to exit businesses that don\u2019t fit with its existing strategy.\nUBS said it accelerated the wind-down of assets inherited from Credit Suisse that it doesn\u2019t want to continue, reducing risk-weighted assets by $6.4 billion in the quarter.\nThe Swiss bank has said it will give an update on its share buyback program in February, around the same time as full-year results.\nOn costs, UBS said it had already met its goal for this year of reducing expenses by some $3 billion. Personnel costs jumped however, including some $500 million in retention payments to key Credit Suisse staff.\nUBS is seeking to cut the combined workforce as a way to slash costs. Managed headcount dropped by more than 4,000 in the third quarter and is down by about 13,000 against the total figure the two banks would have had as a combined entity at the end of last year, according to the report.\n\u201cUBS has made clear progress since the close of the deal, but it continues to face a huge task,\u201d said Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Vontobel Holding AG in Zurich.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\nCore UBS flows and momentum in the acquired Credit Suisse business are pivotal for deal success, with an encouraging $3 billion of Credit Suisse wealth net new money in 3Q implying an acceleration to $2 billion in the final month or so of the quarter. That follows $1 billion through Aug. 28, along with $17 billion of wealth-deposit inflows ($7 billion in the final month after $10 billion in the first two months). Combined wealth flows, deposits and Swiss deposits all improved in 3Q. An acceleration of the noncore wind-down is positive, with $1 billion of integration costs expected in 4Q after $2 billion in 3Q.\n\u2014 Alison Williams, BI banking analyst\n--With assistance from Allegra Catelli.\n(Adds Ermotti quote in fifth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nWho\u2019s Ready for a Trump-Biden Rematch?

It's telling us that the Fed is done, there's nothing left for it to do here,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at hedge fund Great Hill Capital at New York.\n\"This is what the Fed was looking for, slowing inflation, slowing labor market and the economy's holding up at the same time.\"\nFollowing the data, traders erased bets the Fed will raise borrowing costs any further and piled into bets on rate cuts starting by May. They are currently pricing in a 100% chance the Fed will hold rates next month, as per CME Group's Fedwatch tool.\nU.S. Treasury yields dropped, with the two-year yield , which best reflects short-term interest rate expectations, sliding to two-week lows.\nThat in turn lifted megacap-growth stocks such as Nvidia , Alphabet, Amazon.com and Tesla up between 1.6% and 4.7%.\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped 4.7% to hit an over six-week high. Rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities that have been hammered this year, rose 5.5% and 3.4%, respectively.\nWall Street's main indexes have seen a strong rebound in November on expectations that U.S. interest rates were near their peak, even as Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week left the door open to further tightening.\nFocus is also on negotiations by U.S. lawmakers over a funding bill as they face an end-of-week deadline to fund the federal government.\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said on Tuesday he thinks the House will pass a short-term spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown beginning on Saturday.\nAt 12:00 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 494.67 points, or 1.44%, at 34,832.54, the S&P 500 was up 80.73 points, or 1.83%, at 4,492.28, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 282.21 points, or 2.05%, at 14,049.95.\nSnap Inc shares jumped 7.7% following news that Amazon.com will allow Snapchat users in the United States to buy some products listed on the ecommerce company directly from the social media app.\nHome Depot gained 6.6% after the U.S. home improvement chain beat quarterly profit estimates.\nFisker slid 22.5% after the electric-vehicle startup slashed its 2023 production forecast.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 11.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.93-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 41 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 101 new lows.

        "text": "\n(Reuters) - U.S. robotaxi operators could face increased regulatory scrutiny after an accident involving Cruise, the self-driving cab business of General Motors, forced the company to pause service.\nIn October, one of Cruise's driverless cabs was not able to stop in time from hitting a pedestrian who had been struck by a hit-and-run driver, raising safety concerns around the use of robotaxis.\nHere's a quick rundown on the sector:\nWhat are robotaxis?\nRobotaxis are autonomous self-driving cabs which require no human interaction to operate the vehicle. The ride-hailing service can be availed through mobile apps.\nHow does it work?\nThe vehicles use machine-learning models and advanced systems to process information from technologies such as cameras and LiDAR sensors, as well as pre-existing data, to navigate around specified areas without a human driver required to make decisions.\nWhen did driverless cabs become a reality?\nAlphabet's Waymo was the first to kick off robotaxis in the United States in 2017.\nCruise followed with its first driverless ride service last year in San Francisco, and slowly expanded to include Phoenix, Arizona, and Austin, Texas.\nCompanies offering the service\nRobotaxi services are currently offered in specific areas within the United States by Waymo, Uber Technologies and Lyft.\nWhile Cruise paused its U.S. services for a safety review, it continues to undertake testing in closed course training environments, along with public testing overseas.\nAmazon.com is also testing its robotaxi service, Zoox, to handle traffic lights, intersections and drive at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour.\nWhen will robotaxis become mainstream?\nWhile robotaxis offer the convenience of lower operating costs for cab operators, there are regulatory approvals and technological hurdles that need to be overcome before the cabs are widely adopted across states.\nLucid's CEO in 2021 said it was likely to take a decade before self-driving taxis would be deployed on roads, and they weren't \"coming anytime soon even with the most advanced sensing systems in the world\".\nThe use of driverless cabs also raises the prospect of job losses and could attract pushback from unions.\nAre robotaxis safer than other cars?\nOn paper, robotaxis are supposed to offer better safety due to their advanced machine-learning models and a host of sensors designed to monitor traffic activity.\nNewer models of the vehicles were also tuned to offer smoother braking and acceleration curves to give passengers a better ride.\nHowever, the unpredictability of human drivers and pedestrians sometimes makes it difficult for the current autonomous driving tech to take quick decisions and navigate around hazards.\nRegulatory hurdles facing robotaxis\nCommercializing fully autonomous vehicles, especially robotaxis, has been harder than expected with tough regulations, complicated technology and heavy investments forcing some to cut jobs.\nSome companies such as Ford and Volkswagen-backed Argo AI have also shut shop.\n(Reporting by Nathan Gomes in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",

        "text": "\n(Reuters) -PricewaterhouseCoopers affiliates in Hong Kong and China and a Chinese audit firm have agreed to pay a total of $7.9 million in fines for failures related to audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, the U.S. accounting watchdog said on Thursday.\nThe penalties come over a year after Beijing and Washington struck a landmark deal that has allowed the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect the books and records of Chinese companies listed in New York for the first time. While the fines are relatively small, they are among the biggest the watchdog has ever issued and indicate that the inspection deal, a decade in the making, is working as hoped.\n\"The days of China-based firms evading accountability are over. The PCAOB is demonstrating that we will take action to protect investors in U.S. markets and impose tough sanctions against anyone who violates PCAOB rules and standards, no matter where they are located,\" said PCAOB chair Erica Williams in a statement.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers firms in Hong Kong and China agreed to pay a total of $7 million for violating quality control standards after they failed to detect or prevent extensive answer-sharing on mandatory training courses, the PCAOB said.\n\"After becoming aware of these issues, the firms investigated these matters promptly and took remedial action,\" the PwC affiliates said in a joint statement, noting they reported the problems to the PCAOB.\nThe PCAOB also fined Shandong Haoxin Certified Public Accountants Co., Ltd. and four accountants $940,000 for violations including issuing a false audit report and failing to maintain independence from a public company client. The individuals are also facing industry bars of varying lengths, the PCAOB said.\nHaoxin did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\nThe U.S. has for years worried that the auditors of U.S.-listed Chinese companies were falling down on the job, putting investors at risk. But Beijing had resisted allowing the PCAOB access to its auditors' records, citing state secrecy concerns.\nIn August 2022, the two countries - spurred on by a new U.S. law that threatened to kick potentially 200 Chinese companies off U.S. exchanges - finally agreed a framework for beginning inspections of eight audits.\nIn May, the PCAOB said it found a slew of deficiencies in audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies performed by PwC in Hong Kong and KPMG. At the time, the watchdog said it was common to find issues when first accessing a country's auditors.\nIt did not disclose which companies' audits it had selected for inspection, but Reuters has previously reported that Alibaba Group Holding and Yum China Holdings were among them.\nThe PCAOB's inspection in the region continue and the regulator continues to have \"complete access\" in its inspections, Williams said on Thursday.\n\"American investors are better protected when the PCAOB can audit the auditors of issuers listed in the United States,\" U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by Michelle Price, Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski)",

The hurdles have come down significantly.\"\nThe Berkshire investment in Mitsubishi and rivals Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsui and Sumitomo has also focused global attention on Japanese stocks in general and coincided with a push by the Tokyo Stock Exchange for improved use of capital that has seen companies boost dividends and buy back shares.\nThe result has put Japanese equities soundly back in fashion for the first time in years, as investors bet that more companies are serious about improving governance and returns.\nThe Nikkei has jumped 29% so far this year, outperforming both the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100. Tellingly, the index has also hit its highest since 1990 - near the peak of the asset bubble when Japan was still a more dominant force in the global economy.\nAttitudes about the need to engage with external stakeholders - including investors - are now changing rapidly in Japan, at least among larger firms, Kobayashi said, highlighting how Japan Inc has become less insular in recent years.\nGOING DIRECT\nMitsubishi is now reaching out directly to overseas investors, something it used to outsource to brokerages. It met with some 100 foreign investors in the past half a year, Kobayashi said, double the number from last year.\n\"We're taking an active targeted marketing approach, particularly towards foreign investors,\" he said.\nAppointed as the trading house's first chief stakeholder engagement officer in April, Kobayashi is now focused on wooing investors who focus on growth, not just value.\nBerkshire, synonymous with the philosophy of value investing that Buffett studied at Columbia University under Benjamin Graham, said in June it increased its stakes to average more than 8.5% in the five trading houses.\nBerkshire first announced roughly 5% stakes in August 2020, with Buffett saying the trading houses \"have many joint ventures throughout the world and are likely to have more\".\nSince then Mitsubishi's share price has more than trebled, when dividends are included, although that's still slightly behind top performer Mitsui, which has returned 237%, according to LSEG data. The Nikkei has returned 54%.\nThe trading houses are \"a cross-section of not only Japan, but of the world\", Buffett told the Nikkei newspaper in April, adding they were \"similar to Berkshire\".\nStill, Mitsubishi is trading at a price-to-book ratio of just a little over 1, or at almost no premium to the value of its assets.\n\"We have yet to make the case for our growth potential to the market,\" Kobayashi said.\n(Reporting by Anton Bridge and Miho Uranaka; Editing by David Dolan and Miral Fahmy)",

Even the costliest state, California, now registers an average price below the $5.00 level, at $4.92, down $0.52 from one month ago.\nThe steady decline is a boon for the Biden administration during a year when consumers have seen the cost of shelter, food, and services go higher. \u201cThe president wants \u2014 specifically as we go into Thanksgiving and then into Christmas and New Year's and the holiday season \u2014 to give the American public and the American family a break.

Hamas said it had handed over 13 Israelis, three Thais and one with Russian citizenship.\nThe release of the hostages - part of a larger group captured when Hamas fighters rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7 - was mirrored by the freeing of 39 Palestinians, all of whom are teenagers, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA.\nHamas said it wanted to extend the truce if serious efforts were made to increase the number of Palestinian detainees released by Israel.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said he hoped the pause in fighting can go on as long as hostages are getting released. He hoped more Americans would be released by Hamas although he did not have firm news.\nBiden said the 4-year-old hostage, Abigail Edan, had witnessed her parents being killed by Hamas fighters during their Oct. 7 raid into Israel and had been held since then.\n\"What she endured is unthinkable,\" Biden said at a news conference in the U.S.\nAbigail was on her way to the hospital for checks, Israel's Channel 13 said. Her grandfather, Carmel Edan, told Reuters he \"simply could not believe\" she had been returned, thanking Biden \"for all the help he's offered us.\"\nPalestinians gave the freed prisoners a jubilant reception in Ramallah, according to WAFA.\nOmar Abdullah Al Hajj, 17, one of the detainees released Sunday, said he'd been kept in the dark about what was happening in the outside world.\n\"I can't believe I'm free now but my joy is incomplete because we still have our brothers who remain in prison, and then there is all the news about Gaza that I am having to learn about now,\" he told Reuters.\nThe four-day truce is the first halt in fighting in the seven weeks since Hamas killed 1,200 people and took about 240 hostages back into Gaza.\nIn response to that attack, Israel has vowed to destroy the Hamas militants who run Gaza, bombarding the enclave and mounting a ground offensive in the north. Some 14,800 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday met security forces inside the Gaza Strip. He also said he spoke to Biden about the hostage release, adding that he would welcome extending a temporary truce if it meant that on every additional day 10 captives would be freed. However Netanyahu said he also told Biden that, at the end of the truce, \"we will return with full force to achieve our goals: The elimination of Hamas, ensuring that Gaza does not return to what it was; and of course the release of all our hostages.\"\nFRAGILE DEAL\nSunday's hostage release follows the liberation of 13 Israelis on Saturday - six of them women and seven of them teenagers or children. The youngest was 3-year-old Yahel Shoham, freed with her mother and brother, although her father remains a hostage.\nIsrael freed 39 Palestinians the same day - six women and 33 teenagers - from two prisons, WAFA said.\nA Palestinian source has said up to 100 hostages could ultimately go free.\nQatar, Egypt and the United States are pressing for the truce to be extended beyond Monday but it is not clear whether that will happen.\nClashes and recriminations have threatened to torpedo the existing deal.\nThe killing of a Palestinian farmer in the central Gaza Strip had earlier added to those concerns. The farmer was killed when targeted by Israeli forces east of Gaza's long-established Maghazi refugee camp, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\nThe armed wing of Hamas also said on Sunday that four of its military commanders in the Gaza Strip had been killed, including the commander of the North Gaza brigade, Ahmad Al Ghandour. It did not say when they had been killed.\nViolence has also flared in the West Bank, where Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians, including two minors and at least one gunman, late on Saturday and early Sunday, medics and local sources said.\nEven before the Oct. 7 attacks from Gaza, the West Bank had been in a state of unrest, with a rise in Israeli army raids, Palestinian attacks, and violence by Israeli settlers in the past 18 months. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7, some in Israeli air strikes.\nIMMENSE RELIEF\nThe deal survived an earlier threat when Hamas' armed wing said on Saturday it was delaying hostage releases until Israel met all truce conditions, including committing to let aid trucks into northern Gaza.\nSaving the truce took a day of diplomacy mediated by Qatar and Egypt, which President Biden also joined.\nHamas' al-Qassam Brigades also said Israel had failed to respect terms for the release of Palestinian prisoners that factored in their time in detention.\nCOGAT, the Israeli agency for civilian coordination with the Palestinians, accused Hamas itself of delaying trucks trying to deliver humanitarian aid to northern Gaza at a checkpoint.\n\"To Hamas, residents of Gaza are their last priority,\" it said on Sunday.\nQatari diplomats are now on site in Gaza to supervise the entry and delivery of their country's aid, Qatar's Foreign Ministry said.\nA U.N. official who took part in a humanitarian convoy to northern Gaza said on Sunday aid groups were on track\nto deliver the biggest shipment in over a month\n, describing thin, gaunt residents slaking their thirst as soon as water arrived.\n\"People are so desperate and you can see in adults' eyes they haven't eaten,\" the U.N. children's agency's James Elder told Reuters by video link from southern Gaza after returning from Gaza City.\n\"There's just this immense relief. Literally people as they get water start drinking the water immediately,\" he said. \"They're thirsty. They've been thirsty for days.\"\nEven as the aid deliveries flowed north, Elder said he saw hundreds of Gazans heading in the other direction, fearing the renewal of Israeli bombardments if the four-day truce is not prolonged.\n\"People are so terrified that this pause won't be continued,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Emily Rose, Emma Farge, Bassam Masoud, James Mackenzie, Aidan Lewis, Ari Rabinovitch, Adam Makary, Nidal al-Mugrabi and Moaz Abd-Alaziz; Additional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah, Nafisa Eltahir in Cairo, Andy Sullivan in Washington, Moira Warburton; Writing by Raphael Satter, Keith Weir and Giles Elgood; Editing by Angus MacSwan, Nick Macfie, Louise Heavens, David Gregorio and Diane Craft)",

        "text": "\nBy Ankur Banerjee\nSINGAPORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the back foot on Friday, while the euro nursed steep losses as traders weighed data that showed inflation was easing, stoking expectations that interest rates had peaked and central banks would soon start cutting rates.\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was 0.145% lower at 103.30, after clocking its weakest monthly performance in a year in November, despite a 0.6% jump overnight.\nData on Thursday showed U.S. consumer spending rose moderately in October, while the annual increase in inflation was the smallest in more than 2-1/2 years.\nThe eagerly awaited personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 3% in October from a year ago, moderating from a three-month string of 3.4% readings though still above the Fed's 2% target.\n\"While the 3% level remains too high to declare victory on inflation, it marks a new low for the series that will likely please the Fed and alleviate any pressure to implement further hikes,\" said Ryan Brandham, head of global capital markets, North America, at Validus Risk Management.\n\"It remains to be seen if getting from 3% to 2% will be easy, or if inflation will remain sticky in 2024.\"\nFederal Reserve policymakers signalled on Thursday that the U.S. central bank's interest rate hikes are likely over, but left the door open to further monetary policy tightening should progress on inflation stall.\nMarkets are pricing in a 97% chance of the Fed standing pat in its December meeting, the CME FedWatch tool showed, with a 42% chance of a rate cut in March next year compared with a 27% chance last week.\nInvestor focus will now move to comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell later on Friday, with traders likely to scrutinize every word to sketch out rate outlook.\n\"We expect Powell to reiterate the possibility of further tightening and dampen expectations of rate cuts, said Carol Kong, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\"Further loosening of financial conditions may undermine the FOMC\u2019s efforts to tame inflation pressures. That said, we do not expect the FOMC to tighten policy again.\"\nOver in Europe, data on Thursday showed Euro zone inflation tumbled more than expected for a third straight month in November, fuelling bets of early spring rate cuts despite the European Central Bank's explicit guidance.\nThe euro was up 0.13% at $1.0902, having slipped 0.7% on Thursday after the inflation data. The single currency is down 0.3% for the week. Sterling was last at $1.2643, up 0.17% on the day.\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.31% to 147.73 per dollar, on course for its third straight week of gains against the dollar, pulling it away from the near 33-year low of 151.92 it touched in the middle of November.\nFormer top Japanese finance ministry bureaucrat and senior central banker Toshiro Muto said on Thursday that chances were high for the Bank of Japan to scrap both negative interest rates and yield control as early as April when annual wage talks confirm the scope of pay hikes.\nThe Australian dollar rose 0.20% to $0.662, while the New Zealand dollar rose 0.37% to $0.618.\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore.

        "text": "\nBy David Gaffen\n(Reuters) - A broad swath of global industrial and consumer bellwethers reported stronger-than-expected earnings in their most recent quarter, as resilient spending patterns kept profits afloat despite high interest rates.\nGiants like Coca-Cola, General Electric and Novartis exceeded expectations on Tuesday as reporting season picked up steam, with major technology companies on deck to report in coming days. Broadly, companies say demand has held up, belying long-held expectations for a recession that has yet to materialize.\nThrough Tuesday morning, 81% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported results have beat expectations, compared with an average of 67% since 1994. About one-quarter of S&P companies have released results and are surpassing analysts' forecasts by more than 7%, far above the historic average, according to LSEG I/B/E/S data.\nBoth Coca-Cola and industrial conglomerate 3M raised their full-year outlooks. Telecom company Verizon said it brought in more subscribers than expected as it also raised its forecast for free cash flow.\nIn Europe, Swiss companies Novartis and Logitech International both raised their full-year earnings forecast after reporting strong results. Luxury apparel maker Hermes said sales were up briskly in the third quarter.\nEuropean earnings reports are not as far along as in the U.S. So far, 50 companies in the EuroStoxx 600 have posted results, with 54% ahead of estimates, in line with the typical average, according to LSEG I/B/E/S.\nU.S. automaker General Motors reported a 5.4% increase in revenue and said its average vehicle selling price was $50,750 in the most recent quarter, down slightly from the previous quarter.\n\"So far the consumer has held up remarkably well for us as evidenced by the average transaction prices,\" said Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer at GM. As for rising interest rates, he said \"it's something we're mindful of but not something we're seeing in the immediate market for our vehicles.\"\nIn recent days the U.S. Treasury benchmark 10-year note yield touched 5% for the first time in 16 years as the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised short-term borrowing rates to slow the economy and rein in inflation.\nLast week Elon Musk, CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla, noted the increase in borrowing costs, saying it would directly affect sales as people need credit to buy cars. GM's Jacobson said rates were a concern as well, but also said spending was holding up.\n3M CEO Michael Roman said back-to-school spending was less robust than in previous years. \"We're just looking at the uncertainty around what happens for the holiday season,\" he said, adding that the shift from discretionary spending into staples like food has continued.\nSo far the rise in interest rates has not hurt the labor market, where unemployment remains at a still-low 3.8%. Housing purchases, dependent on affordable mortgages, have slowed, and the equity market has been stagnant, having lost 6.5% in the last three months, with the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio dipping to 17.7, lower than the last few months.\n\"That 5% number on the 10-year is eye-catching, and that's why equities have stalled out here, but historically speaking 5% hasn't been horrible for valuation,\" said Robert Teeter, managing director of Silvercrest Asset Management, which has $31.9 billion under management.\n(Reporting by David Gaffen; Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "text": "\nBy Howard Schneider\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Federal Reserve officials agreed at their last policy meeting that they would proceed \"carefully\" and only raise interest rates if progress in controlling inflation faltered, the minutes of the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 gathering showed on Tuesday.\n\"All participants agreed that the Committee was in a position to proceed carefully,\" according to the minutes, which appeared to show support for more rate hikes dissipating within the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, and the baseline shifting to one in which its benchmark overnight interest rate remains steady absent a bad inflation surprise.\nInflation has been slowing - consumer prices did not rise at all on a month-to-month basis in October - and while the Fed has not declared its fight against rapid price increases over, the tenor of the discussion has been shifting towards a focus on how long to keep the policy rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range.\n\"Participants noted that further tightening of monetary policy would be appropriate if incoming information indicated that progress toward the Committee's inflation objective was insufficient,\" said the minutes, a statement that indicated it will take an unexpected shock of some degree to prompt a further rate increase.\nThat sentence did not appear in the minutes of the Fed's prior meeting in September, when \"a majority of participants\" still judged that another rate increase would be needed in a tightening cycle that has pushed the policy rate 5.25 percentage points higher in the past 20 months.\nThe latest policy meeting readout, by contrast, said that \"all participants judged it appropriate to maintain\" the current rate setting, a stance that will be clarified at the Fed's Dec. 12-13 meeting when policymakers issue a new set of detailed projections for interest rates and the economy.\nThe document drew little reaction in financial markets, largely affirming the view that the Fed is done raising rates but won't explicitly say so until more officials become convinced inflation won't rebound.\nContracts tied to the federal funds rate continued to show a near-zero probability of further increases. Odds of a rate cut at the Fed's April 30-May 1, 2024 meeting rose slightly to roughly 60%, from about 57% before the release of the minutes, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\nU.S. stocks added slightly to losses and closed lower following the release of the minutes, while the U.S. dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields slipped.\nThe minutes showed U.S. central bank policymakers wrestling with conflicting economic signals that have made risks to the economy \"more two-sided,\" with rekindled inflation still a concern, but worries as well about clamping down on credit too far and damaging the economy's prospects.\nU.S. economic growth had just registered an outsized 4.9% annualized gain in the third quarter, a seemingly inflationary pace. But financial markets had driven interest rates higher for households, businesses and the U.S. government, threatening to curb economic and job growth more than might be necessary to return inflation to the Fed's 2% target.\n\"Participants commented on the significant tightening in financial conditions in recent months, driven by higher longer-term yields,\" the minutes said.\nStill, inflation \"remained well above\" the central bank's target, likely requiring Fed policy \"to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation is clearly moving down sustainably.\"\n\"The overall tone of the FOMC minutes was cautiously hawkish - the commitment to remaining in restrictive territory for 'some time' was the clearest takeaway,\" said Ian Lyngen, strategist with BMO Capital Markets.\nNO VICTORY DECLARATION\nFed Chair Jerome Powell had made liberal use of the \"careful\" concept at his last press conference in describing the central bank's efforts to balance still-elevated inflation with a sense the economy was about to slow.\nThere's good reason to be cautious, with the Fed possibly on the verge of pulling off the unexpected by navigating out of the worst inflationary surge in 40 years without doing major damage to the economy.\nA New York Fed staff study released on Tuesday suggested in fact that the U.S. central bank's late start in raising interest rates, with the first hike coming a year after prices began a sharp rise, allowed the economy to bank more growth with the same progress on lowering inflation than would have been the case if rate increases had started sooner.\nThere's little appetite among policymakers, however, to declare victory yet, or to give investors much direct guidance about what will happen next.\n\"Inflation has given us a few head fakes. If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so,\" Powell said at an International Monetary Fund research conference earlier this month. \"We will continue to move carefully, however, allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of over-tightening.\"\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Additional reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir and Michael S.

One way is to use public companies to incur debt,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe better approach would be to try and set up a new fund and anchor it in the constitution.\u201d\nThat would require Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s coalition to find support from opposition lawmakers \u2014 as it did when setting up a fund for the country\u2019s military after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Fuest said that may not be possible in the short term, \u201cbut maybe after negotiations.\u201d\nThe government will suspend the constitutional borrowing limit for this year after the court ruling forced Finance Minister Christian Lindner to retroactively account for at least \u20ac37 billion ($40.4 billion) of debt earmarked to ease the burden of high electricity and gas prices on households and companies.\nThe Nov. 15 judgment in Karlsruhe against a climate transition facility has called into question hundreds of billions of euros of financing in the government\u2019s special funds \u2014 some of them decades old \u2014 that are not part of the regular federal budget.\nBloomberg Economics estimates that the situation could reduce economic growth by 0.5% next year as it casts doubt over several large investment projects.\nFor Fuest, the worst-case scenario would materialize if the budget hole is \u201cfilled by spending cuts and tax increases,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would have a very negative impact on growth. It could put Germany back into recession in the coming year.\u201d\n\u201cMy main scenario would be that the government manages to find other solutions so that yes, there is uncertainty which will dampen growth a little bit,\u201d according to Fuest. \u201cI think we will see growth, albeit rather weak growth \u2014 something between maybe a half percent and 1%.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

With 40% of mortgage holders already seeing their shorter-duration mortgages renew at higher interest rates, Rogers said officials are watching how households adjust.\n\u201cBy the end of 2026, virtually all remaining mortgage holders will go through a renewal cycle and, depending on the path for interest rates, may face significantly higher payments.\u201d\nRead More: Bank of Canada\u2019s Rogers Urges Shift by Banks on Mortgage Lending\nIn the next two years 45% of all outstanding mortgages may be forced to contend with higher rates as they renew or reset, according to a report released Thursday by the Canada Mortgage & Housing Corporation. If rates remain at current levels, borrowers will be collectively on the hook for C$15 billion ($10.9 billion) in extra interest payments each year.\nRogers said banks and financial institutions are keeping bigger capital and liquidity buffers, and are putting more cash aside as a \u201cproactive adjustment\u201d to contend with possible credit losses.\nWhile Rogers made clear her comments weren\u2019t meant to be predictive in terms of the path for the Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight rate, the speech also adds to evidence policymakers increasingly see borrowing costs as less restrictive. The bank held its key rate at 5% for the second straight meeting in October, citing mounting evidence of a slowing economy despite increased inflation risks.\nSpeaking to lawmakers last week, Governor Tiff Macklem said the neutral rate \u2014 the theoretical level of interest rates that is neither restrictive nor stimulative \u2014 was probably drifting higher, and he admitted he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the bank\u2019s decision to leave the range for the neutral rate between 2% and 3% in their annual review earlier this year.\nFormer Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told BNN Bloomberg Television that while borrowing costs are likely to normalize lower, it doesn\u2019t mean interest rates will go back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still going to require a major rethink of how much debt you can carry, whether you\u2019re a company or whether you\u2019re a household,\u201d Poloz said.\n--With assistance from Ari Altstedter and Sandra Mergulhao.\n(Adds details from CMHC report and Poloz interview starting in paragraph nine.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Provisions for losses on impaired loans climbed C$259 million. CIBC\u2019s earnings have previously been dented by a surge in impairments in the bank\u2019s US office loan portfolio.\nCIBC\u2019s stock performance tends to be closely correlated to the broader outlook for the Canadian housing market, according to analysts.

Stocks jump, bond yields fall, and a dash ensues among equity speculators into shady corners encompassing everything from meme fliers to crypto and profitless tech.\nThat\u2019s November in a nutshell. Volatility has fallen to pre-pandemic lows and a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gauge of global risk appetite has hit near the highest level in two years. Yet events in June and July \u2014 marked by another all-encompassing rally that gave way to a 10% correction \u2014 provide sinister parallels.\nCould this time be different? Perhaps. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushed back Friday on the prospects for interest-rate cuts, the central bank\u2019s historic tightening campaign is seen as game over across markets. At the same time, the risk-on exuberance is working against Powell\u2019s goal of tightening financial conditions, a back-and-forth dynamic that has contributed to the demise of past rallies.\n\u201cThe shifting narratives have been swinging markets far more than is warranted by fundamentals \u2014 in both directions,\u201d Dan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant shifting back and forth between oversold and overbought conditions.\u201d\nAs always, extreme moves in markets are eliciting warnings about their sustainability. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said in an episode of The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations that economic optimism may be misplaced \u2014 unless the Fed starts easing a lot sooner than many investors expect. He cited the impact of so-called real rates, noting that as inflation recedes they effectively rise and threaten the business cycle.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a real risk of a hard landing if the Fed doesn\u2019t start cutting rates pretty soon,\u201d said Ackman, noting that he\u2019s seen evidence of a weakening economy.\nBy almost any measure, November\u2019s advance was a huge one. Plunging Treasury yields set the stage for powerful rallies in stocks, credit and emerging markets. The Bloomberg 60/40 index saw one of its best months on record. Indexes tracking crypto, meme stocks, initial public offerings and unprofitable tech \u2014 all of which struggled when yields were soaring \u2014 surged big time. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARKK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) gained a record 31%, its best month on record.\n\u201cOptimism that the Fed\u2019s next move is going to be a rate cut, optimism that the US economy is going to avoid a hard landing \u2014 they\u2019re strong drivers, and it has been a tremendous pivot,\u201d Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, said by phone. \u201cCould we see a hangover in January? Potentially, if the Fed does stick to the higher-for-longer narrative.\u201d\nThe forceful rally comes at a delicate time. While a parade of data this week fortified bulls \u2014 from jobless claims to gross domestic product and consumer confidence \u2014 it remains unclear whether the retreat in inflation portends a more lasting economic slowdown. On Friday, the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index come in below expectations, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow index saw its estimate for US fourth-quarter growth ease to 1.19%.\nAlong with all the economic uncertainty investors are also contending with dicey market dynamics that were also present over the summer, namely the outsize role of seven tech superstocks in propelling the lion\u2019s share of the wins. Even with a slight broadening in November, the top five contributors account for 68% of the index\u2019s gain this year, and the top 10 make up 90% of the return.\nSuch narrow leadership is typical before a slowdown, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., which says equity concentration has reached levels not seen since 1970s.\n\u201cEquities are now richly valued with volatility near the historical low, while geopolitical and political risks remain elevated. We expect lackluster global earnings growth with downside for equities from current levels,\u201d wrote JPMorgan strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas.\n--With assistance from Emily Graffeo.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAnduril Builds a Tiny, Reusable Fighter Jet That Blows Up Drones\nB-School Admissions Deans Are Feeling The Pressure From Falling Applications\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

        "text": "\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 More than 120 suspected victims of job scams have been rescued after being stranded by fighting in northern Myanmar between the military and armed ethnic groups, Malaysia's government said.\nThe number of Malaysians rescued surged from an initial 26 to 127 in the past few days, Foreign Minister Zambry Abd Kadir told local media late Monday before flying to New York.\nHe said they are in a safe location and the government hoped to fly them home by Thursday. The foreign ministry earlier said the group were stranded in Laukkaing, a town known as a notorious hub for online scams, gambling and other major organized crimes.\nFighting has continued in northern Myanmar after an alliance of armed ethnic minority groups launched a surprise offensive last month. They have seized control of several border crossings to China, in a major disruption to trade.\nZambry said the ministry was asked to help evacuate an Indonesian and a Hong Kong citizen from the area. He said the duo will be flown out with the Malaysians. He thanked China and Myanmar authorities for their help in the operation but didn't give further details.\nA government official who declined to be named as he isn't authorized to speak to the media said Tuesday that based on initial information, the 127 Malaysians were lured to the area by fraud job offers. He said details of the rescue operation and their evacuation couldn't be released yet due to the sensitivity of the case and the various parties involved.\nEarlier this month, 266 Thai victims of human traffickers, several Filipinos and a Singaporean were also rescued from Laukkaing and taken to China's Kunming city, where they boarded chartered flights to Bangkok. Another group of 41 Thais were also reportedly repatriated across the land border.\nUnrest in Myanmar\u2019s border region has been a constant irritant to China, despite its support for the country's military rulers who took power in a takeover in 2021.\nBeijing earlier this week called for a cease-fire in Myanmar but said it will continue live-firing drills on its side of the frontier to prepare for any emergency. Chinese police have reportedly fired tear gas to drive away people who were sheltering close to the border fence.\nChina is highly wary of conflicts spilling over the border that is already rife with drug trafficking and people smuggling. Cybercrime targeting Chinese victims has become a major concern, and China has pushed hard to eliminate the groups based in Myanmar and other countries and to send the perpetrators back to China for prosecution.",

The six-point fall is the fourth-straight drop in builder confidence, leaving the index at its lowest since December 2022.\nConfidence could improve in coming months, however, as mortgage rates that peaked near 8% last month look poised to decline and credit conditions loosen across the economy.\n\"While builder sentiment was down again in November, recent macroeconomic data point to improving conditions for home construction in the coming months,\" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. \"In particular, the 10-year Treasury rate moved back to the 4.5% range for the first time since late September, which will help bring mortgage rates close to or below 7.5%. Given the lack of existing home inventory, somewhat lower mortgage rates will price-in housing demand and likely set the stage for improved builder views of market conditions in December.\"\nThe average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 7.61% last week after climbing to as high as 7.9% in October, the highest in more than two decades, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. A separate survey from Freddie Mac showed the average rate was down to 7.5% in the latest week.\nAs high rates cut into home affordability, homebuilders have slashed prices in an effort to attract buyers.\nHomebuilder confidence rose during the first-half of the year as high mortgage rates and limited inventory of existing homes drew prospective homeowners to the new construction market. NAHB's buyer traffic index reached its peak in July at 40 and fell to 21 in November, the lowest since December 2022.\nAmid weakening traffic, 36% of builders cut home prices in November, the highest share since November 2022.

        "text": "\nLegendary investor and polymath Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman and Warren Buffett's right-hand man and friend of nearly six decades, died on Tuesday in California, the company announced. He was 99.\nTogether, Buffett and Munger built Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) into one of the most successful and long-lasting business partnerships that enthralled millions worldwide.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Buffett said, \"Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation.\"\nBerkshire, originally a textile manufacturer, has grown into a multinational conglomerate that wholly owns popular brands like Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom and has stakes in Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO), and other large public companies.\nEvery year, thousands of Berkshire shareholders make the pilgrimage to Omaha, Neb., to listen to Buffett and Munger answer their questions for hours. Munger, known for his maxims about business, investing, and life, would sip Coca-Colas and nibble See's Candies peanut brittle alongside his partner.\nFamously, he would often say, after Buffett finished speaking, \"I have nothing further to add.\"\nCharles Thomas Munger was born on Jan. 1, 1924, in Omaha, Neb. He grew up in the Dundee neighborhood, a half a block from Buffett\u2019s house, and attended the same high school as the investing legend. He even worked at Buffett\u2019s grandfather\u2019s grocery store as a teenager, though the pair wouldn\u2019t meet until later at the ages of 35 and 29, respectively. When they did finally meet, they became instant friends and partners.\nAt the age of 17, Munger enrolled in the University of Michigan to study mathematics only to drop out at the age of 19 during World War II to serve in the US Army Air Corps. While in the Army, he studied meteorology at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif., which became his home.\nAfter the Army, Munger chose to study law, a \"natural course of activity\" for him given that his father was an attorney and his grandfather was a federal judge.\nWhen Munger applied to Harvard Law School he was initially rejected. He applied again and received his J.D. from Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1948. After law school, Munger returned to Los Angeles where he practiced real estate law.\nAfter his father died in 1959, Munger returned to Omaha to sort out his affairs. While there, Munger ate lunch at the Omaha Club with friends who invited Buffett along. The lunch sparked an instant friendship and one of the most important business partnerships ever forged.\nIn 1962, Munger started an investment partnership. He also started a law firm, Munger Tolles, but stopped practicing law a few years later to focus on investing.\nBuffett credited Munger for breaking his \"cigar-butt\" investing habit, a strategy the investor learned from Benjamin Graham of finding companies at bargain prices and getting \"free puffs\" out of them.\nWhile that strategy worked well in Buffett\u2019s early days of managing much smaller sums of money, Munger \"set the course for building a business that would combine huge satisfactory profits,\" according to an account of Berkshire\u2019s history written by Buffett himself.\n\u201c[Charlie\u2019s] most important architectural feat was the design of today\u2019s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices,\u201d Buffett wrote.\nBuffett also learned the importance of knowing one\u2019s circle of competence from Munger.\n\"Ben Graham taught me a way to value certain type of business, but the selection of variable companies dried up. Charlie taught me about durable competitive advantage \u2014 not how big circle of competence is, but knowing where the edges are most important,\" Buffett said at the 2010 annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting.\nMunger often spoke of the importance of understanding \"the edge\" of one's competence \u2014 in other words, knowing what you don\u2019t know.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a hugely important thing, knowing the edge. It\u2019s hardly a competence if you don\u2019t know the edge of it. You know, if you have a misapprehension regarding your own competency that means you lack competence, you\u2019re going to make terrible mistakes. I think you\u2019ve got to constantly measure what you achieve against other people of achievement, and you have to keep being determinedly rational, and avoiding a lot of self-delusion,\u201d Munger said at the 2019 Daily Journal meeting.\nIn a 1985 shareholder letter, Buffett said Munger \u201chas always emphasized the study of mistakes rather than successes, both in business and other aspects of life.\u201d\nMunger \u201cdoes so in the spirit of the man who said: \u2018All I want to know is where I\u2019m going to die so I\u2019ll never go there.\u2019 You\u2019ll immediately see why we make a good team: Charlie likes to study errors and I have generated ample material for him, particularly in our textile insurance businesses,\u201d Buffett wrote.\nTo make better decisions in business and life, Munger often deployed what he called a \u201clatticework\u201d of mental models.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have models in your head. And you\u2019ve got to array your experience \u2014 both vicarious and direct \u2014 on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You\u2019ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head,\u201d Munger said during a 1994 speech at USC\u2019s business school.\nOne of those famed mental models is a phenomenon Munger coined the \"lollapalooza effect\" in a 1995 speech. At the 2018 Daily Journal meeting, Munger said he came up with the term after reading the main textbooks in introductory psychology and \u201cof course, being Charlie Munger, I decided the psychologists were doing it all wrong and I could do it better.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the ideas I came up with, which wasn\u2019t in any of the books, was that the 'lollapalooza effects' came when three or four of these tendencies were operating at once in the same situation. I can see that it wasn\u2019t linear,\u201d Munger said.\nMunger was also passionate about architecture, a field in which he had no formal training. He developed luxury beachfront homes in Montecito, Calif., nicknamed \"Mungerville.\" He also designed college dormitories and his own home.\n\"I think a life properly lived is just learn, learn, learn all the time. I think Berkshire has gained enormously from these investment decisions by learning for a long period,\" Munger said at Berkshire's 2017 annual meeting.\nBeyond the investment success, Buffett has repeatedly said that Munger made him \u201ca better person.\u201d\n\u201cPeople find this hard to believe, but in 60 years, we\u2019ve never had an argument. We have disagreed about things and we\u2019ll probably keep occasionally disagreeing about this or that, but if you define an argument where emotion starts entering into it or anger or anything of the sort it just doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t happen,\" Buffett said at the 2019 annual meeting.\nMunger encountered his fair share of hardship in life. His first marriage to Nancy Huggins ended in divorce. A year later, his 8-year-old son died of leukemia. Munger also lost his eye after a botched cataract surgery.\nMunger\u2019s second marriage to Nancy Barry lasted 54 years until his wife\u2019s death in 2010. When asked about relationship advice and finding a good spouse, Munger said, \u201cThe best single way is to deserve a good spouse.\u201d\nMunger often said the secret to a long and happy life is \"simple.\"\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of envy, you don\u2019t have a lot of resentment, you don\u2019t overspend your income. You stay cheerful in spite of your troubles. You deal with reliable people, and you do what you\u2019re supposed to. All these simple rules work so well to make your life better, and they\u2019re so trite.\u201d\nJulia La Roche was formerly a Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.\nRead more insights from longtime Berkshire Hathaway chairman Charlie Munger:\nCharlie Munger on AI: 'I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well'\nBillionaire Charlie Munger on Costco stock: 'I'm a total addict'\nCharlie Munger: 'I'm not proud of my country' for allowing 'crypto sh-t'\nCharlie Munger on Robinhood stock crash: 'God is getting just'\nMunger on market swings: 'As Kipling said, treat those two imposters just the same'\nCharlie Munger on journalism: 'We have suffered a huge loss here'\nCharlie Munger on Activision Blizzard: 'I like Bobby Kotick a lot'\nApple is 'ungodly well-managed,' Berkshire's Charlie Munger says\nMeme stock trading is \u2018like a drunken brawl': Charlie Munger\n'The first rule of a happy life,\u2019 according to 97-year-old Charlie Munger\nCharlie Munger explains the best career strategy 'for the great mass of humanity'\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

The rest will come from investors, bank loans and government subsidies, they said.\nThe foundry, to be built in Miyagi prefecture, will begin with mature 40nm and 55nm semiconductors, focus on automotive chips and power controllers and will go online in 2027, the companies said. Japan, home to Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., is a heavy user of such chips, produced by the likes of Tokyo-based Renesas Electronics Corp.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made preparations to create an unbeatable foundry and build a semiconductor ecosystem,\u201d SBI Chief Executive Officer Yoshitaka Kitao said at a news conference Tuesday. SBI will pay for around \u00a5100 billion of the initial investment and seek another \u00a5100 billion through a new fund it plans to set up, but will not build a foundry without subsidies, he added.\nSBI shares rose 2.7%, while Powerchip shares fell 0.2%.\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s administration is paying billions of dollars in subsidies to chipmakers moving production to Japan. Spurred by the financial support, Powerchip\u2019s bigger rival and industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is building a factory in southern Japan, to go online next year.\nUS memory maker Micron Technology Inc. and domestic players Kioxia Holdings Corp. and Rapidus Corp. are also expanding production in the world\u2019s third-largest economy, helped by government support.\n\u201cThe automotive chips that Powerchip will focus on are precisely the kind of chips used in vehicles today and will help secure this production base,\u201d Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said at a regular press conference ahead of the investment announcement. \u201cWe want to secure the supplementary budget necessary to strengthen our semiconductor supply chain.\u201d\nJapan, which wants to claw back its former leadership in chips, is benefiting from a shift in global supply chains as manufacturers seek to lower reliance on Taiwan and hedge against rising US-China tensions. The US is also offering incentives to chipmakers building American capacity, but progress has been slow.\nJapan is \u201cthe best place\u201d for semiconductor investment, Powerchip Chairman Frank Huang said.\nWith so much capacity coming online in Japan, it remains unclear how companies will be able to secure enough engineering talent, given a weak yen.\nPowerchip\u2019s move comes as the chip sector fights to regain its footing from a sharp post-pandemic drop in demand.

For now, users must join a waitlist to get switched on, but the service aims to be immediately available starting in 2024.\nAt a time when retail investors\u2019 enthusiasm for stocks has cooled, Vlad Tenev, Robinhood\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, says he wants to shake up the UK market.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to help lower fees for all customers in the UK, just like we did in the US back in 2019, right before Covid,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg News.\nHe\u2019s offering 5% interest on uninvested cash, trading outside of market hours, as well as zero trading commission or currency fees to local users with as little as $1 to invest.\nWith its sleek, game-like app, Robinhood\u2019s rising popularity with first-time investors helped drive established US brokerages to slash their commissions for online trades to zero.\nBut as the company grew, it faced increasing scrutiny from regulators who\u2019ve accused it of enticing some customers to take on more risk that they could manage. During the pandemic, the company took a starring role in the subreddit-driven short squeeze on shares like GamesStop Corp, that ultimately left a raft of large US hedge funds bruised.\nRead More: Robinhood, Meme Stocks and Investing as a Game: QuickTake\nThe pioneer of commission-free trading apps has had the UK in its sights since 2019 \u2014 most recently via the now-scrapped acquisition of London-based crypto trading firm Ziglu.\nThe company will be joining an increasingly crowded market, competing with locals like Revolut and Freetrade as well as New York-based rival Public.com, which expanded to the UK in July.\nRead More: Robinhood Shares Fall on Revenue Miss as Crypto Volumes Tumble\nTenev said Robinhood\u2019s infrastructure and experience in the US give it an edge.\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve built this platform from the ground up and we\u2019re a technology company and financial services, not a brick and mortar institution, I think makes us more able to expand internationally in ways that traditional financial institutions can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nThe company also plans to start offering crypto trading in the European Union over the coming weeks.\nIn the US, Robinhood makes part of its revenue through payment for order flow, a controversial practice, which was banned in the UK, where market makers pay brokerages to route orders through them, rather than directly to stock exchanges.\n\u201cThe goal for the UK is to take advantage of all the other ways we have of generating revenue, sans payment for order flow,\u201d Tenev said. \u201cAnd because we\u2019re leveraging the same platform that we have in the US that we\u2019re building to be applicable globally, the incremental costs of servicing each new market should be low.\u201d\nRobinhood\u2019s transaction-based revenues fell 11% in the third quarter compared with the prior year to $185 million, largely due to lower crypto volumes, which tumbled 55% on the year. The company\u2019s shares are up about 10% this year, but still 90% lower than their peak.\nRobinhood has diversified its sources of revenue through various products such as securities lending and its premium paid account, Robinhood Gold, which offers additional features. Tenev said the firm was working on launching a credit card in the US.\nAs well as stocks, Robinhood offers its 23 million US customers trading in exchange-traded funds and cryptocurrencies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

It also comes with a $60-a-month subscription called Astro Secure, which Amazon says allows the robot to patrol areas on its own.\nSince Amazon first unveiled the Astro in 2021, the company has promised a Jetsons-like vision of robots handling household tasks. The $1,600 wheeled device sports a flat screen and periscope camera, and can respond to Alexa voice commands. But Amazon has been slow to ship the robot in large quantities, and it\u2019s remained a niche product that many consumers don\u2019t even know about.\nRead More: Amazon\u2019s Astro Home Robot Is Elusive Six Months After Debut\nWith the new version, Amazon may have a clearer application: helping businesses keep an eye on their premises. Though the robot\u2019s hardware is similar to the original model, it can patrol 5,000 square feet (465 square meters), up from 3,500 on the consumer version.\nThe offering is part of a growing range of Amazon security services, an area that\u2019s become a key focus since the company bought the Ring smart doorbell maker in 2018. Amazon is selling a $20-a-month Ring Protect Pro feature for storing security footage and a $99-per-month option that can call emergency services if an issue is detected.\nTaken together, the services will run about $180 a month \u2014 on top of an Astro price tag that will set businesses back thousands of dollars. That represents a particularly ambitious attempt by Amazon\u2019s hardware division to generate more recurring revenue.\nAmazon began testing some of the security services last year on the existing Astro. The increased mapping area required additional storage and memory capacity, necessitating the price increase, the Seattle-based company said. The robot\u2019s user experience also has been tailored to businesses.\nAmazon is seeking to recoup years of investment in Astro\u2019s development. Bloomberg first reported that the bot was in the works back in 2018, and the product was once pitched internally as a major initiative. But Amazon has become famous for killing off once-cherished projects, and Astro will likely need to become a steady seller or risk being discontinued.\nIt\u2019s been a tumultuous year for Amazon\u2019s devices business, and many top leaders who championed the Astro have left the company. Amazon recently hired Panos Panay, Microsoft Corp.\u2019s former chief product officer, as its new executive in charge of devices and Alexa.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High\nThe Impact and Cost of Musk\u2019s Endorsement of Antisemitism on X\nInflation Raging in Triple Digits Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nSHENGJIN, Albania (AP) \u2014 When the leaders of Albania and Italy announced a contentious agreement earlier this week to jointly process some asylum applications of migrants arriving by sea, some in the Western Balkans country saw it as reciprocation.\nItaly had welcomed thousands of Albanians fleeing poverty after the fall of communism more than three decades ago, and Albania's current government wanted to pay back the Italians' hospitality.\nOn Monday, Albania said it agreed to shelter thousands of migrants while Rome fast-tracks their requests seeking asylum in Italy, up to 36,000 a year. A memorandum between the countries says Italy would agree to remove migrants whose applications are rejected. The European Commission has requested more details.\nThe deal, which must be approved by Albania's parliament, already has been criticized by rights organizations and other groups, and it could backfire against Albania as it aspires to EU membership. Italy's left-wing opposition parties are protesting the deal.\nMeanwhile, ordinary Albanians are divided.\nBib Lazri, 66, a resident of the northern Albanian village of Gjader, where one of two accommodation centers is set to be built, said he welcomed the move given the historical ties between the two countries.\n\u201cAll my kids are abroad. They (the Italians) have welcomed us for 30 years now,\u201d Lazri said. \u201cIt is up to us to say a good word, to keep them and show our open heart.\u201d\nIn 1991, around 20,000 Albanians came on one dangerously overcrowded ship that reached the southeastern Italian region of Puglia. It was less than a year since political pluralism was announced in Albania, which for decades under communism had been closed to much of the world, and only months after the first democratic election.\nPoverty was widespread and basic goods, including bread, were in short supply. Albanians saw Italy as their \u201cWestern window.\u201d Many of the Albanians settled in Italy, obtained work and raised families.\nAlbanian Prime Minister Edi Rama announced the five-year deal on Monday in Rome standing beside Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni. Rama expressed gratitude on behalf of Albanians who found refuge in Italy, and \u201cescaped hell and imagined a better life.\u201d\nBut for many other Albanians, confusion and even anger is the main feeling for the surprise announcement.\nAlbania will offer two facilities, starting with the port of Shengjin, a main tourist spot about 75 kilometers (46 miles) south of the capital Tirana that has attracted almost 1 million tourists this year in the surrounding area.\nMany fear that the accommodation center will have a negative impact on the country. Albania has become a major tourism magnet this year, bringing more than 9 million tourists to its pristine coastline so far.\n\u201cA refugee camp at the port is not compatible with the government\u2019s idea of a European elite tourism,\u201d said Arilda Lleshi, a 27-year-old human rights activist, speaking from Tirana.\nMany people were upset by the fact that \u201csuch an agreement with wide social impact was done without a wide social consultation,\u201d Lleshi said. \u201cIt seems our prime minister continuously takes over to resolve the world\u2019s issues to get some credit internationally, without consulting with people beforehand.\u201d\nThose who will be deported will be sent to Gjader, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the Shengjin port, at a former military airport.\nItaly has committed to pay for the construction of two centers that can hold up to 3,000 migrants at a time.\nAlbania would also provide external security for the two centers, which would be under Italian jurisdiction. While the memorandum offers Albania broad security and financial reassurances, it fails to describe what migration procedures would be followed inside, experts noted.\n\u201cIt was not written by a migration expert,\u2019\u2019 said Hanne Bierens of the Migration Policy Institute Europe. \u201cWe have a lot of questions about how it would work.\u201d\u2019\u2019\nMigrants will be brought to Albania on Italian ships, and Italy agrees to remove any whose applications for international protection have been rejected, under the memorandum.\nHowever, it does not outline how they will be repatriated, which is often a long and difficult process. Nor does it say where migrants will be screened for transfer to Albania, whether at sea or on Italian soil.\nThe head of the port where the migrants will be processed, Sander Marashi, supports the government's agreement, saying that the facility won't be problematic for the port's normal operations.\n\u201cSuch an agreement shows that ... Albanians\u2019 hospitality is not only words but deeds too,\u201d Marashi said.\nBut some Albanians were surprised and not clear about what the agreement meant.\nAlbania has a recent history of welcoming refugees fleeing conflict and poverty, temporarily hosting around 4,000 Afghans in 2020. A small number of Afghans are still in Albania waiting to move to the United States or to other Western countries.\nRama also mentioned how Albanians welcomed ethnic Kosovo Albanians to escape massacres by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 1999. Albania also sheltered Jews and hid them from the Nazis during World War II.\nRequests by The Associated Press to interview government officials at the central and local level about the new deal with Italy were declined.\nThe agreement must be approved in parliament before it takes effect. Albania's political opposition has asked the prime minister to report to parliament before it is voted on. A vote hasn't been scheduled yet.\nRama's governing Socialists have 74 seats in the 140-seat parliament, so in theory, the government shouldn't have any issues in passing it. But the deal has created such consternation among some sectors of the population that passing it could become problematic.\nAlbert Rakipi of the Albanian Institute for International Studies considered the deal as \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201cdeceitful and unsustainable,\u201d and \u201cunreasonable.\u201d\n\u201cNone of the thousands of people risking their lives to reach Europe dream of a future in which they are placed in camps in a small and poor country just outside\" the borders of European Union countries, Rakipi said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Colleen Barry in Milan, Italy, contributed to this report.\nFollow Llazar Semini at https://twitter.com/lsemini\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

It said Micron was not paying its fair share to use the patented inventions.\n\"While we cannot discuss the specifics of pending litigation, I can confirm that YMTC recently filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Micron Technology, Inc for infringement of our company\u2019s patents related to the design, manufacture, and operation of 3D NAND technology,\" YMTC said in a statement to Reuters on Monday. \"We are confident that this matter will be resolved swiftly.\"\nMicron declined to comment on pending litigations.\nMicron makes DRAM chips and NAND flash memory chips and competes with South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as well as Japan's Kioxia, a unit of Toshiba. YMTC is a much smaller rival which was last year barred by the U.S. from buying certain American components.\nThe U.S. in recent years has increased restrictions on exporting chipmaking technology to China on security grounds.\nIn May, China said Micron products failed a network security review and barred purchase of them by operators of key infrastructure.\nMicron was embroiled in a dispute in 2018 involving Chinese state-backed chipmaker Fujian Jinhua which was accused of - and which denied - trade secret theft. Later that year, its main products were subject to a temporary sales ban in China.\nChina was once Micron's biggest market, generating half of its $20 billion revenue in fiscal 2017. That share shrank to 16% in 2022, a year in which it closed DRAM operations in Shanghai.\nMicron has said it remains committed to China.

It\u2019s also spurred major players like Citigroup Inc. to enter massive metal-financing trades: buying metal cheaply and selling it forward for profit.\nTo be sure, the switch to contango is partly driven by higher interest rates, which adds to the cost of borrowing the funds needed to buy and hold metal for longer periods. That pushes those selling futures to demand a higher premium for metal deliverable at a later date.\nIn copper \u2014 which is often bought as a proxy for growth \u2014 the discount for spot metal relative to three-month futures recently touched the lowest since 2009 as a percentage of the price. At a major industry event in Shanghai last week, sentiment for 2024 was mixed, with many market players expecting a growing surplus of refined metal even as output from mines is under pressure.\nStill, the metal has benefited in recent days from expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year, as well as robust demand from China\u2019s renewable industry. Stockpiles in Asia\u2019s largest economy have depleted to critically low levels this year, a sign of local market tightness that could pull copper onshore.\n\u201cContango is usually seen as a negative signal, as it indicates there is ample spot market supply around, and incentivizes putting the commodity into storage,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts including Amy Gower wrote in a note. But for copper \u201csince 2003, a strong contango has not been a negative signal for prices, likely as China has been there to absorb excess material.\u201d\nCopper futures on the LME fell 1.1% to $8,355 a ton by 2:55 p.m. in London. All major metals were lower. Aluminum slid 1.3% and zinc fell 1.9%.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

The order has not been previously reported.\nThe ruling is a setback for Tesla after the company won two product liability trials in California earlier this year over the Autopilot driver assistant system. A Tesla spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.\nThe Florida lawsuit arose out of a 2019 crash north of Miami in which owner Stephen Banner's Model 3 drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler big rig truck that had turned onto the road, shearing off the Tesla's roof and killing Banner. A trial set for October was delayed, and has not been rescheduled.\nBryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor, called the judge's summary of the evidence significant because it suggests \"alarming inconsistencies\" between what Tesla knew internally, and what it was saying in its marketing.\n\"This opinion opens the door for a public trial in which the judge seems inclined to admit a lot of testimony and other evidence that could be pretty awkward for Tesla and its CEO,\" Smith said. \"And now the result of that trial could be a verdict with punitive damages.\"\nThe Florida judge found evidence that Tesla \"engaged in a marketing strategy that painted the products as autonomous\" and that Musk's public statements about the technology \"had a significant effect on the belief about the capabilities of the products.\"\nScott also found that the plaintiff, Banner's wife, should be able to argue to jurors that Tesla's warnings in its manuals and \"clickwrap\" agreement were inadequate.\nThe judge said the accident is \"eerily similar\" to a 2016 fatal crash involving Joshua Brown in which the Autopilot system failed to detect crossing trucks, leading vehicles to go underneath a tractor trailer at high speeds.\n\"It would be reasonable to conclude that the Defendant Tesla through its CEO and engineers was acutely aware of the problem with the 'Autopilot' failing to detect cross traffic,\" the judge wrote.\nBanner's attorney, Lake \"Trey\" Lytal III, said they are \"extremely proud of this result based in the evidence of punitive conduct.\"\nThe judge also cited a 2016 video showing a Tesla vehicle driving without human intervention as a way to market Autopilot. The beginning of the video shows a disclaimer which says the person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. \"The car is driving itself,\" it said.\nThat video shows scenarios \"not dissimilar\" than what Banner encountered, the judge wrote.\n\"Absent from this video is any indication that the video is aspirational or that this technology doesn\u2019t currently exist in the market,\" he wrote.

Since that time, Disney's stock has hit multiyear lows while activist investor Nelson Peltz launched yet another fight against the media giant. This time, he's pushing for multiple board seats.\nOn top of that, the company's parks business is slowing, its linear TV division is declining, and its streaming business is not yet profitable. There have been more misses than hits at the box office as investors question whether or not Disney has lost its magic.\nDisney stock, which closed down about 3% on Tuesday, has risen about 6% since the start of the year \u2014 massively underperforming the S&P's (^GSPC) 18% gain over that same time period.\n\nStill, Iger said there are reasons to be optimistic about its future.\n\"We have real reason at Disney to be optimists, and it starts with the fact that we're Disney,\" he told employees. \"And Disney, as you know, is a brand unto itself, but it's also an umbrella company that houses many assets and many great brands. So, reason to be optimistic number one is that.\u201d\nIger said he will be assessing the longterm potential for all of Disney's assets, with a particular focus on future growth.\n\"As is the case with all of our businesses, which we must do in order to basically serve shareholders, is we look at the future of all of our business with an eye towards are these businesses going to grow?\" he said. \"Will they stay the same or will they possibly decrease in value? And if so, what should we do about it?\"\nEarlier this summer, he had said the company would take an \"expansive\" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling they could potentially be sold.\nBut management seemed to downplay those comments with Dana Walden, head of Disney's entertainment division, telling employees on Tuesday that TV content remains vital to Disney's streaming ambitions.\n\"What we've discovered is that our linear channels are very deeply embedded in our streaming strategy,\u201d Walden said. \u201cThey want to watch live shows, sports, live events \u2014 they want to watch them in time period, and the place you can do that, for the most part is on linear channels \u2026 The notion of a communal event still exists largely on linear.\"\nOverall, Bob Iger said Tuesday this past year has been spent \"fixing a lot of things\" but that the company has \"emerged from a period of a lot of fixing to one of building again.\"\n\"I can tell you building is a lot more fun than fixing,\" he quipped.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\n(Adds analyst view of the impact of rise in Treasury yields in 11th paragraph, adds inflation data and an analyst comment in final paragraphs.)\nBy Ann Saphir\nOct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials will likely leave their policy rate on hold at next week's meeting thanks in large part to a new dynamic unfolding before them: Other forces are finally doing the work for them.\nWhile the benchmark rate they set every six weeks or so has sat unchanged since July - a horizon that now looks to extend to December if not longer - rates on the open market that determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers have kept climbing and now look poised to finally slow what has been a surprisingly strong economy.\nIndeed fresh tidbits on the lending environment are likely to feature prominently in briefing materials ahead of the Federal Reserve's Oct 31-Nov. 1 rate-setting meeting.\nThe Fed's latest survey on banking conditions won't be published until the Monday after next week's meeting, but past practice suggests findings from its October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, or SLOOS, are in policymakers' hands this week.\nThe Fed began its rate-hike campaign against high inflation in March of 2022, taking the policy rate from near zero then to 5.25%-5.50% as of July of this year.\nData published from Fed surveys currently in the public domain shows banks have already tightened standards for all kinds of business and consumer loans, demand for most types of loans has weakened, and growth for all stripes of loans has slowed.\nBusinesses have become particularly uninterested in borrowing, banks reported in the Fed's July senior loan officers opinion survey. Those trends have so far done little to weigh down strong GDP growth and consumer spending that along with large job gains seem to suggest ongoing upward pressure on prices.\n\"We don't have a lot of data to really hang our hat on at this point,\" said BMO's Scott Anderson. But the impact of tighter credit is coming, he said, and \"we're pretty confident we'll see a slowdown.\" Fed policymakers seem to be largely on that same page, with several noting the rise in the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note - up about a full percentage point since the Fed's last rate hike, to 4.85% - will also cool the economy.\nAnalysts differ over how to interpret the recent tightening of financial conditions. Analysts at Deutsche Bank estimate the rise in longer-term yields equates to the impact of three quarter-point Fed rate hikes, giving the Fed less itself to do. Barclay's view, by contrast, is that the tightening is driven by expectations for further Fed action, and actually underscores the need for another rate hike.\nGREATER PESSIMISM\nOverall U.S. commercial bank credit shrank during the third quarter, the first year-over-year decline in more than a decade, weekly Fed data show.\nThe decline was largely driven by a drop in the value of Treasury bonds as yields soared. Mortgage-backed securities held broadly by banks also fell in value, as mortgage rates have risen, most recently to a 23-year high of 7.9%.\nAnd a yearlong decline in loan demand accelerated in the second half of September, according to a twice-quarterly Dallas Fed survey of Texas banking conditions that closely tracks the Fed's national survey.\nBanks have become more pessimistic about future business activity, that survey showed, leading them to forecast even weaker loan demand ahead.\nBanks responding to the Dallas Fed survey reported increased delinquency for all kinds of borrowers, but particularly for consumer loans. That could be a particularly telling turn of events, because other Fed data shows that even as U.S. banks have tightened credit card standards, credit card borrowing did not slow in the second quarter.\nHouseholds have spent down much of the savings they built up during the pandemic, and employment gains don't look sustainable, said Nationwide's Kathy Bostjancic.\nAll that may add to a picture that sets the stage for a weaker fourth quarter, and further slowing next year, more reason for the Fed to keep rates where they are and let tighter credit and financial conditions do their work.\n\"The key question is the degree growth cools in the coming quarters to further relieve inflation pressures in the services sector,\" Bostjancic said.\nA Commerce Department report on Friday showed consumer spending surged in September and inflation by the Fed's preferred gauge rose 3.4%, with underlying inflation pressures easing slightly to 3.7% from August's 3.8%.\n\"The spending, income and inflation largely came in line with our expectations, so we forecast that the Fed is done tightening for this cycle, but with growth remaining resilient and inflation elevated the Fed will be in no hurry to cut rates,\" Bostjancic wrote after the report. \"We look for the Fed to keep rates on hold through mid-year 2024.\"\n(Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Dan Burns and Chizu Nomiyama)",

But enthusiasm among corporate technology buyers for features like the ability to summarize heaps of email into a few bullet points or speedily complete lines of computer code helped the company's revenue rise 13% to $56.5 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. That compares with analysts' consensus estimate of $54.52 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\"The results indicated that artificial intelligence products are stimulating sales and already contributing to top and bottom-line growth,\" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.\nMicrosoft shares were up 3% in after-hours trading.\nIn the reported quarter, revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses its Azure cloud-computing platform where much of the AI work will take place, grew to $24.3 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $23.49 billion, LSEG data showed. Azure revenue rose 29%, higher than a 26.2% growth estimate from market research firm Visible Alpha.\nBrett Iversen, Microsoft's vice president for investor relations, said much of the quarterly sales growth came from customers rekindling their use of Microsoft's cloud in anticipation of using AI services.\n\"What AI is doing ... is opening up either new conversations or extending existing conversations or getting us back in touch with customers that we maybe weren't doing as much with,\" Iversen told Reuters.\nBy comparison, Google-parent Alphabet's cloud division missed estimates for third-quarter revenue on Tuesday as an uncertain economy and high interest rates led its customers to trim their budgets.\n\"While a single quarter doesn\u2019t a major trend make, this quarter\u2019s cloud results from Microsoft and Google suggest that Azure is gaining share against its competition,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. \"It could be that Microsoft\u2019s very strong messaging on their (AI) technology is getting companies to consider them in a more serious way.\"\nMicrosoft said fiscal first-quarter profit was $2.99 per share, above analyst estimates of $2.65 per share, according to LSEG data.\n\"There are some weaker areas; search advertising revenues, for one, is growing slower than most segments,\" said Jeremy Goldman of research firm Insider Intelligence.\nMicrosoft said search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased by 10%. It does not break out the revenue figure for these operations.\nMicrosoft is weaving AI into its own products, such as the $30-a-month \"Copilot\" for its Microsoft 365 service that can summarize a day's worth of emails into a quick update. While the tool is being shown only to a small number of pilot customers until it becomes available next month, it requires businesses to make a number of upgrades to their Microsoft-based systems in order to use Copilot.\nInvestors are also tracking how much Microsoft spends on the massive data centers to power AI software. Microsoft said on Tuesday that fiscal first-quarter capital expenditures were $11.2 billion, up from $10.7 billion in the previous quarter, which itself was the biggest spend since at least fiscal 2016. Microsoft executives say that figure is likely to grow each quarter this fiscal year, putting the company on track to spend more than $44 billion.\nSales of its Windows operating system and other products in the segment grew to $13.7 billion, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of $12.82 billion, according to data from LSEG.\nThe segment containing the LinkedIn social network and its office productivity software grew to $18.6 billion, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of $18.20 billion, according to LSEG data.\nFor its fiscal second quarter, Microsoft forecast an Azure growth rate of 26-27% in constant currency, above analyst estimates of 25.1% according to Visible Alpha.

        "text": "\nBy Valerie Volcovici\nNov 12 (Reuters) - As the world's nations enter another round of talks this week on creating a first-ever treaty to contain plastic pollution, officials are bracing for tough negotiations over whether to limit the amount of plastic being produced or just to focus on the management of waste.\nWorking with a document called a \"zero draft\" that lists possible policies and actions to consider, national delegates to the weeklong meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, will be debating which of those options to include in what eventually would become a legally binding treaty by the end of 2024, officials involved in the negotiations said.\n\"We are at a pivotal moment in this process,\" said David Azoulay, a managing attorney of the Center for International Environmental Law who is an observer to the negotiations.\nThe world is currently producing about 400 million tonnes of plastic waste every year, with less than 10% of it being recycled, according to the UN Environment Programme, choking landfills and despoiling oceans. That produced amount is set to surge in the coming decade, as oil companies, which often also produce plastics, look to new sources of revenue amid the energy transition away from fossil fuels.\nToday, about 98% of single-use plastic - like bottles or packaging -is derived from fossil fuel, according to the U.N. Environment Programme.\nThe European Union and dozens of countries, including Japan, Canada and Kenya have called for -a strong treaty with \"binding provisions\" for reducing the production and use of virgin plastic polymers derived from petrochemicals and for eliminating or restricting problematic plastics, such as PVC and others containing toxic ingredients.\nThat position is opposed by the plastic industry and by oil and petrochemical exporters like Saudi Arabia, who want to see plastic use continue. They argue that the treaty should focus on recycling and reusing plastics, sometimes referred to in the talks as \"circularity\" in the plastics supply.\nIn a submission ahead of this week's negotiations, Saudi Arabia said the root cause of plastic pollution was \"inefficient management of waste.\"\nThe United States, which initially wanted a treaty comprised of national plans to control plastics, has revised its stance in recent months. It now argues that, while the treaty should still be based on national plans, those plans should reflect globally agreed goals to reduce plastic pollution that are \"meaningful and feasible,\" a U.S. State Department spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.\nThe International Council of Chemical Associations wants the treaty to include measures \"that accelerate a circular economy for plastics,\" according to council spokesperson Matthew Kastner.\n\"The plastics agreement should be focused on ending plastic pollution, not plastic production,\" Kastner told Reuters in a statement.\nFor oil, gas and petrochemical producers and exporters, a strong treaty is liability that could curb the sale of fossil fuels, said Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator of the International Pollutants Elimination Network.\nSaudi Arabia and other producers are \"pushing a 'bottom up' approach that makes individual countries responsible for the cleanup, health, and environmental costs of plastics and chemicals while leaving the fossil fuels and plastics industries off the hook,\" Beeler said.\nCountries will also be debating whether the treaty should set transparency standards for chemical use in plastics production.\nBut before they can work on the substantive points, delegates will need to resolve procedural objections that slowed the talks in June when Saudi Arabia said decisions should be adopted by a majority of countries rather than by consensus. A consensus would allow one country to block the treaty's adoption. Most other countries did not support the intervention.\nThe Saudi delegation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nEnvironmental groups said they hoped this week's talks can focus on the treaty's substance, and move beyond the procedural discussions that stall progress.\n\"We need a radical rethink of the global plastics economy and cannot get bogged down by derailing tactics and false solutions,\" said Christina Dixon of the Environmental Investigation Agency.

No cause was given. Munger would have turned 100 on Jan. 1.\n\"Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation,\" Buffett, Berkshire's 93-year-old chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.\nThe death of Munger, a Berkshire vice chairman since 1978, marks an end of an era in corporate America and investing.\nAlongside Buffett, Munger was respected and adored by investors around the world, many of whom flocked to Berkshire's annual shareholder weekends in Omaha, Nebraska, to hear the duo\u2019s folksy wisdom on investing and life.\nThough Munger was not involved in Berkshire's day-to-day operations, his death leaves Buffett without his longtime sounding board.\nInvestors also said that while Berkshire has installed managers it could trust to keep the company going, Munger's loss would be deeply felt, and it prompted an outpouring of sorrow.\n\"It's a shock,\" said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and longtime Berkshire shareholder. \"It will leave a big void for investors who have modeled their thoughts, words and activities around Munger and his insights.\"\nPHILOSOPHICALLY ALIKE\nSince becoming a Berkshire vice chairman, Munger worked closely with Buffett on allocating Berkshire's capital and not mincing words when he thought his business partner was making a mistake.\n\"He was certainly one of the greatest investors, as a team with Buffett,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey. \"I'm sure it is an enormous loss for Buffett personally.\"\nMunger was known for steering Buffett away from purchasing what Buffett called \"cigar butts\" \u2014 mediocre companies that had a puff of smoke left and could be bought for very cheap prices \u2014 and instead favoring quality.\n\"Charlie felt that buying very good businesses at fair prices that could keep compounding and reinvesting cash flow into continued growth was more consistent with how he and Warren were philosophically and liked to invest,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. \"They liked to own businesses forever.\"\nMoney manager Whitney Tilson, who knew Munger personally, said a \"generation of investment managers\" learned some of their craft from Munger and Buffett.\n\"What really glued us to these men was their advice on living a full life by instructing people how to think clearly, to be honest with oneself, to learn from mistakes and to avoid calamities,\" he said.\nTilson said he attended dozens of meetings the men ran and that Munger once quipped to a private audience: \"All I want to know is where I'm going to die so that I never go there.\"\nBERKSHIRE'S FUTURE\nBerkshire is unlikely to replace Munger and has not publicly discussed any need or desire to do so.\nTwo other vice chairmen, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, have day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance businesses, respectively.\nMunger's death comes one week after Buffett donated about $866 million of Berkshire stock to four family charities and issued a rare shareholder letter acknowledging that his own time was finite, in the twilight of his own storied investing career.\nIn last week's letter, Buffett said Berkshire was \"built to last\" and would remain in good hands without him.\nHe has never publicly signaled a desire to step down, including after a prostate cancer diagnosis in 2012.\n\"At 93, I feel good but fully realize I am playing in extra innings,\" Buffett wrote.\nUnder Berkshire's succession plan, which Munger inadvertently mentioned at Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting, Abel would become chief executive once Buffett is no longer in charge.\nBuffett's son Howard would become non-executive chairman, and one or two portfolio managers would take over investments.\nBerkshire's businesses include the BNSF railroad, car insurer Geico, and an array of energy, industrial and retail operations, as well as familiar consumer names such as Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies.\nIt also owns hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks, led by Apple.\nCHANGES WITHOUT CHARLIE\nPerhaps the most noticeable change to the public from Munger's death will be Berkshire's annual weekend, which draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha and is livestreamed worldwide.\nNo longer will Munger be there to share the stage with Buffett and answer dozens of shareholder questions over five hours.\nAbel and Jain, who have answered some of those questions in recent years, may play more of a role.\n\"The annual meeting will never be the same without Charlie's terse, open and honest comments,\" Lountzis said. \"He was so different from Warren, in the sense that Charlie said what he thought and didn't give a damn what anyone else thought.\"\nRusso added: \"Berkshire may be a little less fun without him.\"\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York;

The strikers include licensed vocational nurses, home health aides and ultrasound sonographers, as well as technicians in the radiology, X-ray, surgical, pharmacy and emergency departments.\nOakland, California-based Kaiser has hospitals and clinics that serve nearly 13 million Americans, and union members said understaffing is boosting the hospital system\u2019s profits but hurting patients.\nBoth sides said they prioritized patient health care during their talks.

        "text": "\nBy Jamie McGeever\nNov 30 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\nIf this week has so far been strangely listless for Asian markets, that could be about to change suddenly on Thursday as investors brace for a deluge of top-tier economic data and policy events from across the continent. Among the highlights, South Korea's central bank sets interest rates, China releases its official manufacturing and service sector purchasing managers index reports for November, and India announces its third quarter growth figures.\nThe latest industrial production and retail sales data from both Japan and South Korea are on tap too, all of which could move their respective markets, especially currencies.\nAll else equal, the risks for Asian markets on Thursday may be tilted to the upside, even though stock markets around the world again struggled on Wednesday. That's largely because the ongoing fall in the dollar and U.S. bond yields continues to loosen financial conditions. In theory, this should boost animal spirits and the allure of riskier, higher-yielding assets.\nU.S. financial conditions are the loosest since early September and have eased 100 basis points in a month, according to Goldman Sachs. The bank's global and emerging market indexes ticked up a bit last week, but financial conditions are also looser by around 100 bps from a month ago.\nU.S. rates futures markets are now pricing in more than 100 basis points of rate cuts next year starting in May, and the two-year Treasury yield is its lowest since July - it has slumped nearly 40 basis points this week alone.\nThe dollar on Wednesday hit its lowest since Aug. 10, and most Asian and regional currencies are taking advantage. Two of the best-performers are at the polar opposite ends of the 'carry' spectrum - the New Zealand dollar and Japanese yen. The 'kiwi' dollar got an extra boost on Wednesday following the central bank's 'hawkish hold' - policymakers kept the key cash rate at a relatively high 5.50%, but unexpectedly signaled that it could be raised again if inflation doesn't moderate.\nRemarkably, Japanese interest rates are still negative, but maybe not for much longer. Expectations the Bank of Japan will soon end its negative rate policy has pulled the yen up from the depths, and in the process, eased pressure on the central bank to support the currency via direct FX market intervention. South Korea's central bank is expected to keep its base rate on hold at 3.50% and leave it there until at least the middle of next year. But as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand showed on Wednesday, policymakers retain the ability to surprise.\nIndian GDP growth, meanwhile, is expected to have slowed to a 6.8% annual rate in the July-September period from 7.8%, while Chinese factor activity likely contracted again in November but at a slower pace.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:\n- South Korea interest rate decision\n- China official PMIs (November)\n- India GDP (Q3)\n(By Jamie McGeever Editing by Josie Kao)",

U.S. futures slipped and oil prices edged higher.\nChina reported that its consumer prices fell 0.2% from a year earlier in October while factory-gate prices declined 2.6%, suggesting demand remains slack as the economy struggles to recover from the economic disruptions of the pandemic.\nFalling prices have raised worries that China may fall into a bout of deflation, or chronically lower prices, but some analysts say much of the weakness recently is due to a decline in the cost of pork, a staple item for Chinese.\n\u201cWhat China has right now, is a low rate of underlying inflation, which reflects the fact that domestic demand is fairly weak,\u201d Robert Carnell of ING Economics said in a report. \u201cIf you want to use any term, \u2018disinflation\u2019 would be my preference, but what we are seeing today is mainly the result of a supply excess, rather than a collapse in demand,\u201d he said.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.3% to 17,513.81 and the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher, to 3,054.68.\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.5% to 32,643.60 after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told local reporters he had decided against calling an election before the end of the year.\nSouth Korea's Kospi added 0.5% to 2,432.43, while in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 7,009.60. In Bangkok, the SET lost 1.2%.\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 edged up 0.1%, to 4,382.78. Though the gain was slight, it was enough to extend the index's winning streak to eight days. That ties its longest such winning streak since a nine-day run 19 years ago.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1% to 34,112.27, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1% to 13,650.41.\nEli Lilly rose 3.2% after U.S. regulators said its popular diabetes treatment, Mounjaro, can be sold as a weight-loss drug and tap into a market with massive potential.\nAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were also toward the front of the market, each gaining more than 2% as oil prices continued to drop and ease the pressure on fuel costs.\nWarner Brothers Discovery tumbled 19% after reporting a worse loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also lost more streaming subscribers than forecast.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.49%, down from 4.57% late Tuesday, helping to impart calm across financial markets.\nA swift rise in the 10-year yield beginning in the summer dragged the S&P 500 down by more than 10% from its peak for the year. The 10-year yield briefly topped 5% to reach its highest level since 2007, as it tracked the Federal Reserve\u2019s main interest rate, which is above 5.25% and at its highest level since 2001.\nThe Fed has jacked up rates in hopes of slowing the economy and hurting investment prices enough to put downward pressure on inflation and get it back to its 2% goal.\nLast week, investors took comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell to indicate the central bank\u2019s hikes to interest rates may be done. A recent sharp drop in oil prices has relieved some inflationary pressure, raising the likelihood the Fed might hold rates steady instead of raising them further.\nThe price for a barrel of U.S. crude oil has fallen from above $90 to back to where it was in July, and it dropped another $2.04 to settle at $75.33 on Wednesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell $2.07 to $79.54.\nThe latest Israel-Hamas war has raised concerns about potential disruptions to supplies, causing prices to swing. But now the focus is on faltering demand given slowing growth in many economies, particularly in China.\nEarly Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude added 10 cents to $75.43 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 11 cents to $79.65 per barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar slipped to 150.94 Japanese yen from 150.98 yen.

Falling real wages in July adds to doubts over central bank projections that domestic demand can keep the country on a steady recovery path.\n($1 = 150.5100 yen) (Reporting by Leika Kihara and Yoshifumi Takemoto; Additional reporting by Takaya Yamaguchi; Editing by Kim Coghill and Jacqueline Wong)",

They first met at the G20 summit in Bali a year ago.\nAPEC leaders are due to gather from Nov. 15-17. From Nov. 11 senior finance officials and ministers will meet ahead of the summit, while the annual APEC CEO summit runs from Nov. 14-16.\nWHAT IS APEC?\nAPEC was founded in 1989 as an informal dialogue forum to promote regional economic integration. It initially had 12 members. Now it has expanded to involve more than 100 meetings a year.\nMembership covers 38% of the global population, or nearly 3 billion people, about 62% of GDP, and almost half of global trade.\nAPEC says it operates on the basis of non-binding commitments, open dialogue and equal respect for the views of all participants. Decisions are reached by consensus and commitments undertaken on a voluntary basis.\nAPEC'S MEMBERSHIP\nAPEC's members are: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.\nIt is unique in grouping economies rather than nations, allowing participation of Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, as well as self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as it own. It does not include India, however, the world's most populous country.\nAttempts by India to join APEC have been stymied for decades - first because its economy was not integrated into the global system and then by a membership freeze.\nTaiwan presidents do not attend APEC summits and Morris Chang, founder of semiconductor maker TSMC who went to the Bangkok summit last year, is to represent the island this year too.\nCURRENT CONTROVERSIES\nHong Kong's representation has become controversial. Washington, as host, is in charge of the guest list and in July U.S. congressional aides told Reuters Hong Kong's chief executive, John Lee, would not be invited as he is under U.S. human-rights sanctions.\nThe Hong Kong government said Lee would not attend due to \"scheduling issues\" and Financial Secretary Paul Chan would go to San Francisco instead.\nRussia's participation became divisive after it invaded Ukraine last year and its president, Vladimir Putin, did not attend the 2022 summit in Bangkok. The State Department has said Putin will not be in San Francisco.\nDrafting a final summit declaration will be difficult given divisions over conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nLast year leaders endorsed a text vowing to uphold and strengthen a rules-based multilateral trading system while noting \"most\" of them condemned Russia's war in Ukraine.\nMatt Goodman, a trade expert who was White House coordinator for the 2011 APEC summit, said smaller groups of like-minded states could issue their own statements.\n\"Given the make up of APEC with Russia and China both members, it's more difficult than ever to really come up with some tangible outcomes,\" he said.\nBUZZWORDS\nThe U.S. has chosen the theme \"Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All\" for APEC 2023. It says it aims for an \"interconnected, innovative, and inclusive\" region and \"to advance a free, fair, and open economic policy agenda that benefits U.S. workers, businesses, and families. \"\nAs of 2021, APEC members made up seven of the United States' top 10 overall trading partners.\nGoodman expects the U.S. to emphasize the relative strength of its economy in challenging times - a veiled comparison with difficulties China has faced after years of spectacular growth. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in San Francisco this week ahead of the APEC meetings.\nGoodman said Washington would seek to highlight progress in the 14-nation Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) it created to boost engagement after former President Donald Trump quit a regional trade pact in 2017. However, experts say it has so far failed to convince Asia that IPEF is more than a pale alternative to a fully fledged trade deal.\nFASHION SHOW\nTraditionally APEC leaders wear local costume for a final-day group photo. This started in 1993 when President Bill Clinton prescribed bomber jackets in Seattle.\nPresident Barack Obama, however, broke with tradition in 2011 by not ordering up the Hawaiian shirts that are de rigueur holiday attire on the islands. Whether and how San Francisco rises to the occasion remains to be seen.\n(Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington Additional reporting by Michael Martina in Washington Editing by Michelle Nichols and Matthew Lewis)",

        "text": "\n*\nU.N. accelerates withdrawal from Mali as fighting increases\n*\nKidal base left to rebels as peacekeepers move out\n*\nRestrictions by Mali junta jeopardising U.N. troops and kit\nBy Edward McAllister, David Lewis and Michelle Nichols\nDAKAR, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Before United Nations peacekeepers hurriedly abandoned their base in Kidal in northern Mali on Tuesday, they made a costly call: with insurgents stationed nearby, they destroyed sensitive equipment to avoid it falling into the wrong hands, the U.N. said.\nShortly after the last U.N. convoy rolled out, the ethnic Tuareg rebels announced they had taken over the base. Photos posted on social media on Wednesday appeared to show locals loading trucks with looted goods, including tyres, cables and chairs.\nMali's ruling military junta in June ordered the decade-old UN mission, known as MINUSMA, to leave as its relations soured with former international allies. MINUSMA has accelerated its departure in recent weeks as northern Mali has been engulfed in fighting between the rebels and government forces vying for control over areas it vacates.\nChaos has ensued.\nBloody confrontations have surrounded at least two U.N. bases, and two have also been looted, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the withdrawal. At least a dozen peacekeepers have been injured by explosive devices hit by U.N. convoys heading south, according to U.N. statements.\nThe U.N. has acknowledged difficulties with its departure. MINUSMA said in statements that it has been forced to destroy equipment including vehicles, ammunition and generators that its forces couldn't evacuate after the government imposed restrictions on moving them. Mission spokesperson Fatoumata Sinkoun Kaba told Reuters that millions of dollars of kit has been lost.\nAuthorities have denied approval for air support for convoys travelling over some of the most volatile terrain in West Africa. They ordered a halt to some imports of fuel and spare parts, and in some cases jeopardised the safety of departing peacekeepers, according to the two sources with direct knowledge of the withdrawal.\nMali's government did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\nSecurity analysts have warned that the Malian state could collapse altogether, further destabilising a region where insurgents with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State are gaining ground.\nMINUSMA had originally planned to leave Kidal in mid-November, the sources said. The equipment that was destroyed there and at two other northern bases could have been removed by U.N. trucks earlier, but Mali's junta blocked access, the U.N. said.\nFour aircraft have been grounded for lack of parts, the U.N. told Reuters, without specifying what kind of aircraft.\nDozens of U.N. import requests have gone unanswered, the U.N. Department of Peace Operations and the Department of Operational Support said in an internal letter to the Security Council on Oct. 14, seen by Reuters.\nWith routes to the south under threat from Islamist militants, the mission has explored the possibility of exiting through Algeria to the north or Mauritania to the west, the letter said, both of which were proving \"difficult to operationalise\".\nThe two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak on a sensitive topic, said they believe Mali's junta has sought to delay the retreat to give it time to reach the bases before the U.N. leaves.\nReuters was unable to confirm this but the junta has expressed concern in public pronouncements about the U.N. leaving bases before it arrives, including after the Kidal departure. Last month, it called the acceleration of MINUSMA's withdrawal a \"betrayal\".\n\"NASTY WAR\"\nThe situation marks a bitter end to the U.N.'s mission in Mali, where it deployed after the north was overrun by Islamist militants and Tuareg rebels in a 2012 uprising. MINUSMA initially helped restore some calm, but violence has persisted.\nThousands of civilians have died, and more than 170 peacekeepers have been killed in combat, making MINUSMA the U.N.'s deadliest mission.\nWorsening insecurity prompted military coups in 2020 and 2021. The junta then kicked out French troops who were helping fight the Islamists, teamed up with Russian private military contractor the Wagner Group, and ordered MINUSMA to leave.\nThe mission has until Dec. 31 to pack up. So far, more than 6,000 of nearly 14,000 personnel have left, the U.N. spokeswoman said.\nThe Tuareg rebels signed a 2015 peace agreement brokered by MINUSMA but maintained control of much of the north from Kidal. That accord has fallen apart since the mission began moving out.\nThe first sign of trouble came in early August, when fighting broke out between Mali's army and Tuareg rebels around the U.N.'s camp in Ber in the north. The mission left the camp on Aug. 13, two days early. Its convoy was attacked twice that day, injuring four peacekeepers, it said.\nIn October, gunfire around its base in Tessalit, near the Algerian border, forced peacekeepers to shelter in bunkers, the U.N. said. On Oct. 19, shots hit a MINUSMA plane landing at the airstrip.\nWhen the last troops left Tessalit on Oct. 21, they were denied air support for the nine-day journey across the unpoliced desert.\n\"They are effectively endangering the lives of our troops,\" one of the sources said. As in Kidal, peacekeepers destroyed equipment before leaving that could have been transported in trucks earlier, if the government had allowed.\nAir support was also denied convoys departing Kidal on a 350-kilometre (217-mile) journey south to the city of Gao, the MINUSMA spokesperson said.\nThree security analysts told Reuters that Kidal, a Tuareg stronghold from which rebels have long fought for autonomy of the desert region they call Azawad, was a potential flash point now that the U.N. has left. It is not clear how well positioned the Malian army is to take back the base. It has been trying to reach the city in recent weeks, but progress is slow, the analysts said.\n\"If the base in Kidal falls into the rebels' hands, this will cause an outcry in Bamako,\" said Yvan Guichaoua, senior lecturer at the University of Kent's Brussels School of International Studies. \"A nasty war may eventually erupt.\" (Reporting by Edward McAllister in Dakar, David Lewis in Nairobi and Michelle Nichols in New York.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Beijing earlier this month and met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, as Beijing seeks to boost ties with the Labour party ahead of a general election likely next year.\nWu will be joined by representatives from the Chinese foreign ministry, companies and academic bodies including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Alibaba and Tencent, according to one of the sources, who declined to be identified as the information remained confidential.\nAlibaba, Tencent and Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office did not respond immediately to requests for comment. China's science ministry and foreign ministry, as well as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, did not respond immediately to faxed requests for comment.\nWu was appointed to his role in the science ministry in December 2022. China is restructuring the ministry to channel more resources into achieving scientific breakthroughs, with a goal of moving faster towards self-reliance.\nThe other source said that President Xi Jinping had initially been invited, adding that there had been a big discussion over whether Britain should invite any Chinese officials. \"But eventually the view was taken that to not invite China would be counter-productive,\" the source said. They also declined to be named as the information was confidential.\nLike many countries around the world, China has been caught up in a global craze over generative AI following the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT last year.\nChina now has at least 130 large language models launched by companies including Alibaba and Tencent, accounting for 40% of the global total and just behind the United States' 50% share, according to brokerage CLSA.\n(Reporting by Laurie Chen in Beijing and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; editing by Miral Fahmy)",

The Fed very much wants to keep the door open for additional hikes in December or next year,\" said Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist, F.L Putnam Investment Management in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\nMichael Brown, market analyst at Trader X in London, said \"the 'higher for longer' policy stance remains in place.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 105.05 points, or 0.32%, to 33,157.92; the S&P 500 gained 21.24 points, or 0.51%, to 4,215.04; and the Nasdaq Composite added 95.61 points, or 0.74%, to 12,946.84.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.67% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.57%.

Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.5% to 151.06 yen.\nThe Japanese yen fell sharply on Tuesday, when the Bank of Japan tweaked its bond yield control policy, loosening its grip on long-term rates and pushing the currency to a one-year low against the dollar.\nThat was followed by a fresh and sterner warning from Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Wednesday that authorities stood ready to respond to recent \"one-sided, sharp\" moves in the currency.\nOil prices were last down after the Fed decision.

WHAT IS IT? Semaglutide, developed by Novo Nordisk over decades, is the active ingredient in type 2 diabetes treatments Ozempic and Rybelsus, as well as Wegovy, which is used for weight loss only. Ozempic and Wegovy are delivered by weekly injection; Rybelsus is a pill.\nKnown as a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, it mimics a hormone produced in the gut that helps regulate blood sugar and appetite. Semaglutide in injected form was first approved for use in the U.S. as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in 2017. It was approved there for weight control in 2021. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?\nMore than 650 million people globally were estimated by the World Health Organization to be obese in 2016, and about 480 million have type 2 diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Foundation.\nSupply of semaglutide is not keeping pace with demand.\nNovo, which produces the key ingredients for its treatments at its own factories in Denmark and in the United States, said on Nov. 2 that it expects \"continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications across a number of products and geographies.\"\nOn Nov. 10, the company announced it would spend $6 billion by end-2029 to expand its Kalundborg site in Denmark, mainly to boost output of active pharmaceutical ingredient including semaglutide. This year, it is spending just over $2 billion.\nThe investment will also expand its capacity to fill the pens used to inject the drugs - a process known as fill-finish, it said. It declined to give further details.\nBooming demand for both drugs has propelled Novo Nordisk to its highest-ever profits. In September, it became Europe's most valuable company. WHAT HAVE COUNTRIES DONE?\nBritain in July called for clinicians to only prescribe Ozempic and six other medicines from the GLP-1 class for their licensed uses, not for weight loss.\nBelgium issued a new law on Nov. 14, banning doctors from prescribing Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs for weight loss unless their patient's BMI is 35 or above and they have at least one underlying health condition. People taking part in clinical trials for drugs based on semaglutide may also continue to take it.\nThe curbs will be in force until August 2024, but may end sooner if supplies improve, a spokesperson for the health ministry said.\nGermany is considering banning Ozempic exports, saying the drug is being taken out of the country because it is cheaper there than elsewhere, and demand is driven by use for weight loss.

They also asked if the vehicles collect data on U.S. infrastructure during testing.\nThe letters said in the 12 months ended November 2022 that Chinese AV companies test drove more than 450,000 miles in California.\nIn July, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said his agency had national security concerns about Chinese autonomous vehicle companies in the United States.\n\"Whether we are talking about hardware or software, in the same way there are concerns around telecom or TikTok, there are concerns around transportation technologies,\" Buttigieg told Reuters.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Richard Chang)",

        "text": "\n(Updates prices throughout, adds quote in fifth paragraph)\nBy Rae Wee\nSINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The battered yen was stuck near a three-decade low against the dollar on Tuesday, struggling to find a floor as the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) ultra-easy monetary policy settings remained at odds with the prospect of higher-for-longer rates elsewhere.\nThe Japanese currency slumped to a 15-year low of 162.38 per euro in early Asia trade and slid to a roughly three-month trough of 186.25 per British pound.\nAgainst the dollar, the yen last stood at 151.72, languishing near a one-year low of 151.92 hit on Monday. A break below last year's trough of 151.94 per dollar would mark a fresh 33-year low for the yen.\nThe yen had jumped briefly against the greenback in New York hours on Monday after striking the year-to-date low, which analysts attributed to a flurry of trading in options that come due this week rather than due to any intervention moves from Japanese authorities.\n\"I'm inclined to also think that it wasn't a BOJ intervention... The bout of Japanese yen strength was very brief and reversed very quickly, and if it was a BOJ intervention, I would've expected a more long lasting yen strength,\" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\nDespite the BOJ's carefully orchestrated steps to phase out its controversial yield curve control (YCC) policy and hints of an imminent end to negative interest rates, the piecemeal moves have done little to sustain a rally in the yen, particularly as central banks globally maintain their hawkish rhetoric of higher-for-longer rates.\n\"I think the market has come to the realisation that the Bank of Japan is going to exit its policy but at a very, very, very slow and cautious pace,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (NAB).\n\"A weak yen is probably going to stay here for a little bit longer, and the market has been testing to see what the appetite is, particularly for the (Ministry of Finance) and the BOJ, to allow for weaker levels.\"\nJapanese authorities in September last year intervened in the currency market to boost the yen for the first time since 1998, after a BOJ decision to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy drove the yen as low as 145 per dollar.\nIt intervened again in October 2022 after the yen plunged to a 32-year low of 151.94.\nINFLATION AND THE FED\nOutside of Asia, traders also had their attention on U.S. inflation figures due later on Tuesday, which will provide further clarity on whether the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates even more to tame inflation.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and his chorus of policymakers have in recent days pushed back against market expectations that the U.S. central bank was done with its aggressive rate-hike cycle after it held rates steady at its latest policy meeting.\nThe comments have kept the U.S. dollar bid and against the greenback, the New Zealand dollar fell to an over one-week low of $0.58705.\nSterling eased 0.03% to $1.2274, while the euro gave up 0.02% to trade at $1.06965.\n\"Overall, the market is also kind of worn out by all messages coming from central banks and the higher-for-longer and wait-and-see mode is keeping volatility low,\" said NAB's Catril.\n\"We need to wait for that CPI number tonight, which could be a bit of a shaker. If it's strong, then obviously it brings in the idea that another rate hike from the Fed is there.\"\nDown Under, the Australian dollar dipped 0.1% to $0.6370.\nDomestic data was mixed with Australian business conditions holding firm in October, but consumer confidence sliding in the wake of last week's rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n(Reporting by Rae Wee.

It is due to expire in September 2025, and discussions are currently under way for its possible renewal.\n\"(An extension of) 10 to 20 years is very critical to the investment community. Anything lower than that would generate uncertainty,\" Muchanga told the ministers, who gathered in Johannesburg to form a common position on the future of the programme.\nThe African ministers are due to meet with U.S. officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, on Friday and Saturday.\nU.S. lawmakers and the Biden administration have voiced support for renewing AGOA, which saw over $10 billion worth of African exports enter the United States duty free last year.\nHowever, there is debate in Washington over whether the initiative needs updating.\nConstance Hamilton, the Biden administration's top trade official for Africa, said last week that Congress should consider changes that would \"make the programme more impactful\".\nAfrican governments and some U.S. industry groups warn that attempting to modify AGOA as part of the renewal process could delay its reauthorisation.\n\"If there are any enhancements to be made, those should be done after the extension,\" Muchanga said.\nAGOA's duty free provisions are currently one-sided. U.S. exports to African markets remain subject to national tariffs. Some U.S. lawmakers have in the past suggested the programme should be made more reciprocal.\nAfrica is in the process of setting up a new continent-wide free trade area, known as the AfCFTA, that aims to bring together 1.3 billion people in a $3.4 trillion economic bloc. Once fully implemented it will be the largest free trade area since the establishment of the World Trade Organization.\nMuchanga told the ministers that many of the U.S. officials and lawmakers he had met to discuss AGOA's renewal had assumed U.S. exports would be granted duty free entrance to the AfCFTA.\n\"I've told them very, very frankly that that is not possible,\" he said. \"If they try to export goods from the United States of America into Africa, they are going to meet national tariffs.\"\nThe Biden administration said on Oct. 30 it intended to end the participation of Gabon, Niger, Uganda and the Central African Republic in AGOA over governance and rights failings.\n(Reporting by Joe Bavier, Editing by William Maclean)",

She will take over on Jan. 2, while Wolfe Herd will remain executive chair, Bumble said in a statement.\n\"We view Whitney's departure as a near-to-midterm headwind for business operations and a negative for overall company morale,\" said analysts at Evercore ISI.\nThis is the second big executive departure this year at Bumble following the exit of President Tariq Shaukat, who stepped down after three years in the role.\nWolfe Herd, 33, launched the company in 2014 after an acrimonious departure from Match Group-owned rival app Tinder, which she had co-founded. Bumble's eponymous app stood out in the industry by allowing women to make the first move.\nIn recent years, Bumble, which counts Friends, Badoo, Fruitz (for Gen Z) and Official in its portfolio of dating services, has faced pressure to grow due to unrest in some markets like eastern Europe and competition from larger rival Match.\n\"Bumble has failed to execute on its vision of becoming a broader women's platform for beyond dating use cases like friendship and professional networking.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Some of the largest US companies face billions of dollars in additional interest costs and hits to their profit if they refinance their 2024 maturities at current rates, with a third of them lacking the cash to repay upcoming debt.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nS&P 500 Up 2% as Bets \u2018Fed Is Done\u2019 Sink US Yields: Markets Wrap\nRolex, Patek Prices Hit Fresh Two-Year Lows: Subdial Index\nBiden, Xi to Announce China\u2019s Crackdown on Fentanyl Trade\nThailand Takes $28 Billion Malacca Strait Bypass Plan to US\nTrump Insists on \u2018Disclaimer\u2019 Defense Already Tossed in NY Fraud Trial\nNon-financial companies in the S&P 500 have a combined $107.7 billion in debt coming due next year, with an average interest rate of 2.8%, according to a Calcbench analysis seen first by Bloomberg News. Refinancing at 5.44% \u2013 the rate of the one-year Treasury bill in early November \u2013 would add another $3.09 billion in collective interest expense, the financial research firm said in its analysis. Calcbench focuses on debt disclosures and analysis of financial statements.\nUsing companies\u2019 trailing twelve-month earnings per share ending with the second quarter as a baseline, that higher interest expense would reduce average EPS at 57 businesses with maturing debt in 2024 by $0.11, or 2.92%, Calcbench said. Still, for many of these firms, refinancing or raising money by selling assets is necessary to deal with upcoming debt maturities, especially if they don\u2019t have enough cash.\n\u201cDepending on the nature of the company and the strength of its balance sheet, this is significant,\u201d said Pranav Ghai, the founder and chief executive of Calcbench.\nCompanies are impacted by higher financing costs differently, with about two thirds of businesses holding enough cash to pay down their 2024 debt. The rest \u2014 or 19 companies out of the 57 \u2014 didn\u2019t hold enough cash by the end of the second quarter to extinguish all debt coming due next year, and those numbers have further updated in the most recent quarter.\n\u201cWe found numerous companies where higher interest expense was greater than available cash the companies had on hand, which implies that those companies must refinance or sell off assets to raise more cash,\u201d Ghai said. \u201cThey can\u2019t otherwise pay off the debt.\u201d\nUS firms have been rushing to the market as Treasury rates declined, with highly rated companies raising $1.115 trillion in new debt through Nov. 13, up 1% compared with the prior-year period. Last week alone, investment-grade issuers sold $43 billion in new bonds, with forecasts calling for $100 billion in gross new issuance this month.\nThe cut-off point for Calcbench\u2019s analysis was Nov. 6, with third-quarter results for several dozen S&P 500 companies still outstanding.\nRefinancing Needs\nOne of the companies that holds less cash than its 2024 maturities, according to Calcbench, is pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc. The company has $1.9 billion in debt coming due next year and reported $497 million in cash at the end of the second quarter. Cash holdings declined to $80 million in the third quarter.\nThe company\u2019s 2024 maturities are a small portion of its overall debt, according to its Chief Financial Officer David Michels.\n\u201cWe intentionally spread out our maturity profile in order to minimize annual refinancing impacts,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, at the end of the third quarter, we had over $3.5 billion of short-term liquidity under our credit facilities, which gives us flexibility to remain patient when refinancing our debt.\u201d\nMeanwhile, cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc. is anticipating higher financing costs for next year, said CFO Emmanuel Babeau. While the company wasn\u2019t included in Calcbench\u2019s analysis, it has several maturities in 2024, including $2.65 billion in dollar-denominated debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cWe go through a number of refinancings, some of them next year,\u201d Babeau said.\nUS companies across industries are grappling with whether to refinance their upcoming maturities at the risk of hurting profit or wait until interest rates are lower. The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged in early November, and Wall Street banks are divided on how aggressive they think the US central bank will be in cutting rates next year.\nCostco Wholesale Corp. and biotechnology firm Boston Scientific Corp. are among those that are expected to see a hit to basic EPS if they refinance at current rates, according to Calcbench estimates based on trailing 12-month earnings at the end of the second quarter.\nBoston Scientific \u2014 with $500 million coming due next year and over $1 billion in early 2025 \u2014 will likely see a hit to EPS of 0.83% in 2024, followed by a hefty 4.14% dent to EPS in 2025, Calcbench said. A representative for the Marlborough, Massachusetts-based company said the impact of higher financing costs on its EPS isn\u2019t clear-cut.\n\u201cThere are many approaches we can take when looking at our capital structure,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nCostco is considering repaying a $1 billion bond maturing in 2024 with cash, according to CFO Richard Galanti.

Barkin offered up a litany of ideas for states and localities, including issuing more permits for private single-family homes, reducing unnecessary regulation, and lobbying those who don\u2019t want their towns or communities to change.\nHe also cited some examples of changes in certain parts of the US designed to welcome more housing and boost supply. One government body in Virginia \u2014Wise County \u2014 implemented a tax incentive for renovation, rehabilitation, or replacement of residential and commercial properties.\nIn West Virginia, he said, a newly created Build WV program offers a tax exemption for purchasing construction materials, a 10-year property value tax credit, and the potential for a business and occupation tax exemption.\nBarkin\u2019s comments come as mortgages hover a near multi-decade high of nearly 8%, following an aggressive campaign over the past year and a half to fight inflation by boosting interest rates.\nThese higher rates are contributing to the affordability problem and also indirectly contributing to the supply issue by discouraging homeowners who locked in lower rates from selling.\nThe lack of supply is also rooted in the last housing crisis of 2008, which discouraged builders from taking chances on new development in the debacle's aftermath.\nBarkin said another key question in the quest for more housing supply is what communities are doing to make affordable land more available. Barkin says rezoning is needed to unlock land. He also said states should pitch the conversion of industrial sites into homes for residential home developers.\n\"The key is more supply,\" said Barkin. \"To create that supply, communities need to own the problem, compete for developers, innovate in offering affordable land and lowering costs, and engage with nontraditional partners.\"\nHomeownership \"is becoming increasingly unattainable for too many workers.\"\nClick here for real estate and housing market news, reports, and analysis to inform your investing decisions.",

The conglomerate also reported operating earnings of $10.76 billion, a jump on the prior year, as it benefited from the impact of elevated interest rates on the cash pile and gains at its insurance businesses.\nDespite ramping up Berkshire\u2019s acquisition machine in recent years, the company has still struggled to find many of the big-ticket deals that galvanized Buffett\u2019s renown, leaving him with more cash than he and his investing deputies could quickly deploy. After hanging back during the pandemic, he\u2019s since snapped up shares in Occidental Petroleum Corp. and struck a $11.6 billion deal to buy Alleghany Corp. Buffett has also leaned heavily on share repurchases amid the dearth of appealing alternatives, saying the measures benefit shareholders.\n\u201cCash deployment is definitely slowing,\u201d said Jim Shanahan, an analyst with Edward Jones. \u201cUltimately Berkshire\u2019s going to start feeling some pressure to put cash to work.\u201d\nThe deal drought hasn\u2019t damped investor enthusiasm for the company. Its Class B shares crested a record high in September as investors sought out its diversified range of businesses as a hedge against deteriorating economic conditions. And while the shares pared some of those gains, the stock is still up almost 14% for the full year.\nRead More: Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Rallies to Record High on Earnings Beat\nThe firm also spent $1.1 billion on buybacks in the period, bringing the total for the first nine months of the year to about $7 billion. The conglomerate trimmed its overall equities portfolio in the quarter, making about $5.25 billion on sales net of purchases.\nIncluding investment and derivatives losses, Berkshire posted a loss for the quarter of almost $12.8 billion \u2014 wider than the year prior \u2014 primarily due to losses on its equities portfolio. Berkshire often recommends that investors look past investment gains or losses, which are tied to accounting rules, saying that can be misleading to investors.\nOperating Units\nThe company operates and invests in all corners of the US economy, owning businesses including Geico, BNSF, Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candies, meaning investors view the company as a window into broader economic health.\nStrength in the insurance unit \u2014 plus the inclusion of Pilot Flying J earnings which Berkshire did not include in results last year \u2014 helped drive profitability. Berkshire said its insurance businesses posted a profit of $2.42 billion versus a loss in the prior-year period, when the insurance industry was being pummeled by catastrophes.\nThe company\u2019s Geico unit, which had struggled with unprofitability throughout 2022, also posted a profit compared to the same period a year ago, as it curtailed advertising expenses by 54% year-to-date. The improvement follows efforts by the division to overhaul underwriting after struggling with higher costs for replacing or repairing damaged vehicles. The effort cost it market share \u2014 raising the question if it will seek to reclaim that ground.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\u201cBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s results again demonstrated diversity of earnings power, boding well in uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Operating-company earnings of almost $10 billion were better than our core scenario as a rebound in Insurance, including favorable reserve trends and higher investment income, offset declining railroad earnings and energy litigation costs.\u201d\nMatthew Palazola, BI senior industry analyst, and Eric Bedell, BI associate analyst\nBerkshire posted stronger operating earnings despite Buffett cautioning at its annual meeting in Omaha in May that earnings at the majority of its operating units could fall this year as an \u201cincredible period\u201d for the US economy draws to the end. Still, the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive pace of rate hikes has helped the firm reap greater yield on the cash it stockpiles primarily in short-dated US Treasuries.\nRead More: Warren Buffett Predicts Earnings Decline at Berkshire Units\nAt the same time, those higher rates created headaches for some of Berkshire\u2019s industrial businesses. The conglomerate\u2019s building products businesses saw revenue slip 11% due to the run-up in mortgage rates.\n\u201cThe effects of significant increases in home mortgage interest rates in the US over the past year has slowed demand for our home building businesses and our other building products businesses,\u201d Berkshire said in a report detailing results. \u201cWe continue to anticipate certain of our businesses will experience weakening demand and declines in revenues and earnings into 2024.\u201d\nInflation weighed on other segments of the conglomerate.

By March, it said, the Fed will start to slightly tweak rates lower.\n\"However, as the slowdown in the economy and the extra disinflationary leg begin in earnest, we expect the Fed in the second half of the year to turn to full-on accommodation, with more rate reductions, in line with what it has done historically.\"\nUBS said it expected the Fed to cut rates by 275 basis points, leaving the effective federal funds rate at 2.50%-2.75%. The Fed currently has rates set at 5.25% to 5.50%.\nThat's well ahead of market expectations indicated by data from the CME FedWatch Tool, which expects just 75 basis points of cuts in 2024 that will send the fed funds rate to 4.50%-4.75%.\nDriving UBS's sharp estimate for a reduction in interest rates is their expectation that disinflation will continue throughout 2024, giving the Fed confidence that inflation has been tamed amid slowing economic growth.\nUBS said that it expected the Fed to get serious about cutting interest rates in 2024 and that a lack of fiscal policy support from Washington, DC, would drive the Fed to move forward with the interest-rate cuts.\n\"The historically wide budget deficit, a coming presidential election, and a fractured political landscape to us implies little room for cyclical fiscal support,\" UBS explained.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

        "text": "\nPUEBLO, Colo. (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden used a backdrop of the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing to sharpen his criticism of Republicans Wednesday, saying the company's expansion validates an environmental agenda his political opponents want to undo.\nThe company that Biden visited, CS Wind, is on the home turf of Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who has described the president's climate policies as \u201ca massive failure.\u201d\n\"Did you all know that you\u2019re part of a massive failure?\u201d Biden said to the workers and local officials gathered for his speech as he touted hundreds of new jobs fueled by tax incentives for clean energy initiatives. \u201cNone of that sounds like a massive failure to me. How about you?\u201d\nBiden\u2019s rebuttal to Boebert was fresh evidence of the Democratic president's intention to more aggressively push back against what he calls \u201cMAGA Republicans.\" He has been struggling with low approval ratings, and Democrats are anxious for him to gain ground politically ahead of a likely rematch against Donald Trump next year.\nBoebert, who has cultivated a national reputation as a right-flank insurgent, taunted Biden from Washington, where she said, \u201cI hope there\u2019s not a silver alert that goes out for him\u201d during his trip. The alerts can be sent for missing elderly people with dementia.\nPueblo, a city of about 110,000 south of Denver, is one of the anchors of Colorado\u2019s sprawling 3rd Congressional District, which covers more ground than Pennsylvania. Boebert won her seat in 2020 and barely held on to it during the 2022 midterms.\nDemocrats are eyeing it as one of their top pickup opportunities as they aim to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives, which is narrowly controlled by Republicans. Boebert suggested, \u201cJoe Biden coming to my district probably helps me win reelection.\u201d\nShe recently suffered an embarrassing episode when she was kicked out of a musical production of \u201cBeetlejuice,\u201d where she was spotted vaping. She faces a likely rematch against Democratic candidate Adam Frisch.\nDuring his speech in Pueblo, Biden rejected criticisms that his policies are a form of socialism.\n\u201cMy plan is rooted in what has always worked best for this country: Investing in America. Investing in Americans,\u201d Biden said, putting his hand on the shoulder of a worker wearing a bright yellow safety vest.\nBiden was originally scheduled to visit Pueblo on Oct. 16, but the trip was postponed so he could remain in Washington to focus on the conflict in the Middle East. Two days later he went on a last-minute trip to Israel to show support for the country after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.\nCS Wind is undergoing a $200 million expansion that is expected to create 850 jobs by 2026 with help from the tax benefits in Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which included hundreds of billions of dollars of financial incentives.\nIn addition, a new analysis from the Treasury Department said clean energy investments have mostly flowed to communities with below-average wages and above-average child poverty. The White House said the data indicated that Biden's policies are expanding economic opportunity.\nBiden arrived in Colorado on Tuesday after attending a memorial service in Atlanta for Rosalynn Carter, the former first lady and wife of former President Jimmy Carter. He spoke at a Tuesday night fundraiser in Denver, where he said Trump and Republicans want to abandon his administration's efforts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now investing in America,\u201d he said.\nBiden in recent weeks has been taking an increasingly confrontational stance toward Republicans. For example, during a White House event focused on supply chains on Monday, he unleashed a broad critique.\n\u201cThey want to go back to the bad old days, when corporations looked around the world to find the cheapest labor they could find, to send the jobs overseas, and then import the products back to the United States,\u201d he said.\nBiden also said Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare, benefits that are crucial for many elderly Americans.\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t give up,\" he said. \"But guess what: We won\u2019t let these things happen.\u201d\n___\nMegerian reported from Washington.

The Asian nation imposed anti-dumping tariffs of up to 218% on wine in March 2021, decimating what had been one of Australia\u2019s major overseas markets.\nAustralia suspended its World Trade Organization case against the wine tariffs in October after reaching an agreement to \u201cmove forward to resolve this dispute.\u201d As part of that agreement, Beijing was to review the tariffs, a process expected to take five months, the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement at the time, adding that it was \u201cconfident of a successful outcome.\u201d\nChina imposed tariffs on wine and barley in an apparent attempt to punish Australia after then Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in 2020 called for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, angering Beijing.

Hon Hai, the listed arm of Foxconn Technology Group, and fellow iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp. fell in Taipei on Friday.\nStill, Cook said the iPhone continues to make inroads in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market. Various models accounted for the four top-selling phones in urban China, he said.\n\u201cChina is an incredibly important market,\u201d the CEO said during a post-earnings conference call with analysts. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very optimistic about it.\u201d He didn\u2019t face any direct questions about the situation.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nApple\u2019s conference call did little to ease fears about a potential slowdown of product sales in China, which were notably below consensus at $15 billion, down 2.5% vs. last year, compared with expectations of a 10% increase. Services growth of 16% was the biggest positive surprise, helping to counter weak sales in China, and could be in double digits again in fiscal 1Q. Overall, these results and the 1Q outlook lead us to believe that fiscal 2024 sales growth will likely be about 2% lower than consensus of 5.6%.\n- Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard, BI analysts\nClick here for the full research\nThe iPhone 15 went on sale on Sept. 22 \u2014 only about a week before the quarter ended \u2014 so the latest results only provide an early sense of how the device is doing. Investors will get a clearer picture when Apple reports its holiday results early next year.\nIf the overall China smartphone market is contracting \u2014 as analysts have said \u2014 Apple\u2019s results suggest that it\u2019s winning market share, Cook said. He also touted that the company is opening a new store in the country this week. It\u2019s coming to Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province and will be the company\u2019s 46th in the region.\nCook was in China last month and said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more excited\u201d about the interactions he had with customers and employees, reiterating Apple\u2019s commitment to manufacturing in the country. Beijing announced its investigation into Foxconn about a week after.\n(Updates with shares in second paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nShipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\nFoxconn Makes Your iPhone.

It did not disclose terms, but people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that Silver Point provided $500 million of financing.\nThe suitor that made the most progress in the sale process for GOJO was Georgia-Pacific, a company owned by Koch Industries, the sources said. The terms of Georgia-Pacific's unsuccessful offer could not be learned.\nA GOJO spokesperson said that the company explored a range of options, but declined to outline them.\n\u201dWe have selected and are pleased with our path moving forward,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nSilver Point, Georgia-Pacific and Koch Industries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nGOJO was founded in 1946, when rubber factory worker Goldie Lippman and her husband, Jerry, partnered with chemistry professor Clarence Cook to invent what became the world's first one-step, rinse-off hand cleaner. The company expanded into skincare and invented Purell, an alcohol-based hand cleaner which dries on its own, in 1988. The company launched Purell in the consumer market in 1997.\nGlobal revenue in the hand sanitizing industry skyrocketed from about $1 billion in 2019 to $6.3 billion in 2020, according to Statista Market Insights, as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand. But sales dropped to $2.95 billion in 2022 as the pandemic subsided. Statista forecasts the market to grow by 3.96% on a compounded annual basis over the next four years.

That has opened more market opportunities such that across Nigeria, for instance, young people on social media are steadily opening fashion brands.\n\u201cAfricans want to wear Africa. It\u2019s really beautiful to see because it hasn\u2019t always been like this,\u201d said Omoyemi Akerele, who founded the Lagos Fashion Week in 2011 to encourage the patronage of Nigerian and African fashion. \u201cBut fast forward, a decade after, that\u2019s all people want to wear.\"\nFeaturing a mix of designers from across the continent, the annual fashion show celebrates \u2014 and provides a market for \u2014 local brands mostly highlighting African culture and crafts in various colours and styles.\nIn Nigeria and other parts of Africa, young fashion designers are hungry for success and are taking over the global scene, said the UNESCO director-general.\n\u201cA new breed of young designers is causing a stir in the international scene, reinventing the code of luxury while at the same time reconciling them with the demands of sustainable, local fashion and heritage,\" she said.\nOne such designer at the Lagos Fashion Week, Ejiro Amos-Tafiri, said she uses her brand to tell African stories while celebrating \u201cthe sophistication, class and uniqueness of every woman.\u201d\n\u201cWith more exposure, people are coming to realize that there is a lot of culture in the Nigerian culture, particularly in the fashion industry,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Africa is really the next frontier (for the fashion industry).\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press journalist Dan Ikpoyi in Lagos, Nigeria contributed.",

Payments that did not go through late last week had to be resent, a process that can take time.\nIt\u2019s not clear how widespread the impact continues to be or how long it will take for all customers to receive their deposits.\nThe Clearing House, the private operator of ACH, told CNN on Monday it is working with banks and the Federal Reserve to \u201cresolve this issue as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\u201cMany of the delayed payments have already posted, and we will continue working with financial institutions to ensure the remaining transactions are processed,\u201d The Clearing House spokesperson Greg MacSweeney said in an email.\nAn industry source confirmed to CNN on Monday that it\u2019s likely some customers haven\u2019t received their deposits yet. The source stressed that banks are at the mercy of the originating bank to resend payment files.\nFederal regulators are watching closely.\nIn a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the agency is \u201caware of the issue and monitoring how institutions are responding.\u201d\n\u201cThis brief disruption underscores the importance of the nation\u2019s payments infrastructure,\u201d the CFPB spokesperson said.\nAs of Monday afternoon, Bank of America and Chase are among the companies where users are reporting problems on Downdetector.\nWells Fargo, US Bank, Truist and other banks where users reported problems on Friday ranked lower on Downdetector.\nSome customers are complaining they still haven\u2019t been paid, while others say they have received their direct deposits.\n\u201cBruh, what\u2019s wrong with @BankofAmerica I can\u2019t even pay my bills,\u201d said one user on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nAnother user on Downdetector wrote to Wells Fargo complaining that payday was Friday and on Monday nothing had been updated.\n\u201cWells Fargo can y\u2019all speed it up? Some of us do have bills to pay!\u201d the user said.\nWells Fargo told CNN the bank will update account balances as originating financial institutions reissue deposits. \u201cWe continue to work directly with our customers,\u201d Wells Fargo spokesman Jim Seitz said.\nBank of America continues to display an alert to online customers warning them that \u201csome deposits may be temporarily delayed\u201d because of an \u201cissue impacting multiple financial institutions.\u201d\n\u201cYour accounts remain secure, and your balance will be updated as soon as the deposit is received,\u201d Bank of America said in the alert. \u201cYou do not need to take any action.\u201d\nChase explained to customers in a message posted on Downdetector that a \u201csystem issue\u201d impacted ACH debits and credits sent to it and other banks.\n\u201cThe originators of these deposits are working to resend the payment files and we will post them as soon as we can,\u201d Chase said in the message.\nAsked for comment, multiple banks referred inquiries to The Clearing House, which is owned by the largest commercial banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, CitiBank and Wells Fargo.\nMacSweeney, The Clearing House spokesperson, told CNN on Monday that the problem started as a \u201cprocessing error\u201d on Thursday where some ACH payment instructions were sent to financial institutions with account numbers and customers \u201cmasked.\u201d That missing data meant that some ACH payments were delayed.\n\u201cThe November 2nd error was an unfortunate and isolated issue, and immediate steps have been taken to prevent a reoccurrence,\u201d The Clearing House spokesperson said. \u201cThe ACH network continues to operate normally, processing tens of millions of electronic payments each day.\u201d\nThe Federal Reserve alerted banks Friday afternoon there was a \u201cprocessing issue\u201d at ACH, the system that allows banks to send electronic payments to each other. Banks use that system to send everything from direct deposit paychecks and Social Security checks to customer bill payments for mortgages and utilities.\nThe Fed noted that the problem originated in the private-sector operator The Clearing House.\nThe Clearing House previously said the problem was caused by a \u201cmanual error\u201d and was not linked to a cybersecurity issue.\nMacSweeney said the problem impacted less than 1% of the daily ACH volume in the United States.\nOf course, 1% of a massive system is still a large amount. The ACH Network processed an average of $330 billion per day in September, according to Nacha, a nonprofit that governs the network.\nMultiple customers complained online over the weekend and on Monday about a lack of communication from their bank about the delayed deposits.\nDennis Kelleher, CEO of financial reform advocacy firm Better Markets, was not surprised.\n\u201cThere always seems to be a conspiracy of silence in the industry when things go wrong\u2026 There should be full transparency so that the public is informed and that there is a basis for confidence that the problems have actually been fixed,\u201d Kelleher told CNN. \u201cWithout transparency you can\u2019t have oversight or accountability, which erodes trust and confidence.\u201d\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

Vietnam-born Duong, who came to Australia in 1980 as a refugee, faces a potential 10-year prison sentence if convicted in the landmark case.\nHe is the first person to be charged under federal laws created in 2018 that ban covert foreign interference in domestic politics and make industrial espionage for a foreign power a crime. The laws offended Australia\u2019s most important trading partner, China, and accelerated a deterioration in bilateral relations.\nThe allegation centers on a novelty check that Duong handed then-Cabinet minister Alan Tudge at a media event in June 2020 as a donation toward the Royal Melbourne Hospital\u2019s pandemic response.\nThe 37,450 Australian dollar (then equivalent to $25,800, now $24,200) donation had been raised from Melbourne\u2019s local Chinese diaspora.\nDefense lawyer Peter Chadwick told the jury Duong denied \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d prosecutors\u2019 allegations that he had attempted to influence Tudge with the check. Duong was the local president of the community group Oceania Federation of Chinese Organizations, a global group for people of Chinese heritage from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.\nChadwick also denied that Duong, who is widely known as Sunny, had been recruited by or collaborated with anyone associated with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\u201cThe fear of COVID hung like a dark cloud over the Chinese community in Melbourne,\u201d Chadwick told the court.\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that Mr. Duong and other ethnic Chinese members of our community decided that they wanted to do something to change these unfair perceptions,\u201d Chadwick added.\nProsecutors allege Duong told colleagues he expected Tudge would become Australia\u2019s next conservative prime minister. But Tudge quit Parliament this year, several months after the center-left Labor Party won elections.\nDuong stood as a candidate for the conservative Liberal Party in Victoria elections in 1996 and had remained active in party politics.\nParty official Robert Clark testified on Friday that he dismissed as \u201cvery superficial and na\u00efve\u201d several of Duong\u2019s policy suggestions.\nThe suggestions included China building Australia\u2019s first high-speed train line between Melbourne and Brisbane.\nProsecutors opened their case on Thursday with allegations that Duong had secret links to global efforts to advance the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\u201cBefore you start thinking of spy novels and James Bond films, this is not really a case about espionage,\u201d prosecutor Patrick Doyle told the jury.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a case about spies as such. It\u2019s a case about a much more subtle form of interference. It\u2019s about influence,\u201d Doyle added.\nThe trial continues next week.",

He also wrote the annual list, a monthly strategy essay, and worked with colleagues on putting together a model portfolio of stocks.\nHe moved from the investment bank to hedge fund Pequot Capital Management where he worked until it went out of business in 2009. Soon after, at age 76, when most people were enjoying retirement, Wien joined private equity firm Blackstone to offer direction and guidance. He was vice chairman of Blackstone's Private Wealth Solutions group.\n\"Byron's life was remarkable in so many ways,\" Blackstone Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray said in a statement to Blackstone employees. \"He was always building new relationships and pushed everyone around him to think about the risks and opportunities that lay ahead.\"\nHis annual list, which he published for 38 consecutive years, focused on a range of topics from who might win U.S. presidential elections, to the role China would play in markets, to where the stock index would move next.\nHe called the list a \"defining product\" adding people all over the world identified him with it. \"I put myself at risk by going on record with these events, which I believe are probable and hold myself accountable at year-end,\" he said earlier this year.\nWhile the list was closely watched, it also drew some scorn.\n\"My wife hopes I give this up as soon as possible,\" Wien told the New York Times about writing it. \"While people are enjoying the holidays, between Thanksgiving and Christmas I am in a total panic, working quite hard on developing these,\" he told the newspaper in 2001.\nIn addition to calling how markets might move, he offered life advice and encouraged people to \"read all the time,\" to \"get enough sleep\" and \"travel extensively.\"\nWien was orphaned as a young man but was sent by a guidance counselor at school to apply to Harvard where he ended up earning his undergraduate and graduate business degrees.\nHe found his way to Wall Street after stints in advertising and consulting.\nHe told the New York Times in 1985 \"I'm not sure I can do this job,\" about the strategist role at Morgan Stanley. \"But if I can do it, I will derive more satisfaction from this job than from going somewhere else and being a portfolio manager.\"\nOne of his life lessons, published in February, was \"never retire.\"\n\"If you work forever, you can live forever. I know there is an abundance of biological evidence against this theory, but I\u2019m going with it anyway,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Chris Reese)",

Stock was last up 4.2% in aftermarket trading.\n\"We have opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth while reducing our expenses, helping further drive operating leverage,\" Chriss said on a call with analysts, adding the company is working on a comprehensive plan for 2024.\nSeparately, it also named Jamie Miller as chief financial officer effective Nov. 6, replacing acting finance chief Gabrielle Rabinovitch.\nMeanwhile, consumer spending has also held up remarkably well this year, keeping the outlook for PayPal bright going into the holidays, as retailers dangle steep discounts on everything from electronics to clothing to entice inflation-weary shoppers.\nPayPal said it expects adjusted profit for the full year to be about $4.98 per share from $4.95 earlier. Analysts on average had expected $4.92, according to LSEG data.\nAnalysts, however, remain focused on PayPal's margins that have underwhelmed investors in recent quarters.

Both are defending against the regulator's claims.\nThe SEC said Payward Inc and Payward Ventures Inc, which operate as Kraken, have since 2018 made hundreds of millions of dollars arranging crypto purchases and sales while turning a \"blind eye\" to securities laws designed to protect investors.\nKraken was also accused of having deficient internal controls and inadequate record keeping, reflected in part in its commingling customer money with its own and paying operating costs directly from customer accounts.\nFailing to register has \"resulted in a business model rife with conflicts of interest that placed investors' funds at risk,\" SEC enforcement chief Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. \"Kraken's choice of unlawful profits over investor protection is one we see far too often in this space.\"\nIn its statement, Kraken said the SEC complaint conceded that any alleged \"commingling\" amounted to \"no more than Kraken spending fees it has already earned.\"\nThe SEC also accused Binance of commingling customer funds, following a Reuters report describing such conduct. Binance has denied the commingling accusation.\nMonday's lawsuit seeks a civil fine, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and a halt to acting as an exchange without registering.\nKraken was founded in 2011. It is backed by investors including Blockchain Capital, Digital Currency Group, Hummingbird Ventures, SkyBridge and Tribe Capital.\nThe case is SEC v Payward Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 23-06003.

        "text": "\nBy David Gaffen and Manas Mishra\n(Reuters) - Healthcare companies who profit from treating obese and overweight patients are trying to convince investors that powerful new weight-loss drugs won't shrink their businesses.\nThe global market for obesity drugs could reach as much as $100 billion within a decade due to the effectiveness of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and similar medicines.\nSuch forecasts have prompted a sell-off in a wide range of companies from makers of bariatric surgery devices to companies whose products address the health issues created by excess weight, from diabetes to sleep apnea.\nHowever, those companies and analysts point to the high prices of the weight-loss drugs, uncertainty over long-term usage and the potential lack of insurance coverage for the costs as potentially limiting the market for them in the long run.\n\"The market is in a shoot-first, ask-questions-later mood when it comes to weight-loss drugs,\" said Nicholas Anderson, manager of the Thornburg International Growth Fund, which holds shares of Novo Nordisk. \"What's less clear on the losers side is who will actually be affected and how long will it take to show up in numbers.\"\nShares of Danish drug company Novo Nordisk are up 28% in the last three months. Eli Lilly, which is expected to soon introduce its own weight-loss drug Mounjaro, is up 25%, ballooning its market value to more than $550 billion, making it the world's most valuable health care company.\nBy contrast, the iShares U.S. Medical Devices exchange-traded fund has lost more than 22% in the last three months.\nInjectable weight-loss drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, are considered highly effective but are also expensive, costing more than $1,300 per month. Some competitors have questioned the potential reach of the GLP-1 market.\n\"We expect it will take at least a decade to reach peak penetration of these products in the indicated population,\" Kenneth Stein, Boston Scientific's global chief medical officer, told investors on Thursday, adding that only a minority of obese American patients will use the drugs. Boston Scientific said the effect on the company's heart devices would be \"very limited.\"\nMargaret Kaczor Andrew, a William Blair analyst covering medical technology companies, says she does not expect a meaningful effect on technologies like glucose monitors, which help manage diabetes. She pointed to the emergence of other drug classes like statins that had reduced cardiovascular disease but not decreased the need for heart devices.\n\"Ultimately, it does not impact device utilization,\" she said.\nMichael Farrell, CEO of Resmed, which makes devices to treat sleep apnea, said on an investor call Thursday that the company is \"tracking many thousands of patients on GLP-1 and we're seeing maintenance of adherence. We're seeing maintenance of resupply programs and really no change.\"\nWAIT AND SEE\nSome investors said the drugs could reduce the need for invasive weight-loss procedures like bariatric surgery.\n\"It seems very natural for people to try the drugs, see about the weight loss they get, and how long-lasting it is and then delay bariatric surgery or avoid it all together,\" said Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\nJohnson & Johnson said third-quarter medical device sales fell short of analyst estimates due to a slowdown in devices used in bariatric surgeries.\nYet only about one-third of patients prescribed a weight-loss drug like Wegovy were still taking it a year later, Reuters reported in July, citing an analysis of pharmacy claims data.\n\"We expect that many of them will not stay on the drug for longer than a year or two, and at that time, will consider bariatric surgery,\" Myriam Curet, chief medical officer at Intuitive Surgical, said on the company's Oct. 19 earnings call. \"Overall, we'll see an increased interest in bariatric surgery, but that will get delayed in the short term.\"\nThe weight-loss drugs' cost and uncertainty about whether their use will improve the long-term health of patients and reduce healthcare spending will limit near-term expansion of insurance coverage, said Ann Hynes, a healthcare services analyst at Mizuho Securities.\nShe recently held a call for investors with two health insurers with insight on corporate health plans.\n\"Nothing is going to change in '24. If anything, I think (insurance) access is going to get stricter. It could evolve in 2025, 2026,\" Hynes said.\n(Reporting by David Gaffen in New York and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Michael Erman and Caroline Humer in New York; Editing by Sonali Paul)",

He was 68.\nAt Li's funeral at a Beijing cemetery where high-ranking officials and national heroes are laid to rest, President Xi Jinping and his wife, with the six other members of the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee, the highest rung of political power in China, as well as Vice President Han Zheng paid their final respects.\nThe group stood in silence and took three bows, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nFormer President Hu Jintao sent a wreath to express his condolences over Li's passing, according to Xinhua.\nMessages for the late premier flooded social media platforms as Chinese citizens mourned his death.\nOn popular social media platform Weibo, which replaced its 'like' button with a chrysanthemum flower symbolising mourning on related posts, tens of thousands of people left comments bidding Li farewell on a Thursday post by China's national broadcaster.\nLi was the top trending topic on Weibo.

        "text": "\nWhen the dreaded cold months of winter arrive, it means many homeowners are put in a difficult conundrum to keep their homes warm without breaking the bank.\nAnd staying warm is becoming increasingly expensive.\nThe average cost of home heating is projected to remain at near record levels this winter after increases of an estimated 17.2% last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. The organization released a report in September finding that the average American household is expected to pay anywhere from $787 to $2,094 in heating costs between October and March.\nBut resourceful homeowners can find plenty of ways to cut down on costs.\nHere are some tips from experts on how to stay warm this winter while still reducing your heating bills:\nWhat is solar winter? What to know about the darkest time of year\nA heating system that's running efficiently saves money.\nThat means the pricey cost of paying for a professional to come to your home and inspect your unit (anywhere from $150 to $500, Consumer Reports estimates) can pay off in the long run.\nClimate-friendly heat pumps, for instance, can use up to 25% less fuel when they're well-maintained, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\nInspections include replacing dirty filters and checking for safety issues like carbon monoxide leaks.\nUnless you live alone, you've probably engaged in thermostat wars with a loved one or roommate who simply prefers to keep your residence at a different temperature. However, experts have helpful recommendations for the proper home temperature in the winter.\nThat magic number? 68 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Department of Energy.\nBut if that's too specific, anywhere around 70 degrees is a good target when it gets cold, Ram Narayanamurthy, deputy director of the U.S. Department of Energy's Building Technologies Office, told USA TODAY.\n\u201cA home that\u2019s at 70 degrees is quite comfortable,\u201d Narayanamurthy said.\nWhile 70 degrees is the ideal number, it's unwise to set your thermostat to one temperature and never change it. Lower temperatures may be ideal when sleeping at night or when you're away from your home, Narayanamurthy cautioned.\nNarayanamurthy said he usually sets his at 64 degrees if he leaves his home for an extended period of time, though everyone's comfort levels may be different.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want your heater turning on all the time when no one\u2019s at home,\u201d he said.\nPenny-pinchers may be tempted to set their thermostat at bracing levels and survive the winter by bundling up in layers or piling on blankets.\nWhile you'd have to set your home at a pretty low temperature for it to become a health risk, Narayanamurthy warns against going below 60 degrees.\n\u201cYou have to keep it really low to really get into a health concern,\" he said. \"What you want to do is keep it at a reasonable temperature that\u2019s not chilly.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization recommends keeping indoor temperatures between 64 and 75 degrees for healthy people. But for those who are very young, elderly, or who have health problems, the minimum temperature shouldn't dip below 68 degrees, the organization says.\nIs Toys R Us back? Toys R Us comeback continues with store opening inside Mall of America\nSmart thermostats enabled with Wi-Fi are becoming increasingly popular among many Americans, especially those who have replaced their furnace in recent years, Narayanamurthy said.\nIn fact, he estimated that up to 33% of households now have them.\nBecause many can connect to smartphones via mobile apps, smart thermostats provide the option for homeowners to program their thermostats while they're away from home or even set a schedule.\nSome advanced options are capable of recognizing a homeowner's pattern and adjusting the temperatures at certain times or even in certain rooms of the house.\nThe average Energy Star-certified smart thermostat can save about 8% of a homeowner's annual heating and cooling bills, according to Consumer Reports.\n\"There\u2019s a proven energy savings from a smart thermostat,\u201d Narayanamurthy said. \u201cThe aim is to make it more seamless to make your home more comfortable.\u201d\nMany homeowners may be tempted to rely on fireplaces, space heaters, electric blankets and wood-burning stoves to keep warm in the winter.\nAccording to Direct Energy, these types of secondary heating sources can help to slash costs since they offer heating to a more targeted area of your home at a fraction of the cost of cranking up the thermostat.\nBut many of these options come with their own safety risks and similarly require routine maintenance, care and even replacement.\nOnce a fire hazard, modern electric space heaters are much safer than they used to be with built-in safety features that turn the heaters off if they tip over, overheat, or have been left turned on for too long.\nAn energy-efficient audit could be a great way for homeowners to find where their heating and cooling efficiency is lacking, Narayanamurthy said.\nTrained energy assessors can evaluate homes for issues like insufficient insulation or a heating system that might warrant replacement and then develop a plan for homeowners to address issues and lower energy bills.\nThe Home Performance with Energy Star program, a collaboration between the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, matches consumers in 20 states with reputable home performance contractors for assessments.\nIf this all still sounds expensive, Narayanamurthy recommends you consider taking advantage of available rebates and tax credits through the Department of Energy.\nDue to the recently approved Inflation Reduction Act, now may be a great time to install energy-efficient products and replace heating systems that are 15 years old or older. Funding is available for all kinds of other upgrades as well, from doors to windows, and to insulation. More information is available at energysaver.gov.\nExperts offer a variety of other tips that, altogether, could cut down on cold air coming into your home and reduce the workload on your heating unit.\n\u25fe Weather-stripping doors and improving insulation help to keep warm are in and cold air out.\n\u25fe Draft air coming in through windows may mean they're in need of maintenance \u2013 or replacement altogether. But before getting new windows, homeowners can try to caulk them to prevent air leaks. If replacements are needed, Consumer Reporters recommends considering low-emissivity (low-e) storm windows, which are coated to help keep the warmth inside.\n\u25fe Cold air creeping in at the bottom of doors? A lengthy draft stopper (or even a rolled-up towel) is an inexpensive way to seal it off.\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The market is still not sure on U.S. growth.\"\nU.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in October, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said, while producer prices posted the biggest decline in three-and-a-half years last month, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nMore than 80% of the decline last month in the Producer Price Index for final demand goods was attributed to a 15.3% drop in gasoline prices, BLS said.\n\"The markets are anticipating rate cuts coming in the first couple of quarters next year,\" said Roosevelt Bowman, senior investment strategist at Bernstein Private Wealth Management in New York.\n\"But in our view, we just don't think that downward momentum in inflation is going to be nearly as fast as what the market is estimating,\" he said.\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency versus six others, rose 0.30%, off its two-month low of 103.98 on Tuesday. The euro was down 0.32% at $1.0844, after touching its highest since August the day before.\nInvestors have all but eliminated the likelihood of another rate hike when Fed policymakers meet in December, while bets of a rate cut in May 2024 increased to more than 65%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\nThe fourth quarter in the past two years has not been good for the dollar, which peaked in the third quarter of both 2021 and 2022 and sold off through to January each year, said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies in New York.\n\"I'm not necessarily saying that history is going exactly to repeat itself, but I don't necessarily want to be buying or getting long the dollar just yet,\" he said. \"We need to see more of this play out.\"\nEarlier in Britain, data showed inflation last month eased to 4.6%, its slowest pace in two years.

If we don't then we're probably in the context of a new early stage bull market here,\" he said.\n\"That's the question that investors are going to be asking themselves while watching yields - the information we get between now and the end of the year on yields and economic data as it relates to recession is going to drive the tape.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.33 points, or 0.12%, to 34,112.27; the S&P 500 gained 4.40 points, or 0.10 %, at 4,382.78; and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.56 points, or 0.08 %, at 13,650.41.\nThe Dow's decline snapped a seven-session winning streak.\nMeanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did not comment on monetary policy in opening remarks at the U.S central bank statistics conference on Wednesday. He is scheduled to speak at another conference on Thursday.\nLonger-dated yields fell and the 10-year Treasury yield was down on the day after a $40 billion auction analysts viewed as acceptable given the increased size.\nEli Lilly shares climbed 3.2% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drugmaker's weight loss treatment.\nIn earnings, Warner Bros Discovery plunged 19% after the media and entertainment conglomerate said Hollywood strikes and a weak advertising market could hurt 2024 earnings, weighing on peer Paramount Global.\nTake-Two Interactive Software jumped 5.2% after the company said it would release a trailer early next month for the latest installment in its best-selling \"Grand Theft Auto\" videogame franchise.\nElectric vehicle maker Lucid Group stumbled 8.1% after trimming its production forecast.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.3-to-1 ratio on the NYSE while on the Nasdaq declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.7-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and eight new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 53 new highs and 206 new lows.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 10.27 billion shares, compared with the 10.95 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "text": "\nMOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Three major Greek shipping firms have stopped transporting Russian oil in recent weeks in order to avoid U.S. sanctions now being imposed on some shipping firms carrying Russian oil, four traders told Reuters and shipping data showed.\nThe development is a blow to Russia as it narrows the number of shipping firms that are ready to transport Russian oil to consumers in Asia, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa and South America - although traders said Moscow still had enough shipping firms for now.\nGreek shippers Minerva Marine, Thenamaris and TMS Tankers have stopped transporting Russia oil in recent weeks, the four traders said.\nThenamaris said it doesn't comment on commercial matters. Minerva Marine and TMS Tankers didn't respond to requests for comment.\nAll three firms were active shippers of Russian oil and fuels up until September-October when they started scaling down their involvement, according to the traders and data from shipping agents seen by Reuters.\nAll three companies turned down requests for vessels for Russian crude loading in November and later, said the traders, who previously collaborated with the three firms.\nThe Greek shippers' exit from the trade followed tighter U.S. sanctions imposed on Russian oil shipments.\nIn October, Washington imposed the first sanctions on owners of tankers in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates carrying Russian oil above the G7's price cap of $60 a barrel. Last week, it imposed sanctions on three more ships.\nThe G7 countries introduced a price cap on Russian oil in late 2022, but had not previously enforced it. The price cap allows Western firms to provide shipping and insurance services for Russian crude as long as the oil is sold below $60 per barrel. The cap is designed to limit Russian export revenues.\nRussia's main export grade, Urals, has been trading above the $60 per barrel cap since mid-July amid production cuts by the OPEC+ group of oil producing countries, prompting many market watchers to say the price cap wasn't working.\nRussia's Pacific ESPO Blend crude oil grade has also traded above the cap, according to U.S. Treasury data.\nThe three Greek firms had been shipping Russian oil for decades and continued to do so when most other Western companies quit running the routes to avoid rising sanction risks and the imposition of the price cap.\nThe routes have been lucrative. Russian oil trade has brought record revenues over the past year to the shippers who took the risk and stayed in the business.\nFreight rates for Russian oil transportation jumped to as high as $15 million per tanker voyage from Baltic ports to India last winter as shippers charged high rates because of the risk. That was several times more expensive than shipments of non-sanctioned crude.\nThe three Greek companies operate more than 100 oil tankers capable of handling almost all the oil exports from Russia's European ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga and Novorossiisk of roughly 10 million tonnes a month or 2.4 million barrels per day.\nThey also operate a fleet of smaller tankers that transport fuel.\n\"The dark fleet might not be enough to transport all of Russian oil,\" one of the traders involved in Russian oil shipping said, referring to the emergence of the so-called \"dark fleet\" of shippers that move oil from sanctions-hit Russia and Iran and are not covered by Western insurance.\nHe cited as the main reason the fact that the Russian oil was now travelling 8-10 weeks to reach customers in Asia as opposed to two weeks before sanctions, when oil was sold in Europe. That means more tankers are required for the trade.\nHowever, for now Russia appears to be coping as other shipping companies stepped in, traders said.\nRussia is now relying on its shipping company Sovcomflot and a many little-known shipping firms registered in the UAE, India, Hong Kong, Seychelles, Ghana and other locations, according to traders and shipping data.\nThe vessels carry flags of different states from Liberia to the Cook Islands.\n(Reporting by Reuters reporters in Moscow, Jonathan Saul and Dmitry Zhdannikov in London, additional reporting by Eleftherios Papadimas in Athens; Editing by Susan Fenton)",

        "text": "\nBy Steven Scheer\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Five weeks into Israel's war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, Israelis are spending less but a recovery may have begun after a steep drop at the start of the conflict, the Bank of Israel said on Tuesday.\nThe central bank said that since the war's outbreak, credit card spending - a key indicator of consumer expenditures that is more than half of economic output - is down 9% from its forecast level, but off a low of 20% after the first three weeks.\nIt said spending, based on daily data received from Israel's credit card processing firm, has slid on education, flights, hotels, car rentals, fuel, transport and restaurants, but risen in supermarkets due to what it called \"the public's initial concerns of a shortage of products\" and calls by authorities to stockpile food for 72 hours.\nThe Bank of Israel said that credit card data are crucial for monetary policy since much of the data necessary for making economic policy decisions do not exist in real time, and sometimes the lag is several weeks to a few months.\n\"Credit card expenditures are a real-time indicator of the level of business and consumer activity,\" it said. \"These data make it possible to lower the extent of uncertainty with which economic policy decisions are made, and their use is very important during a crisis when there is increased uncertainty.\"\nThe use of credit card spending data, the central bank said, also made it possible to assess the level of activity during the war compared with the past. Current data show spending similar to the second COVID lockdown in September 2020 but higher than the first lockdown at the start of the pandemic in March 2020.\nAssuming the Gaza war remains concentrated along Israel's southern border with the enclave and lasts until the end of the year, the central bank projects GDP growth to fall by about 1% in 2023 and 2024 - translating to growth of 2.3% this year and 2.8% next.\nIts projections are more optimistic than those of S&P Global Ratings, which on Monday estimated growth for Israel of 1.5% in 2023 and 0.5% in 2024, with a contraction of 5% in the current quarter. The bank said any drawing of other regional players into the war would \"have more significant repercussions for Israel's economy\".\nAccording to the Economy Ministry, 19% of Israel's active labour force are not working due to the war, as many of them have been called up for military reserve duty.\n(Reporting by Steven Scheer; editing by Mark Heinrich)",

Venture Global LNG has said the Louisiana plant is not fully operational due to faulty power equipment that is being repaired.\nTheir appeals sought to get The Hague and Washington to pressure Venture Global LNG on the contracts. In its letter, Shell accused Venture Global LNG of diverting resources into building a second LNG export plant rather than completing repairs to its first plant.\nThe behavior \"has shaken confidence in the trustworthiness of American LNG suppliers,\" BP executive Carol Howle wrote in a separate letter. Whether the plant should be allowed to operate and export under rules governing construction should be explored by officials, she added.\nNO ACTION BY TASK FORCE\nOfficials from the EU and U.S. indicated they view the dispute as \"a contractual matter between commercial parties,\" a Venture Global LNG spokesperson said on Saturday. No action was taken on Shell's request at an Oct. 30 task force meeting.\nA Shell spokesman said on Saturday it was not expecting an immediate reaction by the task force, and wanted to bring a potential loss of trust in U.S. LNG to officials' attention. BP declined comment apart from its letter. Utility giant Edison did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the weekend.\nVenture Global LNG is operating the Calcasieu Pass plant at capacity, it has told U.S. regulators. And it has sold more than 200 cargoes worth about $18.2 billion to date, according to a Reuters tally. Those sales reaped higher prices than would be available under the four firms' long-term contracts.\nShell and others claim the firm has profited from the rally in global gas markets while short-changing Europe's energy security. They have been told they will not receive their contracted amounts until late 2024.\nBP and Shell have bought gas from the plant and sold it outside of Europe while citing Europe's energy security in letters to the U.S.-EU task force, Venture Global LNG said. The company is \"diligently working toward full completion.\" It did not say when full commercial operation would begin.\n\"Shell has purchased 7 commissioning cargoes from Venture Global and 3 of them were traded outside of Europe for higher profits. Similarly, BP has purchased 6 commissioning cargos, and 2 have been traded to destinations outside of Europe,\" according to a Nov. 10 letter signed by Venture Global Co-Chairman Michael Sabel and Robert Pender.\nThe exporter is in compliance with terms of its contracts and the criticisms by BP and Shell represent an attempt to \"litigate this through our regulators and in the media,\" the letter said.\nThe appeal to the U.S.-EU task force also follows Repsol's bid to have the U.S. energy regulator Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reopen its approval of the Calcasieu plant in view of the startup problems. That request was rejected.\n(Reporting by Gary McWilliams; editing by Diane Craft)",

Venture Global and the foundation customers have been in a legal dispute over its failure to deliver cargoes from the facility to them.\n\"FERC is saying the facility is approved to operate at full capacity while commissioning remains ongoing on other plants. It aligns with Venture Global's desire to delay the start of commercial operations,\" said Munton.\nVenture Global LNG is involved in contract arbitration with customers Shell, BP, Edison and Repsol that separately seeks to force the company to supply them cargoes or pay financial penalties.\n\"We agree with the modified commissioning plan that no longer bundles\" the newer liquefaction trains with the faulty power and other portions of the Louisiana plant, FERC said.\nShell was pleased with the FERC decision to put the additional processing trains into operation, because it showed the facility is able to operate at or above capacity without the power equipment, said Shell's spokesman Curtis Smith.\n\"Venture Global should immediately begin deliveries to its foundational customers,\" said Smith.\nTheir support \"provided the agreements needed to secure the financing and construction of the facility,\" he said.\nVenture Global started gas processing at its Calcasieu Pass facility in March 2022 and has delivered at least 200 cargoes - which it says are \"pre-commissioning cargoes\" - through September, according to a Reuters tally.\nBut the company has not provided cargoes to its contract customers, insisting the facility is not fully commissioned.\nVenture Global's original commissioning plan included three phases. The third phase involves starting up liquefaction trains 7-9, pre-treatment systems and power generation, according to the FERC document said. The revised plan splits the last three trains from the other systems in the commissioning process.\nCommissioning activities so far have shown the liquefaction facilities can operate above the authorized nameplate capacity and near the maximum capacity, despite the heat recovery steam generator tube leaks affecting the plant, FERC said.\n\"We will continue to work closely with our regulators as we progress the remaining work and commissioning activities needed to complete the facility,\" said Venture Global LNG spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes.

Now, it\u2019s planning a revival. There\u2019s fresh money flowing in, producers are venturing into new areas and traditional growers are receiving financial aid.\n\u201cThere is a huge opportunity for Brazil to regain a leading role in the global cocoa supply chain,\u201d said Valmir Ortega, the founder of Belterra Agroflorestas, a company planting cocoa trees across degraded rainforest areas. They have the support of giants like Cargill Inc. and an investment fund created by Vale SA.\nBrazil is looking to double cocoa production by 2030. That\u2019s one of the goals from a plan the country\u2019s cocoa commission Ceplac is announcing this week. As soon as 2025, Brazil should be producing enough to satisfy domestic demand, according to director Lucimara Chiari. That would reduce Brazil\u2019s need to import beans, helping ease a severe global shortage of the chocolate ingredient.\n\u201cOf all cocoa producing countries, Brazil has the greatest growth potential,\u201d Chiari said.\nThe development is much needed relief for the cocoa market, which has suffered from bad weather and crop disease in top growers Ivory Coast and Ghana. Such setbacks have dramatically shrunk global inventories, causing cocoa futures to soar almost 70% this year. The price for the most-active contract in London climbed for a second straight day on Friday to as high as \u00a33,476 per metric ton.\nCocoaAction Brasil mapped at least 24 ongoing projects to aid the local cocoa supply chain, with a total investment of over 150 million Brazilian reais ($30.6 million).\nRead More: Brace for Pricier Chocolate If Africa\u2019s Cocoa Crop Disappoints\nThe Brazil cocoa boom is already more than just a promise. Farmers in different areas of the country are planting new trees, which will bear fruit in the next two to three years.\nOne of those farmers is Moises Schmidt, who recently planted cocoa in Barreiras, a municipality of Bahia state located almost 600 miles (966 kilometers) away from traditional cocoa areas. He is now expanding plantations in partnership with Cargill. It\u2019s a marked shift for the family business Schmidt Agricola, which for over forty years specialized in growing cotton, soybeans and corn.\n\u201cCocoa farming was stuck in the past,\u201d Schmidt said. In contrast to the more traditional craft methods, his company made efforts to use new machinery and invest in seedlings that can resist the drier weather of his region. \u201cThat\u2019s the future.\u201d\nCocoa has become such a hot topic that even a biofuels company is now looking to produce the chocolate ingredient. Brasil Biofuels SA focuses on fuel made from palm oil, but started to add cocoa plants to its tree nursery, hoping to cultivate 1,000 hectares next year.\nTo be sure, Brazilian cocoa production is still a fraction of what is grown in Africa, a continent that accounts for almost three quarters of global supply. What makes Brazil relevant is the fact that at least some of its farmers have the means to respond to heightened global demand by boosting supplies, whereas in Africa many farmers live below the poverty line and their pay is set by authorities, so they don\u2019t immediately benefit from higher futures prices. Producers need money to invest, especially as new European rules require spending on traceability to prove crops weren\u2019t grown in deforested land.\nA larger Brazilian production could bring down cocoa prices, although that would only be a factor in the long term, analysts at the Hightower Report said Friday. For now, prices continue to be driven by the poor outlook in West Africa.\nProductivity of Brazilian farms is also lower than in Africa, but it has been improving, said Pedro Ronca, an agronomist and manager at the CocoaAction Brasil initiative. Many areas were still lacking the basic investments in soil treatments, as well as proper tree care. Providing farmers with access to financing and technical assistance is leading to significant yield gains, he said.\nPerhaps the biggest threat to Brazil\u2019s ambitious cocoa plans still lies in tree health. More than 30 years after the first deadly outbreak, a new disease called frosty pod rot is haunting farmers. Fighting such risk will require even more investments, said Anna Paula Losi, chief executive officer of industry group AIPC. She believes Brazilians are up for the job.\n\u201cWe have better knowledge and resources now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not the same.\u201d\n(Updates cocoa futures price in sixth paragraph, adds analysts comment in 13th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Airbnb Inc. and Bookings Holdings Inc. also rose, closing up 6.2% and 0.7% respectively.\nThe travel companies said on conference calls that consumers continue to spend on leisure travel despite inflationary pressure. They posted better-than-expected third-quarter results, buoyed by the strong summer travel season.\nAsia Pacific showed a strong recovery and recorded relatively faster growth than other regions as the last of the pandemic-related global travel restrictions have come down, allowing consumers to travel across borders and return to high-density urban destinations.\nExpedia announced a new $5 billion share buyback authorization, along with its upbeat results, and reiterated its full-year outlook for double-digit revenue growth with margin expansion.\nExpedia\u2019s executives also signaled confidence in further benefits from a years-long technical upgrade and a new loyalty program. That\u2019s despite missing on a bookings metric due to the fires in Maui, Hawaii.\nFor the fourth quarter, Expedia expects gross bookings growth to be relatively in line with third-quarter levels. The company sees modest acceleration in revenue growth, taking into account the uncertain geopolitical environment.\nAirbnb gave a disappointing outlook that indicated further deceleration in revenue growth and nights booked. It will be monitoring macro and geopolitical factors that could reduce travel demand as it saw early volatility and broad softness in the period.\nStill, the shares finished up 7.5% for the week.\nBookings Holdings, which has relatively bigger exposure to markets outside the US and especially the Middle East compared to peers, reported cancellations in Israel and a drop in bookings outside the country in October as people around the world absorbed the news about the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nThe company, the parent of Priceline and Kayak, said room night growth recovered toward the end of the month and its fourth-quarter outlook for that metric was slightly ahead of estimates.\nTravel Resilience\nThe companies remain upbeat about travel demand for the year ahead and the long term.

At Morgan Stanley, the sustainability research team is monitoring carbon regulations that are likely to inflate costs for companies. Meanwhile, Fidelity International Ltd. has started to account for Europe\u2019s impending taxes on carbon-intensive imports.\nPolitical debates about ESG aside, the rising price of carbon is a growing threat to returns. Half of the earnings for companies in the MSCI World Index are at risk of declining if global carbon prices reach $100 a ton by 2030, according to estimates by researchers at Lombard Odier. As of now, the price of carbon is less than $30 a ton, but Europe\u2019s new tariffs on carbon-intensive imports may hasten an increase, the Swiss asset manager said.\nEurope\u2019s so-called carbon border adjustment mechanism, or CBAM, is designed to create a level playing field by making sure that imports of certain goods are subject to the same carbon prices as domestic producers pay in Europe. While it doesn\u2019t take full effect until 2026, CBAM will likely \u201cpromote the rise and convergence of carbon prices towards the EU\u2019s level,\u201d which is about \u20ac75 ($82) a ton, Lorenzo Bernasconi, Lombard Odier\u2019s head of carbon solutions, said in a report.\nFor companies, there\u2019s a potential double whammy, as higher carbon prices mean higher operating costs and the CBAM tariffs mean higher expenses for importing carbon-intensive raw materials into Europe.\nRead More: How EU Will Charge for Emissions Outside Its Borders: QuickTake\nAs CBAM takes shape, \u201cwe are starting to build into our model how this additional tax is going to impact\u201d future cash flows, Flora Wang, Fidelity\u2019s head of stewardship in Asia, who\u2019s also a portfolio manager, said in an interview. As a result, she said Fidelity is reconsidering whether to invest in a big Chinese manufacturer of fertilizer and pesticides, one of the first industries subject to the new import taxes.\nWang didn\u2019t name the company. It has strong fundamentals and a near-monopoly, but a lot of its feed material is tied to coal refining, which means high emissions, and a big market of this company is in Europe, she said.\nCBAM is prompting other countries to consider enacting their own measures. The UK is weighing a similar mechanism, while others plan to raise carbon taxes rather than lose tax revenue to Europe.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more emissions trading markets across the globe, which is putting an explicit price on carbon emissions for a lot of the companies,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThat goes directly into the cost structure of a lot of companies we\u2019re investing in.\u201d\nTim Chan, Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of sustainability research for Asia-Pacific ex-Japan, said he and his team are watching Europe, because if its tariffs are \u201csuccessfully implemented, then there would be more incentive for China and Japan to gradually have a higher carbon price.\u201d Both countries currently have local emissions trading schemes, though volumes and prices remain relatively low.\nAt Invesco, the firm has begun inputting a range of carbon prices into its aggregated investment portfolios to simulate different future scenarios, said Alexander Chan, Asia-Pacific head of ESG client strategy.

        "text": "\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Disney on Tuesday released a study showing its economic impact in Florida at $40.3 billion as it battles Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his appointees over their takeover of the district that governs the entertainment company's massive theme park resort in central Florida.\nDisney accounted for 263,000 jobs in Florida, more than three times the actual workforce at Walt Disney World, according to the study conducted by Oxford Economics and commissioned by Disney, covering fiscal year 2022. Besides direct employment and spending, the study attributed the company\u2019s multibillion-dollar impact to indirect influences, such as supply chain and employees\u2019 spending.\nThe jobs include Disney employees as well as jobs supported by visitor spending off Disney World property. Disney employs 82,000 workers in Florida, not only at Disney World outside Orlando, but also Disney Cruise Line in Port Canaveral, Fort Lauderdale and Miami, as well as a resort in Vero Beach.\nIn central Florida, Disney directly accounts for 1 in 8 jobs, and for every direct job, another 1.7 jobs are supported across Florida, Oxford Economics said.\nThe time period in the study is before the takeover earlier this year of Disney World's governing district by DeSantis and his appointees after Disney publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\nDisney officials in the past year have said the company plans to invest an additional $17 billion over the next decade in central Florida, including potentially adding another 13,000 jobs. However, the company has shown a willingness to pull back investing in the Sunshine State. Earlier this year, Disney scrapped plans to relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development, an investment estimated at $1 billion.\nDisney World already has four theme parks, more than 25 hotels, two water parks and a shopping and dining district on 25,000 acres (10,117 hectares).\nDisney is battling DeSantis and his appointees in federal and state courts over the takeover of what was formally called the Reedy Creek Improvement District but was renamed the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District after DeSantis appointees gained control. The district was created by the Florida Legislature in 1967 to handle municipal services like firefighting, road repairs and waste hauling, and it was controlled by Disney supporters until earlier this year.\nBefore control of the district changed hands from Disney allies to DeSantis appointees, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees said the \u201celeventh-hour deals\u201d neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided. Disney has filed counterclaims, which include asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable.\nDisney also has sued DeSantis, a state agency and DeSantis appointees on the district's board in federal court in Tallahassee, saying the company's free speech rights were violated when the governor and Republican lawmakers targeted it for expressing opposition to the law dubbed \u201cDon't Say Gay\u201d by its critics.\nIn an earnings report last week, Disney noted that while its theme parks worldwide had a year-to-year increase in operating income, it had decreased at the Florida theme park resort due to costs related to the closure of its immersive Star Wars-themed two-night experience and lower visitor spending from a decrease in hotel rates.\n___\nFollow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP.",

Britain too has seen a jump in enquiries about the pests.\nIn South Korea, about 30 cases of suspected infestations have been reported nationwide, including at a traditional Korean spa called \"jjimjilbang\" in Incheon, west of Seoul, and a college dorm in the southeastern city of Daegu, officials said.\nThe prime minister's office on Tuesday launched a four-week campaign with inspections of public facilities and pest control measures.\n\"Public anxiety is inevitable as reports continue to come in,\" Park Ku-yeon, first deputy chief of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, who heads the team in change of the campaign, told a meeting.\nPark singled out small dorm rooms known as \"gosiwon\" and single-room households as most vulnerable, calling for support from district authorities.\nThe wingless insects hide in mattresses and bedding and feed on blood, typically biting at night.\nSouth Korea's hotel and tour industry is stepping up vigilance with distribution of repellent and training for staff.\nLotte Hotels and Resorts, a hospitality arm of Lotte Corp , said it had not found any infestations but issued guidelines to all branches and it plans to disinfect bedding, mattresses, carpets and sofas.\n\"We're trying to take strong precautionary steps,\" a Lotte Hotel official told Reuters.\nAuthorities in the capital, Seoul, said metro operators would disinfect trains more frequently and gradually replace fabric seats with plastic ones.\nDrivers have to disinfect their taxis twice a day and control measures are also being implemented on buses.

A spokeswoman for Garantex, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in April last year, said the company welcomed initiatives \"to fight cybercrime around the world\" and encouraged Elliptic and others to share information about the hackers' finances, saying suspicious funds would be blocked.\nElliptic co-founder Tom Robinson said the massive haul made Black Basta \"one of the most profitable ransomware strains of all time.\" He said the researchers came up with the figure by identifying known ransom payments tied to the group and tracing how the digital currency was laundered, which revealed additional payments.\nRobert McArdle, a cybercrime expert with security firm TrendMicro who was not involved in the report, said the Black Basta figure was \"certainly in a believable range for their operations.\"\nThe Elliptic-Corvus report said it had also uncovered evidence tying Black Basta to the defunct Russian group \"Conti.\"\nConti used to be among the top ransomware gangs - operators that shook down victims either by encrypting their data and demanding money to unscramble it, by threatening to publish stolen information to the web, or both.\nThe Russia-based group dismantled its leak site after the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 and the posting of U.S. bounties on its leadership that year but researchers have long suspected that the group merely reorganized and rebranded.\n\"Conti was perhaps the most successful ransomware gang we've seen,\" Robinson said. The latest findings suggest that \"some of the individuals responsible are replicating its success with the Black Basta ransomware,\" he added.\n(Reporting by Raphael Satter; Additional reporting by James Pearson in London; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Richard Chang and Mark Porter)",

That followed an announcement by DNB that it intends to redeem the notes by the end of February.\nThe decision is a surprise twist in a long-standing saga that pitted investors against the bank. DNB wanted to keep the bonds as a cheap source of money, betting on a potential rule by the Norwegian finance ministry to create a place in its capital structure for this obsolete type of debt. Instead, bondholders look set for a windfall given they were trading at a deep discount.\nThe perpetual notes were sold back in the mid-1980s as a source of regulatory capital. After multiple changes in bank regulations over the years, they lost this status, but wafer-thin spreads made them attractive to hold on to. The bank\u2019s management repeatedly stated its commitment to keeping them outstanding.\nThe move \u201cwill delight bondholders,\u201d wrote Jennifer Ray, head of northern European banks at credit research firm CreditSights, Inc., in a note. \u201cThe expected amendment to Norwegian law previously relied upon in DNB\u2019s original decision not to redeem the instruments will not now go ahead.\u201d\nThor Tellefsen, head of long term funding at DNB, declined to comment.\nEarlier this year, DNB launched a vote to change the rate used on the bonds to calculate interest from the now-dead Libor to a replacement rate. Investors, who had been grappling with a lack of clarity on where these junior bonds sit if the bank failed, rejected it.\nThe price of a similar bond by BNP Paribas SA, which has also remained outstanding over four decades, jumped 1.5 cent on the dollar to about 94 cents after the DNB announcement, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.\n(Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph, bond move in eighth.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nWhy America\u2019s Wind Power Failures Are Good for GE\nNo One Told AI Startups That San Francisco Is Over\nPeter Thiel Is Still Hoping That Donald Trump Just Fades Away\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased by nearly 0.2% or close to 60 points.\nRecent signs of a weaker US economy signaled to the market that the Fed could ease up on its rate hikes. But central bankers have said that the door is still open to additional increases, even if officials decide to pause for a time.\nAnd while the market's momentum has swung to a more optimistic reading, investors have plenty of cautious voices to check their exuberance, including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who emphasized both Monday and Tuesday that the central bank likely has more work ahead of it to control inflation. Kashkari was one of several more hawkish members of the Fed to express caution on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak later in the week.\nRead more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\"There was quite a bit of euphoria at the end of last week on the belief that the Fed is done, the jobs market is slowing, that the US economy is going to experience a soft landing,\" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, told Reuters. \"People have started to become a bit more clear-eyed. There is the risk that the Fed could rise again.\"\nThe fresh Fed doubts clouded the outlook for oil, helping push WTI crude prices below $80 a barrel for the first time in over two months despite the prospect of Saudi and Russian supply cuts. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) and Brent crude futures (BZ=F) both sank 4%, to $77.48 and $81.76 a barrel, respectively.\nAlso dragging on oil was trade data showing China's drop in exports unexpectedly accelerated in October, a sign of flagging overseas demand, while its imports rose. But there was a bright spot for the world's second-biggest economy, as the IMF upgraded its GDP growth forecasts for the country this year and next.\nIn corporate news, WeWork (WE) on Monday filed for bankruptcy after the once most valuable US startup grappled with expensive leases. Its shares have fallen about 98% this year.\nMeanwhile, earnings season continues with reports from Uber (UBER) and Rivian (RIVN) highlighting Tuesday's docket, ahead of the closely watched Disney (DIS) results due Wednesday.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) increased for the seventh consecutive session, extending a win streak as investors banked on the Federal Reserve holding rates steady heading into the end of the year. The S&P rose by nearly 0.3%\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.9%, notching its eighth straight day of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.17% or almost 60 points.\nWall Street has been skeptical about how much Disney (DIS) can charge for a new ESPN streaming service it's planning to launch. But the company's former streaming chief says sports fans will be willing to pay \u2014 even if the price tag is higher than what most platforms currently cost.\n\"People have always paid a lot for sports,\" Kevin Mayer, who now runs Blackstone-backed entertainment startup Candle Media, said at the Yahoo Finance Invest Conference on Tuesday. \"They didn't always know it because back in the day when 95% of this country had paid TV bundles, probably 40% to 50% of the cost of that bundle was sports programming. ... [But] now they can do so explicitly.\"\nHis comments come as Disney's stock has hit multiyear lows and activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing for multiple board seats at the company. The company's parks business is slowing, its linear TV division is declining, and its streaming business is not yet profitable.\nMayer, who is currently serving as a strategic adviser to CEO Bob Iger, said his former boss is \"definitely most focused on making sure that ESPN, a company that he really believes in strongly, is well positioned for the future.\"\nDisney hasn\u2019t disclosed any details regarding pricing for the ESPN service, although analysts have estimated it would need to cost a minimum of around $30 a month in order to break even \u2014 let alone turn a profit.\nMayer, however, insisted that $30 a month is an \"entirely reasonable price to get the full suite of sports that ESPN would offer.\"\nRead more here.\nA substantial drop in inflation that comes without triggering a recession is still a possibility, said Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee.\n\"Over the next couple of months, we might equal the fastest drop in inflation in the last century,\" Goolsbee said Tuesday, during in an interview with CNBC. \"So we're making progress on the inflation rate.\"\nGoolsbee noted that in previous battles against inflation a recession usually followed when central bankers had to greatly reduce pricing pressures. But achieving a soft landing in this tightening cycle would achieve what has not previously been done, he said, because of the magnitude of the inflation drop that would be required.\nHe also noted that if the Fed continues to make progress on the inflation front, the debate will shift from whether to rise rates to how long to keep rates elevated.\nCredit card balances rose by $48 billion in the third quarter to a record high of $1.08 trillion, according to data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The $154 billion year-over-year gain in debt was the largest such increase since the beginning of the series in 1999. At the same time, the 90-day delinquency rate measure for credit cardholders increased to 5.78%, up from 3.69% a year earlier, Yahoo Finance's Gabriella Cruz-Martinez reports.\nRising delinquencies spanned incomes and regions, the data showed, but they were particularly acute among millennials and those with auto or student loans.\nThe fresh data comes as the three-year federal student loan payment pause ended in October and interest rates on credit cards have increased to 38-year highs. The combination has been a blow to some borrowers saddled with credit card debt.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page in afternoon trading on Tuesday:\nIntel (INTC): Shares of the multinational tech company rose 2% Tuesday afternoon following a report from the Wall Street Journal that revealed the company is in the running to potentially receive billions of dollars in government funding for secure facilities producing microchips for US military and intelligence applications.\nARM (ARM): Arm shares rose by more than 3% following reports that Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) are both planning to launch Arm-based central processing units (CPUs) for Windows-based PCs.\nDatadog (DDOG): Shares surged nearly 30% Tuesday afternoon after the security software company beat profit expectations and delivered a positive outlook as more customers transition to the cloud seeking more robust security solutions amid heightened cybersecurity threats.\nPlanet Fitness: (PLNT): Shares of the gym chain climbed more than 12% Tuesday after reporting a nearly 14% increase in total revenue from last year on growth in same-store sales and more than two dozen new clubs.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on track to notch its seventh consecutive day of wins, if it holds on to its gains through the closing bell. The index rose 0.2% in afternoon trading.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by about 0.7%, on target to record its eighth straight day of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just over the flatline.\nStrong showings from corporate America are generally moving stocks upward again.\nThe 710 companies that reported quarterly results last week saw a 2.3% gain in the trading session following their release, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That's one of the best readings in the last 20 years, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports.\nBut it's not the earnings themselves that have changed investor behavior, but rather the shifting narrative that has renewed hopes on Wall Street that the Fed is close to ending its rate hiking campaign.\nAs the current market consensus has shifted over the past several trading sessions, investors appear less worried about the headwinds that drove stocks lower in October. As of late-morning Tuesday, markets were pricing in a 90% chance the Fed holds interest rates steady in December, up significantly from the roughly 58% chance seen a month ago.\nAnthony Capuano, the chief executive of Marriott, said the hotel chain is dedicated to the Middle East market, even as the conflict in Israel and Gaza carries the potential for broader regional instability. \"We've got a robust pipeline across the region,\" Capuano said during a live interview at Yahoo Finance Invest, adding that keeping guests within the hotel ecosystem is a top priority. Marriott has more than two dozen hotels in Lebanon and Egypt.\nCapuano also emphasized the company's growth in China, its second-largest market. The operating environment there, he said, \"is more than fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\" Marriott recently opened its 500th hotel in China, he said, and has plans to open another 400 properties.\nWhile the US and China are grappling with heightened economic and national security tensions, Capuano said his company has been able to stay above the geopolitical fray because Marriott is an asset-light business.\nOf the 500 hotels in Marriott's China portfolio and the hundreds more on the way, most of the properties are \"almost entirely China-owned,\" he said.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page in morning trading on Tuesday:\nDatadog (DDOG): Shares surged 24% Tuesday morning after the security software company beat profit expectations and delivered a positive outlook as more customers transition to the cloud seeking more robust security solutions amid heightened cybersecurity threats.\nPlanet Fitness: (PLNT): Shares of the gym chain climbed more than 15% Tuesday after reporting a nearly 14% increase in total revenue from last year on growth in same-store sales and more than two dozen new clubs.\nWeWork (WORK): Trading on the co-working space provider remains halted as the former high-flying startup is expected to file for bankruptcy after its value plunged from $50 billion. The company warned investors in August that its financial troubles may force the company to shutter, punctuating what has been a disastrous run as a public company. It's last price was below $1.\nPeloton (PTON): The troubled connected fitness company edged up less than 1% Tuesday morning after investors sent the company down more than 5% in premarket trading. The rollercoaster moves came after Deutsche Bank downgraded Peloton to Hold from Buy as it sought clarity on its growth outlook.\nWall Street couldn't keep up the surge that fueled last week's rally, as pessimism over the potential for future rate hikes overtook hopes of an end to the Fed's tightening campaign.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by about 0.3%, continuing on a win-streak path, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged down by 0.06%.

        "text": "\nThe removal of contaminated soil from the eastern Ohio site of February's fiery Norfolk Southern derailment is expected to be completed sometime this weekend, although the larger cleanup effort isn't over.\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials and the railroad announced the milestone Thursday in East Palestine. It comes nearly nine months after the derailment forced thousands from their homes near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Area residents still have lingering fears about potential health effects from the assortment of toxic chemicals that spilled, and the vinyl chloride that was released a few days after the crash to keep five tank cars from exploding.\nThe derailment has inspired nationwide worries about railroad safety and prompted members of Congress and regulators to propose reforms, however that bill has largely stalled.\nSince the Feb. 3 derailment, the railroad has removed more than 167,000 tons of contaminated soil and more than 39 million gallons of tainted water from the site where hazardous materials spilled and were released from tank cars.\nThe end of the soil removal will significantly cut down on heavy truck traffic in East Palestine. Officials were also able to reopen Taggart Street to the public near the derailment site this week.\nOfficials with both the state and federal Environmental Protection Agencies will still oversee the remaining cleanup work, which includes backfilling in excavated areas and assessing chemical contamination in the area's creeks. Residents post pictures regularly of a chemical sheen on water in the streams anytime the creekbed is disturbed.\nRegional EPA administrator Debra Shore promised that her agency will make sure all the contamination is gone before signing off on the cleanup.\nThe railroad's CEO Alan Shaw also promised to see the cleanup through.\n\u201cNorfolk Southern is committed to remaining in East Palestine for the long haul,\u201d Shaw said.\nRegular testing of the air and water will still take place too. Officials have said those tests consistently showed it's safe although many residents remain uneasy.\nNorfolk Southern said earlier this week that the costs associated with the derailment have grown to nearly $1 billion, a figure that will keep climbing as more legal settlements and fines are agreed to and the cleanup carries on. That total includes more than $96 million the railroad has pledged to residents and the community to help them recover.",

That was expanded to all ports on Friday at 12 a.m. (1100 GMT)\nA spokesperson from the union Transport, which counts the dockworkers as its members, said that Swedish ports often saw one to three shipments of Tesla cars a week, but no shipments had arrived since the start of the strike.\n\"So the blockade is working,\" the spokesperson said.\nU.S.-based Tesla, which has revolutionised the electric car market, has managed to avoid collective bargaining agreements, which cover wages and conditions, with its roughly 127,000 workers and Musk has been vocal about his opposition to unions.\nMarie Nilsson, head of IF Metall, told Reuters on Friday that the union had received some indications early on in the dispute that Tesla was engaging in strike-breaking tactics by flying in workers from other countries.\n\"We have never experienced anything like this before... we haven't dealt with this in Sweden since 1937 or so,\" Nilsson says.\n\"And this has forced us to escalate the conflict,\" she added.\nIf Sweden can break Tesla's resistance, that could provide a precedent for other countries.\nSo far, unions in the United States and Germany have failed to force the carmaker to accept collective bargaining agreements.\n\"If they have come to Sweden, they must follow the rules. We have certain norms here and he (Musk) must accept them,\" Torbjorn Johansson, negotiation secretary at Sweden's LO labour confederation, said.\n\"Swedish workers cannot afford to lose this fight.\"\nSwedish unions have achieved success before getting foreign firms to accept local industrial practices.\nIn the 1990s, American toy company Toys \"R\" Us signed a collective bargaining agreement with its 130 Swedish employees after a three-month strike.\nNilsson said IF Metall had no plans to stop the strike action anytime soon.\n\"As long as it is needed,\" she said.\nIn addition to dockworkers, unionised cleaners are refusing to clean Tesla buildings and postal workers have stopped delivering mail.\nOn Friday, electricians stopped service and repair work for Tesla, including at its charging stations across Sweden.\nSwedish workers are also supported by Norway's Fellesforbundet, the biggest union in the country's LO confederation.\nAction against Tesla in Sweden is due to escalate further - if no agreement is reached - on Nov. 24 when about 50 unionised workers at Hydro Extrusions, a subsidiary of Norwegian aluminium and energy company Hydro, will stop work on Tesla car products.\nTesla has not responded to repeated requests for comment.

Thursday's economic data suggested that the Federal Reserve is likely done raising interest rates and may start easing by the middle of next year, typically a dollar-negative factor. Euro weakness after a soft euro zone inflation report also partly helped boost the greenback, analysts said. The dollar index, which measures its value against six major currencies, rose 0.6% to 103.38 and was on track to post its best daily gain in more than a month. On a monthly basis, the dollar has posted a 3% loss, on pace for its worst monthly showing in a year. Some analysts said the dollar may have benefited from month-end demand, as investors squared up positions for November, a period that featured a sharp sell-off in the U.S. currency with the market pricing in rate cuts next year. Others, however, expected a dollar sell-off at month-end with stocks' sharp gains for November. There were sell dollar signals at some of the biggest U.S. banks, analysts said. \"We were expecting dollar selling at month-end given how much U.S. equities rallied. That typically means foreign asset managers would have sold dollars forward,\" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist, at UBS in New York. \"But it's possible that some of the selling happened earlier in the month. So maybe there's less dollar selling at month end.\" Dollar gains persisted despite reports that showed U.S. inflation continued to moderate in October and jobless claims rose in the latest week suggesting a slowing labor market. Inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was unchanged in October after climbing 0.4% in September. In the 12 months through October, the PCE price index increased 3.0%. That was the smallest year-on-year gain since March 2021 and followed a 3.4% advance in September. Meanwhile, initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 218,000 for the week ended Nov. 25. Economists had forecast 226,000 claims. In other currencies, the euro fell after euro zone inflation eased by more than forecast this month, fuelling bets of early European Central Bank rate cuts. Consumer price growth in the 20 countries that share the euro currency dropped to 2.4% in November from 2.9% in October, well below expectations for a fall to 2.7%. The euro last changed hands at $1.0889 against the dollar, down 0.7%. It is still poised to show a monthly gain of 3%, the largest since November 2022. Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.7% to 148.20 yen. For November, the greenback was down 2.3%, on pace for its largest monthly fall since December last year. \"The broader picture is that the dollar has weakened quite substantially in November. It's still probably a two-way risk from here in terms of the Fed December meeting,\" Serebriakov of UBS said. \"The U.S. data hasn't slowed significantly. Inflation has but activity data remains relatively resilient,\" he added. U.S. rate futures have priced in about a 47% chance of a rate cut at the March 19-20, 2024 meeting, rising to about 78% probability at the April 30-May 1 meeting, the CME FedWatch Tool showed on Thursday. Overall, the rates market sees roughly 100 basis points (bps) of cuts by the end of 2024, according to LSEG data. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 4:30PM (2130 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Dollar index 103.4800 102.8200 +0.66% -0.010% +103.5900 +102.7100 Euro/Dollar $1.0887 $1.0969 -0.75% +1.61% +$1.0984 +$1.0879 Dollar/Yen 148.1800 147.2400 +0.64% +13.02% +148.5000 +146.8500 Euro/Yen 161.34 161.51 -0.11% +15.00% +161.9400 +160.6000 Dollar/Swiss 0.8753 0.8737 +0.19% -5.33% +0.8770 +0.8681 Sterling/Dollar $1.2625 $1.2695 -0.55% +4.40% +$1.2710 +$1.2604 Dollar/Canadian 1.3564 1.3589 -0.18% +0.11% +1.3626 +1.3553 Aussie/Dollar $0.6607 $0.6617 -0.14% -3.07% +$0.6650 +$0.6571 Euro/Swiss 0.9529 0.9585 -0.58% -3.70% +0.9590 +0.9474 Euro/Sterling 0.8621 0.8640 -0.22% -2.52% +0.8649 +0.8615 NZ $0.6155 $0.6156 +0.00% -3.05% +$0.6182 +$0.6123 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway 10.8050 10.6310 +1.84% +10.32% +10.8240 +10.6690 Euro/Norway 11.7625 11.6879 +0.64% +12.09% +11.7848 +11.6717 Dollar/Sweden 10.4919 10.3624 +0.59% +0.81% +10.5397 +10.3450 Euro/Sweden 11.4228 11.3560 +0.59% +2.45% +11.4840 +11.3576 (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Samuel Indyk in London; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Alexander Smith and Deepa Babington)",

Meijer\nLUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -An EU tribunal made legal errors when it ruled in favour of Apple over a 13-billion-euro ($14 billion) tax order and should review the case again, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday, in a potential setback for the iPhone maker.\nThe tax case against Apple was part of EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's crackdown against deals between multinationals and EU countries that regulators saw as unfair state aid.\nThe European Commission in its 2016 decision said Apple benefited from two Irish tax rulings for more than two decades that artificially reduced its tax burden to as low as 0.005% in 2014.\nThe European Union's General Court in 2020 upheld Apple's challenge, saying that regulators had not met the legal standard to show Apple had enjoyed an unfair advantage.\nBut advocate General Giovanni Pitruzzella at the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) disagreed, saying CJEU judges should set aside the General Court ruling and refer the case back to the lower tribunal.\n\"The judgment of the General Court on 'tax rulings' adopted by Ireland in relation to Apple should be set aside,\" he said in a non-binding opinion.\nHe said the General Court committed a series of errors in law and had also failed \"to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors that, according to the Commission decision, vitiated the tax rulings\".\n\"It is therefore necessary for the General Court to carry out a new assessment,\" Pitruzzella said.\nThe CJEU, which will rule in the coming months, follows around four in five such recommendations.\nIreland reiterated that it had not provided any state aid to Apple.\n\"It is important to bear in mind that this opinion does not form part of the Court of Justice of the European Union judgment but is considered by the Court when arriving at its final ruling,\" Michael McGrath said in a statement.\n\"It has always been, and remains, Ireland's position that the correct amount of Irish tax was paid and that Ireland provided no state aid to Apple.\"\nWhile Apple and Dublin appealed against the tax order, Apple nevertheless had to hand over the full amount, which Ireland has been holding in an escrow account.\nThe Irish government has long said that even if it loses the its appeal and gets to keep the money, other EU member states will make claims that they are owed some of the back taxes.\n\"We thank the court for its time and ongoing consideration in this case. The General Court\u2019s ruling was very clear that Apple received no selective advantage and no state aid, and we believe that should be upheld,\" an Apple spokesperson said.\nVestager has had a mixed record defending her tax cases in court, with judges backing challenges by automaker Stellantis, Amazon and Starbucks.\nHer biggest legal victory to date came in September when the General Court upheld her decision against a 700-million-euro Belgian tax scheme for 55 multinationals. Her tax crackdown has forced EU countries to scrap such sweetheart deals.\nVestager is currently investigating IKEA brand owner Inter IKEA's Dutch tax arrangement in a case dating from 2017, Nike's Dutch tax rulings and Finnish food and drink packaging company Huhtamaki's tax rulings granted by Luxembourg.\nThe Apple case is C-465/20 P Commission v Ireland and Others.\n($1 = 0.9346 euros)",

(AP) \u2014 Daryl Hall has sued his longtime music partner John Oates, arguing that his plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged.\nThe move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale while legal proceedings and a previously initiated arbitration continue.\nA Nashville chancery court judge issued the temporary restraining order on Nov. 16, writing that Oates and others involved in his trust can't move to close the sale of their share of Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave IP Investment Management LLC until an arbitrator in a separately filed case weighs in on the deal, or until the judge's order expires \u2014 typically within 15 days, unless a judge extends the deadline.\nChancellor Russell Perkins issued the order the same day Hall filed his lawsuit, which was largely brought forth under seal, obscuring most details. An order Wednesday by the judge allowed more filings to be made public, though many details about the pair's business agreement and the proposed sale remain under wraps.\nWriting in favor of sealing certain filings, Hall's attorneys reasoned that it's a private dispute under an agreement with confidential terms, concerning a confidential arbitration process.\nAlthough the publicly released version of the lawsuit didn\u2019t specify what\u2019s at stake in the sale, Primary Wave has already owned \u201csignificant interest\u201d in Hall and Oates\u2019 song catalog for more than 15 years. In a 2021 interview with Sky News, Hall alluded to disappointment with the sale of his back catalog.\n\u201cOh, in the early days, it got sold off for me and I didn\u2019t get the money,\u201d he said. In the same interview, he advised artists to retain their publishing rights, saying \u201call you have is that.\u201d\nThe lawsuit contends that Hall opened an arbitration process on Nov. 9 against Oates and the other defendants in the lawsuit, Oates' wife, Aimee Oates, and Richard Flynn, in their roles as co-trustees of Oates' trust. Hall was seeking an order preventing them from selling their part in Whole Oats Enterprises to Primary Wave Music.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Oates' team intimated at the time that the sale could close within days, although no arbitrator had been picked yet to sort through the conflict.\nThe lawsuit says Oates' team entered into a letter of intent with Primary Wave Music for the sale, and alleges further that the letter makes clear that the music duo's business agreement was disclosed to Primary Wave Music in violation of a confidentiality provision.\n\u201cThus, the entire Unauthorized Transaction is the product of an indisputable breach of contract,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nThe case will be taken up at a Nov. 30 court hearing.\nThe Associated Press sent emails to attorneys for both parties and to representatives for Primary Wave Music on Friday. Still unclear is whether the dispute centers on the music catalog of Hall & Oates, a soft-rock-and-pop duo best known for its No. 1 hits \u201cPrivate Eyes,\u201d \u201cRich Girl\u201d and \u201cManeater.\"\nDaryl Hall and John Oates got their start as Temple University students before signing with Atlantic Records in 1972. In the decades since, they have achieved six platinum albums and many more Top 10 singles with their unique approach to blue-eyed soul. Hall & Oates was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 and its latest album, \u201cHome for Christmas,\u201d was released in 2006. The duo continued to perform as of last year.\n\u201cWe have this incredibly good problem of having so many hits,\u201d Oates told the AP in 2021, just before resuming a national tour that had been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s not a chore to play those songs because they are really great.\u201d\n___\nSherman reported from Copperas Cove, Texas.",

The report states that allergic diseases such as asthma are a growing concern in the U.S. cannabis industry, which has grown rapidly in recent years thanks to a wave of state-level legalizations.\nThe report said the worker's death \u201cillustrates missed opportunities for prevention, including workplace exposures, medical surveillance, and treatment according to the current asthma guidelines.\u201d\nThe report also states that evaluation of workers with new-onset or worsening asthma is essential in cannabis facilities. That approach could help prevent workplace deaths when paired \u201cwith prompt diagnosis and medical management,\u201d the report states.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the report, which it said represented findings of a federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspection that included a worksite exposure assessment, coworker and next-of-kin interviews, medical record reviews, and collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\nThe report does not name the worker or the Massachusetts facility. However, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration reported in filings last year that an employee at the Holyoke location of cannabis company Trulieve who was packaging ground cannabis into pre-rolls suffered an asthma attack and later died in the hospital. Trulieve identified the worker as Lorna McMurrey, 27, last year.\nRepresentatives for Trulieve did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\nThe report cites studies that identify respiratory hazards in the cannabis cultivation and production industry, such as microbial and plant allergens. The report also states that chemicals such as pesticides and allergens specific to the cannabis plant itself can be a hazard.\nThe finding comes as legalization of recreational marijuana, and the resultant growth of the cannabis industry, is spreading. Almost half the states allow adult recreational use of marijuana. Legalizations began in 2012 with Washington and Colorado and have only accelerated.\nAdvocates for safety in the marijuana industry have called for more safeguards to make sure the cannabis business doesn\u2019t put workers or the public at risk.\nThe death of the Massachusetts worker \u201cshould be a big red flag to lawmakers that we need to put way more guardrails around that industry,\u201d said Scott Gagnon, a cannabis industry watchdog who advocates for the prevention of substance abuse in Maine, where marijuana has been legal for several years.\nThe industry wants to be as safe as possible, said Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, the marijuana law reform group, adding that \u201clikelihood of such incidences is greatly reduced in environments where cannabis businesses are licensed, regulated, and required to adhere to the same sort of workplace safety regulations and standards as others.\"\n\u201cFurthermore, when such incidences do occur, the regulated marketplace ensures that they are properly investigated and that corrective actions are taken to prevent future incidents,\u201d Armentano said.",

The U.S. will also work to expand its contributions to the bank, one of the officials said.\nThe new IDB financing platform is part of a package that will also include funds from the private sector and other donors \"to reinforce this welcoming spirit in the region,\" the senior official said. The hope is to expand economic prospects in the region so migrants do not head to the U.S.\n\"We are talking about building competitive regional supply chains that can compete in the market, and that means competing against China,\" one senior U.S. official said, adding that better economies at home could reduce migration outflows.\nClean energy, semiconductors and medical supplies were areas where the region could compete globally, a second official said, adding that increased cooperation efforts could also help Latin America bolster work in space, an area where it has lagged.\nPartner countries could also advance the use of innovative new instruments such as Colombia's green bonds, or the recent debt for climate swap set up for Ecuador by the U.S. International Development Finance Corp, the official said.\nBiden, a Democrat, has grappled with record numbers of migrants crossing the southwest border, fueling criticism from Republicans and some Democratic mayors who say their cities are struggling to provide housing and food.\nMayors of Chicago, Denver, Houston, New York and Los Angeles this week wrote to Biden seeking a meeting and more federal funding, faster access to work permits for migrants and improved coordination, according to a copy reviewed by Reuters.\nBiden has sought to pair restrictive measures to deter illegal border crossings with new legal avenues to the U.S.\nIn mid-October, the administration resumed direct deportations to Venezuela that were stalled for years due to tensions between the two nations. At the same time, the U.S. admitted three Venezuelan families as refugees through a new migrant processing office in Colombia, the senior official said.\nBecause the families arrived through the U.S. refugee resettlement program, they will have a path to U.S. citizenship and receive other benefits not available for those crossing the border illegally, the official said.\nThe administration aims to scale up processing through Safe Mobility Offices, centers that have also opened in Guatemala, Costa Rica and Ecuador. It remained unclear whether those measures and others will reduce record migration levels.\nThe Biden administration has called on the U.S. Congress to provide additional funds for border security, including money to pay other countries to deport migrants. Panama has expressed interest in expanding migrant screening and deportations if funds become available, the official said.

        "text": "\nBy Lisa Baertlein and Priyamvada C\n(Reuters) -United Parcel Service cut its 2023 revenue forecast for the second straight quarter on Thursday as delivery demand continued to soften ahead of the key holiday season, and its shares sank 5% to the lowest level in about three years.\nThe world's biggest package delivery firm is caught in a profit squeeze as it also battles to win back business lost during the summer's tumultuous U.S. labor talks, and to offset higher costs from the resulting five-year deal covering 340,000 Teamsters-represented workers in the United States.\n\"We expected conditions in the third quarter to be challenging, and they were,\" CEO Carol Tome said on a conference call.\nThe year-end holiday season is the busiest period for package delivery companies. UPS customers include retailers like Amazon.com, Walmart and Macy's, which are bracing for U.S. holiday sales that some analysts forecast could be the slowest since 2018.\nRetail reported the biggest package volume decline in the third quarter, when all industry sectors retreated, UPS executives said.\nUPS now expects U.S. package volume to be down in the low- to mid-single-digit percentages by December. It previously forecast flatish year-over-year volume by year end.\n\"It's weak, there's no way around it,\" said Jefferies analyst Stephanie Moore, who attributed the company's tempered outlook to market forces rather than unique UPS challenges.\nShares of rival FedEx also fell, declining 4% in midday trading.\nUPS, seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy, cut its full-year revenue forecast to $91.3 billion to $92.3 billion, down from its prior forecast of around $93 billion.\nThe company also reduced its projection for annual adjusted operating margin to between 10.8% and 11.3% versus 11.8% previously.\nSome of the margin pressure comes from customers shifting to less lucrative ground-based delivery from faster and more profitable air-based services. E-commerce leader Amazon.com, the biggest UPS customer, is leading that trend, executives said.\nThe entire package delivery industry is fighting for market share as the pool of potential e-commerce deliveries shrinks. Reuters reported earlier this month that UPS and its rivals for the first time in years have been using discounts and other incentives to maintain and win market share, moves that could further pressure sector profits.\nUPS said labor negotiations-related package diversions continued into the third quarter. It revised the total to 1.5 million average daily packages, up from 1.2 million previously.\nThus far, it has recouped 600,000 of those packages, with Amazon accounting for half of that regained business, executives said.\nMeanwhile, UPS is investing with an eye on future growth.\nThe Atlanta-based company this quarter will spend more than $1 billion on healthcare specialist MNX Global Logistics and returns specialist Happy Returns to bolster package volumes, CEO Tome said.\nUPS also has been cutting jobs, parking planes and leaning on package tracking and other technology to help offset falling e-commerce demand, weak export and industrial production and the cost hit from its new labor contract.\nThe company posted an adjusted profit of $1.57 per share in the quarter, topping analysts estimates by 5 cents, according to LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Priyamvada C and Lisa Baertlein; Editing by Arun Koyyur, David Holmes and Bill Berkrot)",

It said the path to avoid a recession had narrowed, while leaving the door open to more rate hikes to tame inflation that could exceed its target for another two years.\n\"It was pretty much consensus that it would be this hawkish type hold because inflation has been stubborn to come down,\" said Tom O'Gorman, director of fixed income at Franklin Templeton Canada.\n\"Eventually, we're getting to that point where the rate hikes, they're going to bite the economy and you are probably going to be close to a recession or recession-like type of growth.\"\nMoney markets see a 44% chance of another rate hike over the coming months, down from roughly 60% before the rate decision.\nThe loonie was trading 0.4% lower at 1.3790 to the greenback, or 72.52 U.S. cents, after touching its weakest since March 15 at 1.3810.\n\"Sagging risk sentiment into the afternoon\" added to pressure on the Canadian currency, said Michael Goshko, senior market analyst at Convera Canada ULC.\nWall Street fell after lackluster corporate results, while the U.S. dollar rallied against a basket of major currencies.\nCanadian government bond yields were higher across a steeper curve but the move for shorter-dated maturities was less than for the equivalent U.S. Treasury yields.\nThe 2-year rose 2.9 basis points to 4.749%, while the 10-year was up 11.3 basis points at 4.131%.

        "text": "\nIf you\u2019re looking to give a gift that keeps on giving this holiday season, you might want to consider stocks or other investments. Your loved one likely won't be disappointed.\nA new Yahoo Finance/Ipsos poll revealed that almost 7 in 10 Americans would be pleased with an investment as a holiday gift. Just 6% said they would be let down by receiving this type of gift.\nStill, an investment as a gift requires careful planning to avoid any tax missteps and ensure that the gift provides the benefits the recipient needs.\n\"When an individual receives securities as a gift, the potential growth is hopeful. It might be something more in the future,\" Erika Safran, founder of Safran Wealth Advisors, told Yahoo Finance. \"Perhaps if an individual comes from a family or low income earners, chances are that that monetary gift will be put to use, pay a bill, pay off a debt, pay for tuition\u2026.But for someone who may not need the money, receiving the securities creates a greater future opportunity.\"\nHere's what to know.\nRead more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide\nSafran recommended that gift givers start by determining what investments best suited their intended recipients.\nInvestments like mutual funds and ETFs are less risky because they are diversified, she said, while stocks come with more risk. Some can be big winners; others, not so much.\n\"One downside,\" she said, \"you may be giving that appreciated security, which, in turn, may turn out to be a dog.\"\nGift givers should be mindful of the gift recipient's investment experience and financial education, Safran said. Those giving a gift should also explain their stock pick to their recipient.\n\"Tell the story: why you bought it, why you own it, what it's done, and how it's invested,\" she said. \"And is this something that you feel comfortable holding on to.\"\nAnother consideration, according to Nicholas Weisert, a financial adviser and chief compliance officer at Integra Financial, is the recipient's tax bracket.\n\"So folks in higher tax brackets, you're likely going to want to skew towards investments that have lower tax ramifications \u2014 your stocks and growth funds, ETFs or mutual funds,\" he said. \"And folks in lower tax brackets, you'd probably prefer them to receive the things that are interest bearing or paying a dividend.\"\nTaxes can make buying an investment gift a little more complicated than purchasing a gift card.\nThe first thing to know is that the maximum amount a gift giver can give another person \u2014 aside from a spouse \u2014 in the 2023 calendar year without reporting it to the IRS is $17,000. Past that point, the gift giver will likely have to fill out tax Form 709 to report the gift.\nThat doesn't mean the gift is taxed, though, experts are quick to point out.\n\"Many confuse the annual gift tax limit of $17,000 as a maximum gift and believe amounts above that are taxable,\" Safran said. \"Though the annual gift tax exclusion is $17,000 per giver to one recipient, it does not mean that amounts above that are taxed. All it means is that this is the maximum amount you can give to one person without filing a tax form to inform the IRS.\"\nGifts above $17,000 also count against the gift giver's lifetime gift exemption. For 2023, gift givers can give a maximum lifetime amount of $12.92 million in cash or other assets to one person before the federal gift tax comes into play. So, that's a lot of wiggle room.\nAnother tax consideration is the cost basis of the investment, Safran said.\nIn a hypothetical, she explained that if the original investment was $10,000 and is now worth $50,000, the gift recipient now owns $50,000 in stock. That gifted stock is also treated as if the recipient bought the stock on the same date as the original owner. So, if the recipient sells the stock immediately, they will need to pay capital gains tax on the $40,000 gain.\nBut whether it is taxed as a long-term or short-term gain depends on when the original owner purchased the stock. If the original owner held it for more than one year, the recipient will pay long-term capital gains tax. But if the owner held the security for less than a year, the gains are taxed as ordinary income. In general, long-term capital gain taxes are lower than ordinary income, so the gift recipient should hold the investment gift longer.\nThe gift giver may also want to think about the best tax situation for them. Selling a stock first and giving the cash instead to the recipient may make more sense if the value of the stock has gone down since it was originally purchased. That's because the gift giver can realize a capital loss that can be used to offset any other capital gains that tax year. If the giver has no gains to offset, they can use the loss to deduct against ordinary income, up to $3,000 per tax year.\nOnce investors have selected the right investment for the recipient and know the tax implications, the most straightforward way to transfer the asset from the owner\u2019s account to the gift recipient is via a brokerage firm. Typically, the owner of the securities signs a document by hand or using DocuSign to transfer the assets.\n\"That's the easiest way of doing it. There are other more complicated ways,\" Safran said. \"You can also transfer it to someone who owns an account at another brokerage firm. But it's a different process. So maybe the bulk of it is yes, you can transfer securities to any brokerage firm. The easiest is though is if the recipient already has an account.\"\nDylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.\nClick here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and more\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

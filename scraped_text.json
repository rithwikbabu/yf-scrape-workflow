        "text": "\n\n(Rewrites story with details on record remittances)\n\nNov 22 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Nicaragua's economy to expand by 4% in 2023 due in large part to record remittances from migrants who have fled the Central American country, the lender said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe IMF also said economic growth would likely continue next year and in the mid-term but at a lower rate than the historical average.\n\nFollowing a mission to the country, the international lender concluded that average inflation would likely fall to 8.9% this year, from 10.5% in 2022, and that the government will maintain a \"small\" budget surplus.\n\n\"Nicaragua's economy has remained resilient in the face of multiple shocks, supported by appropriate economic policies, substantial buffers, and multilateral support,\" according to the statement.\n\nCash transfers, or remittances, from Nicaraguan migrants living abroad are expected to contribute around 28% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023, the IMF added, or double their contribution to the economy just two years ago.\n\nThe influx has been fueled by a \"rapid increase\" in Nicaraguan migration, the IMF statement added.\n\n\"The record-high remittances, coupled with sustained exports, are supporting a turnaround in the current account balance,\" according to the statement, which estimated the anticipated surplus at about 4% of GDP this year.\n\nNicaraguan migration has spiked since mass street protests erupted in Nicaragua five years ago and were met by a harsh response from the government that claimed more than 300 lives, according to rights groups.\n\nSome 900,000 migrants have left the country since then, according to human rights groups, with most seeking better prospects in the United States.\n\nNicaragua's total population stands at about 6 million.

        "text": "\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 The air traffic controller on duty when FedEx and Southwest planes nearly collided earlier this year in Texas told investigators that he expected the airliner to take off more quickly \u2014 before the incoming FedEx plane reached the same runway.\n\nThat is because in his four years working the tower at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, the controller said, Southwest planes usually took off as soon as they got permission.\n\n\u201cBut hindsight being 20/20,\u201d controller Damian Campbell told investigators, he \u201cdefinitely could have held them,\u201d referring to making the Southwest crew wait.\n\nCampbell said in a transcript released Wednesday that he couldn't even see the Southwest plane through the dense early morning fog on Feb. 4. The FedEx pilots spotted it at the last second and aborted their landing.\n\nThe planes missed each other by about 100 feet (30 meters).\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board released transcripts of interviews and other details of its investigation but did not state a probable cause for the harrowing close call. That determination is expected early next year.\n\nThe near-disaster in Austin is the scariest among more than a half-dozen close calls that the NTSB has investigated this year.\n\nThe surge in such incidents prompted the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 which hires air traffic controllers and manages the nation's airspace \u2014 to convene a \u201csafety summit\u201d of aviation industry officials this spring.\n\nA panel of independent experts concluded this month that the FAA needs better staffing, equipment and technology to cope with a surge in serious close calls. The panel said aviation's margin of safety is shrinking.\n\nThe captain of the FedEx plane flying into Austin said he was \u201cirritated\u201d and \u201cperplexed\u201d when the controller cleared Southwest to take off from runway 18-left, the one he was approaching.\n\n\u201cMy initial response was an expletive, like \u2018What\u2019s he doing?'\u201d Hugo Carvajal III told investigators. Still, he assumed that the Southwest plane \u201cwas going to be well down the runway\u201d by the time he touched down.\n\nCarvajal's first officer, Robert Bradeen Jr., estimated they were 100 to 150 feet (30 to 45 meters) above the runway when he saw the Southwest jet \u2014 first a light, then a silhouette of a wing.\n\n\u201cI think I said, 'Go around, go around, go around\u201d to the captain, Bradeen said, meaning pull up and fly away. He used the radio to tell the Southwest crew to abort their takeoff, but they did not.\n\nAsked what saved the day \u2014 special training or something else, Bradeen said, \u201cI think it was more experience and just the combination of luck that I happened to look out (the cockpit window) at the right time.\u201d\n\nAt a recent congressional hearing, the president of the union representing air traffic controllers complained about understaffing and frequent overtime leading to fatigue.\n\nCampbell, a Navy veteran who had been a controller for 13 years at the time of the Austin incident, said he was on a mandatory six-day work week.\n\nAustin-Bergstrom doesn't have the latest technology, called ASDE-X, for tracking planes and vehicles on the ground \u2014 which could have helped prevent the February close call.\n\n\u201cWe had this dense ground fog ... you couldn't see anything,\u201d Campbell told investigators. He couldn't see the Southwest jet from the tower.\n\n\u201cIt became a concern when I didn't hear Southwest's engines\u201d revving for takeoff on a flight to Cancun, Mexico, he said. \u201cAnd at that point, it became a critical issue.\u201d",

That compares to a previous medium-term forecast, which called for annual increases between the mid-20s and low-30s. The Dutch payments company\u2019s US-listed ADRs jumped as much as 37%.\n\nWhile Adyen said its \u201csubstantial long-term opportunity remains unchanged,\u201d it wanted to specify its expectations for the coming three years.\n\nRevising forecast with a third-quarter update is a departure from its customary half-yearly reports and reflects pressure to provide greater clarity on its growth trajectory. It comes after Adyen had shocked the market in August by disclosing its slowest net revenue increase since listing in 2018. Its shares plunged 39% that day, and the shaken confidence has erased \u20ac24.1 billion ($25.8 billion) of its market value since then.\n\nInvestors had demanded more frequent financial communication and a clear blueprint for achieving its growth ambitions, and many questioned whether the medium-term targets need to be reset.\n\nRead More: PayPal Rival Fintech Adyen Faces Investor Confidence Test\n\nIn its business update on Wednesday, Adyen also said it aims to improve earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to above 50% of sales in 2026.

Its 3Q update signaled a scaling back of hiring in 2024, with cost control now more critical as revenue momentum slows.\u201d\n\n\u2014Tomasz Noetzel, BI Banking Analyst\n\nAdyen New Ebitda Margin Realigned to Reality: React\n\n\u201cWith regards to the updated midterm ambition we remain cautious given the wide range of outcomes,\u201d Jefferies International analyst Hannes Leitner said in a note to clients. He said that while the overall targets are \u201clikely more realistic, they still look ambitious.\u201d\n\nIt also outlined plans to update the market more often. Listening to investor feedback, \u201cwe understand that more updates about how the business is developing along the way would helpful,\u201d Adyen Chief Financial Officer Ethan Tandowsky said at the company\u2019s investor day in San Francisco. \u201cWe plan to share quarterly updates in the year ahead at least,\u201d he said.\n\nAdyen, which competes with the likes of Stripe Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc.-owned Braintree, had attributed the sales slowdown in the first half of the year to increasing price competition in North America, its second-largest market. It had said customers there had tightened purse strings and shifted some volumes to cheaper rivals.\n\nNet revenue in the third quarter rose 22% to \u20ac413.6 million and processed volume increased at a similar pace to \u20ac243.1 billion, the Amsterdam-based company said. The firm added 175 employees in the third quarter, saying it is in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of its industry-defying hiring push.\n\n(Updates to add analyst and CFO comments from seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\n\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\n\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\n\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\n\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\n\nSARAJEVO (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal said on Friday it had temporarily halted output at its Bosnia steel plant and at mines that supply it with iron ore due to a drop in demand in the European steel market.\n\nThe company, which produces about 700,000 tonnes of liquid steel annually and employs about 2,200 workers, said the European steel market has cut demand due to a lower steel consumption that begun in 2022 with the war in Ukraine, the spike in energy prices and output costs, as well as inflation.\n\nThe ArcelorMittal plant in the central town of Zenica said that it halted the operation of its High Oven last Saturday and then gradually stopped the output in other drives, after carefully considering all options available.\n\n\"ArcelorMittal Zenica plans to continue with normal operation as soon as demand returns to the level that enables sustainable business,\" it said in a statement to Reuters.\n\n\"Conditions of demand have significantly worsened in the second half of 2023, and there are expectations that this negative cycle will continue led by a continued economic uncertainty resulting from high inflation,\" the statement said.\n\nIt also said that sales quotas have been limited due to the protective regime imposed by the European Union, and that steel makers had to compete with cheaper steel products imported from Turkey.\n\nAt the same time, the concentration of the metal in the iron ore obtained from the Omarska mines that supply the plant has fallen to 47% from 53%, which means that bigger ore quantities must be purchased for the production of the same quantity of the metal, the company said.\n\nIt said that it has also halted the deliveries from the iron ore mines for as long as its output has been suspended. The Omarska mines further to the north, employing about 850 workers, fully depends on the sales of ore to the Zenica plant.\n\nLast month, the worker unions announced a general strike requesting a new bargaining deal but they are pondering to postpone it after the company has halted production.\n\nArcelorMittal said it had increased wages 32% since 2020 because of the inflation.\n\n(Reporting by Daria Sito-Sucic; Editing by David Evans)",

The stock rose about 8.1% on Thursday.\n\n\"At this point of time, I think we've got a lot on our plate and they (First Quantum) are dealing with a difficult situation, so we will focus on our strategy,\" CEO Mark Bristow told Reuters when asked whether Barrick has interest in acquiring First Quantum.\n\nBristow added that the company is growing its copper on its own, repeating a similar stance he took in an August interview with Reuters when he dismissed a June media report that Barrick was in talks with First Quantum on a possible acquisition.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Barrick beat analysts estimates for its quarterly helped by lower cost and high gold prices.\n\nBarrick has been investing in copper as the red metal is poised to play a key role in the transition to a greener economy. But instead of striking deals like its peers, such as BHP Group and Rio Tinto, that have bought copper mines in the past two years, Barrick has focused on investing in its own mines.\n\n\"This is a reinforcement of what I stand for in Barrick... For me, M&A is an ad hoc opportunity to create value. It shouldn't be the core to anyone's strategy,\" he added.\n\nWhen asked if Barrick has offered advise to First Quantum on the Panama situation, Bristow said, \"It's a tough time for any company and I don't want to put my finger in this soup.\"\n\n(Reporting by Divya Rajagopal, Editing by Franklin Paul and Marguerita Choy)",

        "text": "\nBy Bianca Flowers and Lisa Baertlein\n(Reuters) - The tentative agreements reached between the United Auto Workers and the Detroit Three automakers mark another major victory for labor unions that have turned up the pressure on big corporations to put better deals on the table.\nUnions have taken an aggressive approach to campaigning with a series of high-profile battles across the industrial, auto, entertainment and healthcare industries. Experts say gains won by unions could spur more organizing and motivate non-unionized companies to try to stave off those efforts.\nThe UAW's talks, replete with weekly addresses by union President Shawn Fain, were among the most unabashed. The union came to tentative agreements with Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis in recent days, followed by General Motors early Monday.\n\"This is a set of negotiations, historically, where gains made in Detroit would be viewed and adapted by many other industries across the economy,\" said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California, Berkley.\nUnion worker compensation has finally caught up to non-union wage increases dating from the COVID-19 pandemic, according to U.S. federal data, as the labor market has remained tight with unemployment at just 3.8%.\nThe tentative deals are expected to amount to total pay hikes of more than 33% when compounding and cost-of-living increases are factored in. The agreements may be a selling point for non-union shops to push for unionization, said San Francisco State University labor and employment professor John Logan.\n\"The Big Three would want the UAW to organize Tesla,\" he added.\nNissan and other competitors may feel compelled to boost wages to retain their workforce. The union made its intention to expand autoworker unionization clear in a series of posts on social media late Sunday that highlighted the length of the contract, which ends in 2028.\n\"One of our biggest goals coming out of this historic contract victory is to organize like we\u2019ve never organized before,\" the UAW wrote. \"When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won\u2019t just be with the Big Three, but with the Big Five or Big Six.\"\nPublic support for unions has helped engagement in traditionally unionized industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. A Reuters poll showed the majority of Americans stand behind striking workers.\nEmployee-led unionization efforts at retailers, such as Amazon and Starbucks, have reflected a consensus among workers who see unions as a means to secure better wages and working conditions.\nOrganization has been difficult in recent years. About 11.3% of workers were represented by unions last year compared with 23.6% in 1982, according to data analyzed by the Economic Policy Institute.\nRIPPLE EFFECT\nThe UAW contracts are among many deals reached this year, along with agreements at UPS and construction equipment maker Caterpillar. Workers at other companies, like Mack Truck and equipment makers CNH Industrial and Deere & Co have all rebuffed initial deals despite raises that in some contracts appeared significant.\nIncreased awareness among workers about record profits has translated to company concessions and improved deals, said Marcos Feldman, senior researcher at Jobs to Move America, a labor organizing nonprofit.\n\"The task is to solidify and institutionalize it,\" Feldman said. \"Unionizing efforts are the most aggressive they've ever been.\"\nPresident Joe Biden considers unions a cornerstone of his economic policies, including the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law to boost American manufacturing.\nEmployers may respond by boosting worker pay to hold off union efforts, or step up efforts to prevent unionization.\nSome Starbucks employees have claimed the coffee chain illegally retaliated against organizers by firing employees and closing stores. Earlier this month the U.S. Department of Labor ordered the company to disclose documents pertaining to anti-union spending.\nAmazon has dissuaded unionization, with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) recently ruling the e-commerce giant had threatened to withhold wages and benefits from employees at two New York warehouses.\nUPS AND ITS RIVALS\nThe UPS deal in August raised pay and eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers at the Atlanta-based company. That bolstered organizing efforts among Amazon workers and put pressure on UPS rivals to close a growing gap in pay.\nWhen the new UPS agreement expires in 2028, the average full-time U.S. driver will make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits, significantly more than peers employed by contractors for Amazon and FedEx.\nAmazon in September gave delivery contractors $440 million for the year to raise average driver pay to an estimated $20.50 per hour. Amazon told Reuters that payment was part of normal increases and not influenced by the UPS contract. It did not provide prior-year comparisons. FedEx said it regularly reviews pay for directly employed delivery workers to ensure that it is competitive and that its delivery contractors set their own wage rates.\n\"One thing we've seen in this economy is that workers are more likely to quit when they are unhappy,\" said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. \"Industries where they're more likely to stay are the ones where they unionize and they stay and fight.\"\n(Reporting by Bianca Flowers; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Alistair Bell)",

Lawmakers have criticized the government for quickly rolling out support without regard for the cost to taxpayers.\nMost of the problems are with loans issued to small firms under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme. Across the program, banks have flagged 3.75% of loans by value as suspected fraud, according to the government.\nBarclays Plc, the largest lender in the program, said over 6% of its loans were now considered possible fraud, up from 2.3% earlier in the year. Starling Bank, which lent \u00a31.6 billion under BBLS, has also flagged 6%, or about \u00a397 million, of its drawn loans as potential fraud.\n\u201cWe continue to proactively tackle BBLS fraud, going above and beyond the requirements of the government lending schemes,\u201d a Barclays spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis has included a pilot to investigate the use of, and proactively recover BBLS funds through our work with liquidators and a litigation funder.\u201d\nThe lender last year asked UK courts to shutter nearly 100 businesses as it sought to recover Covid-19 debts.\n\u201cStarling takes a strong and proactive stance on BBLS to protect taxpayers\u2019 money, as well as to support our customers to help them repay their loans,\u201d the bank said in a statement. \u201cOur lending saved thousands of companies. It largely supported eligible micro businesses with single directors, many of which were relatively young businesses.\u201d\nThe Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, aimed at larger companies, is showing much lower levels of suspected fraud.

        "text": "\nIn this article, we will be taking a look at the 30 most fertile countries in the world heading into 2024. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most fertile countries in the world heading into 2024.\nThe fertility rate is one of the most important indicators for countries and global bodies to assess future requirements and resource allocation, and in this respect, both really high and really low fertility rates can have devastating consequences. While we'll discuss the negative impact of high fertility rates as we further talk about the most fertile countries in the world heading into 2024, we'll first consider the impact of low birth rates in countries such as Japan and South Korea.\nA cultural shift has led to younger people in Japan balking at the thought of marriage or starting a family, especially due to concerns regarding job opportunities and the income needed to sufficiently support a family. At the same time, Japan's high life expectancy (it has the second highest life expectancy in the world in 2023) has led to it being home to a more aging population which has brought a myriad of problems to the country. The healthcare system in the country has struggled immensely to provide the necessary care needed for an increasingly aging population while economic growth has also suffered. The decline in labor force has of course, negatively impacted the economy and will continue to do so unless a major shift takes place. While Japan is encouraging its residents to have kids and is providing support to people starting a family, if the policy is not successful, there may be more repercussions in the future. This is why there are several companies operating in the fertility space and offering scientific solutions to improve the chances of a successful birth. Even in the United State, there are several such companies aiming to provide couples with solutions on having a child even if they are unable to conceive naturally.\nLolostock/Shutterstock.com\nOne such company operating in the fertility space is Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) which offers over 900 fertility specialists which provide information on different topics relating to fertility. Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) has seen its share price rise by nearly 10% YTD 2023 and has demonstrated exceptional growth in recent results, as mentioned in the company's Q2 2023 earnings call, where it stated \"We're pleased to report that Progyny had a very solid second quarter, highlighted by record quarterly revenue of $279 million or 43% growth over the second quarter of 2022. The strength in this quarter's result reflect that member activity continues to be healthy, further affirming not only the essential nature of fertility care but also the strong desire amongst members to pursue the appropriate medical treatments they need in order to realize their family-building goals..... Last month, the CDC released its annual outcomes data on the fertility industry in the US, reflecting treatments completed through the end of '21. For the seventh straight year, Progyny has significantly outperformed the national averages across every relevant benchmark for success. As a reminder, Progyny is the only solution that is doing comprehensive outcomes reporting, reflecting virtually every treatment for every member across all relevant metrics. You will see these results reported in our second quarter 10-Q. Since launching our solution in 2016, we've consistently achieved higher pregnancy rates, higher live birth rates, lower rates of miscarriages and significantly fewer multiple births. Our superior clinical results not only create a better member experience as they ensure members avoid unnecessary treatments and painful complications, they also drive cost containment for our clients given that Progyny members on average require fewer treatments in order to get to the desired outcome of a healthy baby.\"\nProgyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) was also highlighted by Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy, which made the following comment about Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\u201cThe top contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s relative performance in the second quarter included AppFolio, Goosehead Insurance, and Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY). Finally, Progyny, a provider of fertility benefits to self-insured companies, continues to deliver powerful results headlined by 50% YoY revenue growth and 87% YoY adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) growth. Concerns about the impact of significant tech layoffs on their business have been put to rest, as the secular tailwind around the demand for high-quality fertility and family-building care remains very much intact. The combination of these powerful secular tailwinds and the company\u2019s industry diversification efforts over the last few years has translated into sustained and resilient growth in the face of macro uncertainty.\u201d\nAt the other end of the spectrum are the most fertile countries in the world heading into 2024, most of which are located in Africa, a region already suffering from poverty and a low standard of living. Extremely high birth rates simply add more pressure on the economy as the resources needed to improve the standard of living far outweigh the economy of such nations. This is one of the reasons why countries with higher fertility rates also face greater instances of starvation and malnutrition.\nTo combat this, many companies and governmental bodies are starting programs and encouraging family planning. Unfortunately, birth control and family planning are strongly linked to religious and traditional values, which makes it harder to be effective especially in the most fertile countries in the world which generally have strong religious and traditional connotations. Many countries have banned outright medical processes such as abortion hence, have removed a safe way to avoid having children if the family doesn't want to.\nHowever, to provide for the ever-increasing contraceptive market, said to be worth around $28 billion and expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% till 2030, many companies are aiming to carve out their presence in this industry. One of the most well-known contraceptive brands is Durex, manufactured by Reckitt Benckiser group and part of their Wellness Care portfolio. Durex is the top-selling condom brand in the world and extremely important to the overall performance of Reckitt Benckiser, who mentioned its performance in the company's Q2 2023 earnings report, stating \"Our Health business has had a strong first half, delivering 8.8% like-for-like net revenue growth and high 20s adjusted operating margins. Our OTC and intimate wellness portfolios in particular have performed very well..... Our Health business has had a strong first half, delivering 8.8% like-for-like net revenue growth and high 20s adjusted operating margins. Our OTC and intimate wellness portfolios in particular have performed very well.... In intimate wellness, we launched Durex Invisible ultra-thin condoms designed to maximize sensitivity.\" However, other portfolios have not performed as well because of which Reckitt Benckiser has seen its share price slip by 1.45% YTD 2023.\nMethodology\nTo determine the most fertile countries in the world, we obtained data from the World Bank showing births per woman by country for 2020 and 2021, the last two years on record. We then calculated the average birth rate of each country for these two years and ranked each country from highest birth rate per woman to lowest.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.05\nGuinea-Bissau has done really well to see a decline in birth rates while also significantly improving child mortality rates, though this decline was reversed in 2022.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.13\nLiberia's population grew by 1.7 million in the 2022 National Census, directly as a result of high birth rates in the country.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.20\nEthiopia has done really well to reduce its birth rate and now women in the country are having a lot fewer children than their mothers, with a major contributing factor being women staying longer in schools.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.20\nRepublic of Congo's high birth rates ensures it remains among the countries with the highest fertility rates in the world right now.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.29\nTogo has seen a stark decline in birth rate considering that its birth rate was even higher than Nigeria's in 1960, and if it continues this way, could even drop off our list in the coming years.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.31\nA lack of female education and empowerment has contributed to the country's high birth rates.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.34\nThe average population of Zambia is young, which leads to higher fertility rates, which in turn leads to an even younger overall population, in a self perpetuating cycle.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.42\nIn low-income countries such as Senegal, more children mean more future providers, which is one of the reasons behind the country's high fertility rate.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.43\nMauritania is home to not just high birth rates but also high maternal death rates, and the government needs to introduce more programs to reduce both, and improve safety for women in the country.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.44\nRecent declines in Guinea's birth rate have been very low, and a lot more needs to be done in this respect.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.45\nThe decline in birth rates in Cote d'Ivoire has slowed down recently, but is still a large decline from 6.6 just over three decades ago.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.50\nSudan has seen birth rates fall significantly from more than 7 in in the 1970s to 4.5 in 2021, but it is still among the countries with the highest fertility rates in the world heading into 2024.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.50\nCameroon is among several African countries which adhere to pro-natalist population policies, explaining the higher fertility rates in the country.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.51\nIn the 12 years since South Sudan gained independence, it has faced a host of challenges, though it has done well to see a strong decline in the last decade in birth rates.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.64\nUganda's government is playing its part in reducing birth rates in Uganda by creating more demand and greater access to family planning services.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.68\nWhile Mozambique saw its fertility rate decline somewhat from 2020 to 2021, it is still a long way away from reaching the rate needed to be in line with economic growth.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.70\nAfghanistan is the only non-African country in our list of the countries with the highest fertility rates in the world heading into 2024.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.73\nIn West Africa, few countries have a higher birth rate than Gambia, with women not afforded the status they deserve and not having the rights they deserve.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.76\nBecause of high poverty levels, many people in Tanzania get married early, which in turn leads to more kids.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 4.82\nBurkina Faso's fertility rate barely decreased from 2020 to 2021, and more needs to be done by the government to encourage birth control.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.01\nBenin has a relatively high teenage pregnancy rate in the world, with 92 of every 1,000 girls from the ages of 15 to 19 giving birth in the country in 2021.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.13\nWhile the overall world is in a reproduction crisis as global birth rates have fallen significantly, and while still really high, Burundi has also seen its birth rate fall to some extent in the past decade.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.27\nNigeria has done really well to significantly reduce its fertility rate in recent years, but even then, is projected to become among the most populated countries in the world by 2050 as the birth rate is still relatively high.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.34\nA high population of children inevitably follows high birth rates and fertility rates, and Angola had one of the highest number of unvaccinated children in 2022 as a direct consequence, showing how poorer countries with the highest fertility rates in the world can have repercussions for children.\nAverage Birth rate per woman: 5.98\nBecause of high birth rates, around 48% of Central African Republic's population is less than 14 years old, adding significantly more pressure to the economy of the country.\nClick to continue reading the 5 Most Fertile Countries in the World Heading into 2024.

        "text": "\n(Updates prices throughout, includes table on yen options) By Rae Wee SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The battered yen was stuck near a three-decade low against the dollar on Tuesday, struggling to find a floor as the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) ultra-easy monetary policy settings remained at odds with the prospect of higher-for-longer rates elsewhere. The Japanese currency slumped to a 15-year low of 162.38 per euro in early Asia trade and slid to a roughly three-month trough of 186.25 per British pound. Against the dollar, the yen last stood at 151.70, languishing near a one-year low of 151.92 hit on Monday. A break below last year's trough of 151.94 per dollar would mark a fresh 33-year low for the yen. The yen had jumped briefly against the greenback in New York hours on Monday after striking the year-to-date low, which analysts attributed to a flurry of trading in options that come due this week rather than any intervention moves from Japanese authorities. DTCC data from LSEG's Eikon platform shows yen options worth a notional $3.5 billion with strike prices between 151.90 and 152 are due to expire between Wednesday and Friday. \"I think options could continue to act as a resistance for dollar/yen,\" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \"So will fears of further BOJ intervention.\" Japanese authorities in September last year intervened in the currency market to boost the yen for the first time since 1998, after a BOJ decision to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy drove the yen as low as 145 per dollar. It intervened again in October 2022 after the yen plunged to a 32-year low of 151.94. Despite the BOJ's carefully orchestrated steps this year to phase out its controversial yield curve control (YCC) policy and hints of an imminent end to negative interest rates, the piecemeal moves have done little to sustain a rally in the yen, particularly as central banks globally maintain their hawkish rhetoric of higher-for-longer rates. \"I think the market has come to the realisation that the Bank of Japan is going to exit its policy but at a very, very, very slow and cautious pace,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (NAB). INFLATION AND THE FED Outside of Asia, traders also had their attention on U.S. inflation figures due later on Tuesday, which will provide further clarity on whether the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates even further to tame inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his chorus of policymakers have in recent days pushed back against market expectations that the U.S. central bank was done with its aggressive rate-hike cycle after it held rates steady at its latest policy meeting. The comments have kept the U.S. dollar bid and against the greenback, the New Zealand dollar fell to an over one-week low of $0.5866. The kiwi was last 0.17% lower at $0.5867. Sterling eased 0.03% to $1.2274, while the euro gave up 0.03% to trade at $1.0695. \"Overall, the market is also kind of worn out by all messages coming from central banks and the higher-for-longer and wait-and-see mode is keeping volatility low,\" said NAB's Catril. \"We need to wait for that CPI number tonight, which could be a bit of a shaker. If it's strong, then obviously it brings in the idea that another rate hike from the Fed is there.\" The U.S. dollar index rose 0.07% to 105.70. Down Under, the Australian dollar dipped 0.15% to $0.6367. Domestic data was mixed with Australian business conditions holding firm in October, but consumer confidence sliding in the wake of last week's rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The decision was taken \u201cin view of the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians, and Israel\u2019s refusal of calls for cease-fire and continuous and unhindered flow of humanitarian aid,\u201d the ministry said.\nIsrael Says Hamas Attacked During Evacuation Window (6:15 p.m.)\nIsrael\u2019s army said Hamas took advantage of a three-hour window the IDF declared Saturday for civilians to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip, attacking troops with mortars and anti-tank missiles to prevent them from opening a humanitarian corridor. \u201cThis incident further proves that Hamas exploits the Gazan population and prevents them from acting in the interest of their own safety,\u201d the IDF said in a statement on its Telegram channel. No Israeli troops were injured in the attack, the IDF said.\nRead more: Middle East Foreign Ministers Set to Discuss Gaza With Blinken\nUS Says Hamas Demands Delayed Gaza Evacuation Deal (3:30 p.m.)\nThe militant group\u2019s demands to get some of its fighters out of the Gaza Strip as part of a deal to allow the evacuation of foreigners and people with dual nationalities led to delays in finalizing the deal, according to a senior US official.\nHamas wanted some of the Palestinians wounded in Israeli attacks to be transferred to Egypt via the Rafah border crossing, a demand the US didn\u2019t oppose, said the official, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive issues.\nBut about one third of the people put forward by Hamas were actually fighters for the militant group, which the US didn\u2019t consider viable, the official said. Hamas later withdrew the names, and the first people able to leave Gaza under the framework went through Rafah on Wednesday.\nUN Set For $1.2 Billion Donation Appeal for Palestinians (2:45 p.m.)\nThe United Nations is set to make an appeal for $1.2 billion in donations for 2.7 million Palestinians, including the entire population of Gaza.\nThe UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Nov. 6 will issue an appeal for the donations by year-end to meet the needs of 2.2 million people in Gaza and 500,000 in the West Bank.\nAn original appeal made on Oct. 12 asked for $294 million to support nearly 1.3 million people.\nIsraeli Jets Strike Hezbollah Targets After Shooting From Lebanon (2:04 p.m.)\nIsraeli aircraft bombed targets in response to earlier firing from Lebanese territory, alongside strikes using artillery and tanks, the army said.

Israel says 33 of its soldiers have been killed.\nOne clip from the Hamas video released on Wednesday showed fighters running past piles of debris and stopping to fire shoulder-propelled missiles at Israeli tanks. Another showed them shooting rifles from perches behind buildings and dumpsters. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage.\nSaleh al-Arouri, an exiled Hamas commander, told Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV that Israeli forces may gain control of some areas in Gaza.\n\"But that will not stop the resistance's fight against soldiers and tanks. The more (Israel) spreads and expands on the ground, the deeper its losses will become\", he said.\nISRAEL BOMBS TUNNELS\nChief Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Wednesday combat engineers were using explosive devices to destroy Hamas' tunnel network that stretches for hundreds of kilometres (miles) beneath Gaza. The military said it had destroyed 130 tunnel shafts so far.\nIsrael has blamed Hamas for civilian deaths in Gaza, saying that it is using Gazans as human shields and hiding arms and operations centres in residential areas.\nAs the war entered its second month, Israeli troops took foreign reporters to the edges of Gaza City on Wednesday. Journalists saw a devastated landscape where every building within sight was scarred by battle.\nWalls were blown away while bullet holes and shrapnel dotted the facades and palm trees were shredded and broken.\nLieutenant Colonel Ido, deputy commander of the 401st Brigade, who did not give his last name, said that by the time soldiers reached these buildings, all the families had left.\n\"So we know that everyone here is our enemy. We have not seen any civilians here. Only Hamas,\" he said, standing in a badly damaged children's bedroom that was painted pink.\nSoldiers on the press tour said that beneath the family apartment were two floors of workshops used to make weapons, including drones discovered in five wooden boxes. It was not possible to verify the claim.\n50,000 PALESTINIANS HEAD SOUTH\nSome 50,000 Palestinian civilians left the north on Wednesday, Hagari said, during a four-hour window of opportunity announced by Israel. He said they left \"because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the north\".\nThousands still remain inside the encircled north, including at Gaza City's main Al Shifa hospital, where Um Haitham Hejela was sheltering with her young children in an improvised tent.\n\"The situation is getting worse day after day,\" she said. \"There is no food, no water. When my son goes to pick up water, he queues for three or four hours in the line.\"\nThe Israeli military has repeatedly told residents to evacuate the north or risk being trapped in the violence. Huge numbers of displaced people from among Gaza's 2.3 million population are already crammed into schools, hospitals and other sites in the south.\nBut the central and southern parts of the small, besieged Palestinian enclave also came under fire again.\nPalestinian health officials said an airstrike that hit houses in the Nusseirat refugee camp killed 18 people on Wednesday morning. In Khan Younis, six people, including a young girl, were killed in an airstrike.\n\"We were sitting in peace when all of a sudden an F16 airstrike landed on a house and blew it up, the entire block, three houses next to each other,\" said a witness, Mohammed Abu Daqa.\n\"Civilians, all of them civilians. An old woman, an old man and there are others still missing under the rubble.\"\nInternational alarm is mounting over the humanitarian toll of Israel's onslaught. The level of death and suffering is \"hard to fathom\", U.N. health agency spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said in Geneva.\nU.N. officials and G7 world powers stepped up appeals for a humanitarian pause in the war to help alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza, where necessities including food, medicine and fuel are running out.\nNegotiations mediated by Qatar, where several Hamas political leaders are based, are trying to secure the release of 10 to 15 hostages in exchange for a one- to two-day humanitarian pause in Gaza, a source briefed on the talks said on Wednesday.\nPOSSIBLE THIRD STRIKE ON JABALIA\nAt least 19 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house near a hospital in north Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp on Wednesday, the enclave's interior ministry said.\nThere was no immediate Israeli comment or details from the scene of the reported attack, which if confirmed would be the third on Gaza's largest refugee camp in a week.\nPalestinian authorities said at least 195 civilians were killed in those Israeli strikes which flattened multi-storey dwellings.\nIsrael said its air attacks on Jabalia last week killed two Hamas commanders and a number of militants while targeting operational tunnels dug beneath civilian districts.\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza, Maytaal Angel, Emily Rose and Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem, Rami Amichay in Tel Aviv and Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Writing by Angus MacSwan, Mark Heinrich and Cynthia Osterman; Editing by Peter Graff, Alex Richardson, Grant McCool and Howard Goller)",

        "text": "\nBy Jamie McGeever\nDec 1 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\nAsian markets round out the week on Friday in reasonably good spirits, with a deluge of purchasing managers index data from across the continent and a sprinkling of key indicators from Japan, South Korea and Indonesia the most likely market-moving catalysts.\nFriday is also the first trading day of December, so perhaps an opportunity to get the last month of the year off to a positive start. The Dow Jones on Thursday posted its highest close in nearly two years, and if broader market momentum from November spills over, that is a likely scenario - for some Asian stock markets, November was the best month in a long time. On the other hand, Thursday's month-end reversal in the dollar and bonds - the dollar and Treasury yields rose sharply - will sound a loud note of caution. Unemployment data from Japan, trade data from South Korea, and the latest readout on inflation from Indonesia are among the highlights on the Asian economic calendar, along with a raft of purchasing managers index reports from across the region. They include Australia, South Korea and India, as well as China's 'unofficial' PMI. The 'official' PMI report from the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed that manufacturing activity in China shrank for a second month in November, and at a faster rate than had been expected.\nA similar reading on Friday will only enhance the already growing calls for more stimulus.\nChina's leading index of blue chip stocks fell 2% in November, its fourth monthly decline in a row. It is down almost 10% year-to-date, underperforming most of its regional and global peers.\nThe MSCI Asia ex-Japan and emerging market indexes both snapped three-month losing streaks in November, rising 7% or more for their best month since January, while Japan's Nikkei gained 8.5% for its best month in three years.\nThe general gloom surrounding China's economy and financial markets shows little sign of lifting, despite some sporadic positive surprises recently like the strong third quarter GDP growth figures. A survey by central banking think tank OMFIF of 22 public pension and sovereign wealth funds managing $4.3 trillion in assets, showed that none reported a positive outlook for China's economy. They cited the regulatory environment and geopolitics among primary factors dissuading them from investing. Foreigners already appear to be voting with their feet - China just recorded its first-ever quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment.\nAs more aggressive Fed rate cut expectations chip away at the U.S. dollar, investors are turning more bullish on Asian currencies, a Reuters poll found. Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the few exceptions is the Chinese yuan.\nStill, the yuan is trading around its strongest level against the dollar since June and just clocked its biggest monthly gain in a year, rising around 2.5% in November.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday:\n- PMIs for Australia, South Korea, India, China\n- Japan unemployment (October)\n- Indonesia inflation (October)\n(By Jamie McGeever Editing by Josie Kao)",

        "text": "\nHANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 To meet the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), nine major Asian economies must increase the share of electricity they get from renewable energy from the current 6% to at least 50% by 2030, according to a report by a German thinktank released Wednesday.\nNearly a third of that renewable energy should come from wind and solar power, said the report by researchers of Berlin-based Agora Energiewende. A fifth would be hydropower and other clean sources and the remainder, fossil fuels.\nThe study analyzed energy plans of both developing nations like Indonesia and Vietnam, where demand for energy is growing rapidly, and wealthier places like Japan and South Korea, which have among the highest burdens of per capita greenhouse gas emissions. It did not include China, the world's biggest emitter of carbon, or India, another major contributor.\nA global temperature increase of 1.5C (2.7F) since pre-industrial times is considered a critical climate threshold beyond which risks of catastrophes rise. The world will likely lose most of its coral reefs, a key ice sheet could kick into irreversible melt, and water shortages, heat waves and death from extreme weather may surge, according to an earlier United Nations scientific report.\nAgora Energiewende researchers found that Asian nations are united in their heavy reliance on fossil fuels and national plans are not aligned with ambitious climate pledges announced by their governments.\nBy using proven technologies like wind and solar power, countries can avoid exceeding limits they have set and also limit investment in fossil fuel infrastructure they won't need, said Mathis Rogner, the Southeast Asia project lead for Agora Energiewende and a co-author of the report.\nTo conform with 1.5C (2.7F) limit, the nine countries included in the study need to add 45 to 55 gigawatts of solar energy and 20 gigawatts of wind energy every year. In 2021, they had installed a total of just 11.9 gigawatts of solar energy and 1.5 gigawatts of wind energy.\nThe study reviewed energy plans of Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Taiwan.\nAs of the end of 2022, the U.S. had installed capacity of more than 144 GW of wind power and 110 GW of solar photovoltaic power.\nThe need for urgent action was echoed by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for a \u201cclimate ambition supernova\u201d after a U.N. analysis released Tuesday found that countries\u2019 climate plans still lagged far behind what was needed.\nMuch of the clean energy capacity the world has added since 2016 has been concentrated in the U.S., China and India. Even though wind and solar technologies have been getting cheaper every year, among other Asian nations, only Japan and Vietnam derive more than a tenth of their capacity from the wind and the sun.\nThe vast increases in Chinese and Indian renewable energy capacity are an example for other Asian countries that lag behind. They also show how such transitions can create jobs and improve energy security, said Kanika Chawla, chief of staff at Sustainable Energy for All, the United Nations\u2019 sustainable energy unit, who was not involved in the report.\nMany countries still rely heavily on large hydropower dams, which can involve hefty social and environmental costs and are vulnerable to drought.\nThe report estimates that South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia each should add between 8 and 14 gigawatts of solar power annually. Indonesia now gets less than 1% of its power from wind and solar energy, according to a study by the U.K.-based thinktank Ember. South Korea and Thailand also still mostly depend on fossil fuel.\nJapan needs to add an average of 9 gigawatts of solar power a year and Vietnam, around 10 gigawatts, to meet end-of-the-decade targets. But the report says the goals are achievable since both countries have managed similar increases in the past.\nThe report says Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines need to add between 1 and 3 gigawatts of energy from the sun each year to their grid.\nSouth Korea needs the biggest spurt in wind power \u2014 an average increase of 8 gigawatts each year \u2014 while Japan needs to add about 3 gigawatts. Vietnam should be deploying around 4 gigawatts in new wind power capacity, the report said.\nLower potential for wind power in other countries means they should target between one and 2 gigawatts each year.\nThe report calls for a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d to speed up the transition to wind and solar power. That would include removing subsidies for oil and gas that make renewables less competitive, simplifying bureaucratic hurdles such as permits and facilitating investments.\nAt the same time, power grids need to be upgraded to allow for the variability and unpredictability of wind and solar power, it said.\nDespite a common misconception that wind and solar are more expensive and less stable than fossil fuel-powered generation, \u201cOur analysis shows that often much higher shares of wind and solar can be reliably integrated into the power system than the operators expect,\u201d Rogner of Agora said.\n___\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

So, don't touch the Camembert \u2014 never, ever.\nOn Wednesday, legislators at the European Parliament made sure it won't happen anytime soon.\nTucked in a proposal on streamlining and optimizing waste management throughout the 27-nation bloc, some French cheese producers in recent weeks sniffed out something and turned it into a culinary stink.\nThey claimed that the proposal's wording would make it illegal for the famous cheese to be cradled into its usual wooden packaging for its final weeks of ripening and, eventually, sale. The round box is as essentially Camembert as its unctuous texture and pungent smell.\nSuddenly, there was a frenzied flutter that something fundamentally French would fall foul of the Brussels bureaucrats \u2014 derisively known by many as Eurocrats \u2014 who are all too often blamed for flaws real and false.\n\u201cIt is a matter of common sense. Don\u2019t touch our Camemberts!\u201d said Jean-Paul Garraud, a member of the European Parliament for France\u2019s far-right Rassemblement National.\nThe reasoning was this: If Camembert were forced into something easier to recycle like plastic, the perfect breathing of the cheese through wood might instead produce something sweaty and flabby. Wood, however, is hard to recycle sustainably, and the EU wants to remove it from food packaging as much as possible.\nEnvironment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius said ahead of Wednesday's vote that the EU would make sure that the raw-milk specialized non-industrial Camemberts \u2014 those with a controlled designation of origin \u2014 will be exempt from any such regulation.\nEven Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the French World War II hero and later president of the nation, knew all about such gourmet sensitivities. \u201cHow do you want to run a country that has 246 kinds of cheese,\u201d he was quoted as complaining.\nWednesday's action proved that cheese can be an effective binding agent, as European legislators ranging from free-trade liberals to the far-right made sure that an amendment to allow wooden boxes in case of exceptional circumstances would survive.\n\u201cWe have saved our Camemberts,\u201d said French free-trade Renew Europe legislator Valerie Hayer after the vote. And she said others will be safe under the measure: \u201cCamembert, Pont l\u2019\u00c9v\u00eaque or Mont d\u2019Or will be well protected.\"\nThe center-right European People's Party, the biggest group in the European Parliament with a traditional farming electorate and penchant for heritage protection, led the defense of the wooden boxes for Camembert and other cheeses.\n\u201cWho can imagine a Camembert or a Mont d\u2019Or without its wooden strapping? Packaging them in plastic would be a gustatory and environmental aberration,\" said French MEP Laurence Sailliet.\n\u201cEurope must know how to protect the environment, but never to the detriment of the specific characteristics of its member states,\u201d she added.\nAnd food is one of the touchiest characteristics for sure.\nThe British used anti-EU food foment to the extreme in the years leading up to Brexit, with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then still a Brussels journalist, leading the tabloid assault with stories that the EU would insist that bananas would have to be straight and eliminate beloved British biscuits.\nIt helped turn the United Kingdom against the EU, and voters decided in a referendum to leave.",

Unemployment is predicted to peak at 4.25% at end-2024 and then hold at that level through the following year.\n\u201cThe domestic economy has proved more resilient than previously expected, and the labor market is expected to ease more gradually as a result,\u201d the RBA said of its forecasts, which are based on a cash rate assumed to peak at around 4.5%. \u201cThe prospect of higher inflation over the year ahead increases the risk of embedding higher inflation expectations in price-setting decisions.\u201d\nThe central bank ended a four-meeting pause on Tuesday to hike the cash rate to a 12-year high of 4.35% in order to try to rein in prices.\nThe RBA\u2019s restating of much of what it said in Tuesday\u2019s rate statement saw Australian three-year government bonds rebound to pare declines. The yield on the notes was at 4.23%, up 7 basis points on the day, after trading at 4.25% before the statement.\nMany economists including at Commonwealth Bank of Australia now predict the RBA has probably finished hiking, though National Australia Bank and Royal Bank of Canada are among a handful that see at least one more hike to 4.6%. Money market bets imply rates will remain above 4% over the next year.\n\u201cThe board\u2019s priority is to return inflation to target,\u201d the RBA said. \u201cWhether further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe will depend upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks,\u201d it said, reiterating Tuesday\u2019s statement.\nThe RBA said it will continue to closely monitor the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labor market in making its decisions.\n\u201cOn face value, the new forecasts set leans hawkish given the size of the near-term revisions and indicates the RBA is further from its targets than previously thought,\u201d said Tom Kennedy at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\u201cBut upgrades were widely expected heading into the release, and the leadership had nevertheless chosen to slightly raise the bar for further tightening with this week\u2019s guidance changes,\u201d he said.\nInflation remains above 5% in year-ended terms, \u201cwell above\u201d the target, the central bank noted. It said services-price strength is likely to persist for a while driven by labor market tightness and rising energy costs. Rent inflation is also set to remain high as surging population growth in recent quarters adds to demand in an already tight market.\nAnother factor adding to inflation is wage growth, which is seen peaking at 4% this year, from 4.1% forecast in August, and holding at that level in the first half of 2024 before easing thereafter. The RBA highlighted persistent poor productivity growth among upside risks to inflation. On the other hand, declines in global cost pressures and tepid inflation in China could bring down overall consumer prices.\nAustralia\u2019s housing market has staged a surprising turnaround, rising for consecutive months since February amid the combined effects of high demand buoyed partly by strong population growth and limited supply. In addition, construction activity continues to be limited by capacity constraints because of labor shortages and a tightening of financial conditions.\nThe RBA highlighted household consumption as a \u201ckey source\u201d of uncertainty, though a resilient labor market and higher house prices are likely to support sentiment. It added that spending in the economy has been supported by a rebound in international students and tourists.\n--With assistance from Swati Pandey and Garfield Reynolds.\n(Adds comment from economist in ninth-10th paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

That will open the door for both central banks to begin \u201ca gradual easing\u201d in monetary policy from late next year.\nGoldman\u2019s take sharply contrasts with forecasts from Australia\u2019s central bank which raised interest rates just last week to a 12-year-high of 4.35%, predicting CPI will overshoot its 2-3% target until mid-2025. On Monday, Reserve Bank of Australia Acting Assistant Governor Marion Kohler said the next stage of bringing inflation back to target is likely to be more \u201cdrawn out.\u201d\nGoldman does see upside risks to inflation for Australia driven by a combination of stronger-than-expected wages growth, ongoing weak productivity, rising energy costs and persistently strong housing prices.\n\u201cOur working assumption is that the RBA remains a \u2018reluctant hiker\u2019 and their reaction function does not change materially in the near term,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cHowever, we caution that several important decisions on RBA board appointments and implementation of the RBA review are imminent,\u201d\nNew Zealand\u2019s central bank has hiked at a much more rapid pace than the RBA, taking its official cash rate to 5.5%.\nEven so, the downside risks to New Zealand\u2019s economic growth have eased, Goldman said, though recent inflation and labor force reports \u201chave strengthened our conviction that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will remain on hold well into 2024.\u201d\nBased on its latest forecasts published in August, the RBNZ sees inflation returning to its 1-3% target in the third quarter of 2024.\nThere are risks to the RBNZ\u2019s reaction function too, Goldman said, given an election pledge by the National Party, which will lead the next government, to remove the maximum sustainable employment component of the RBNZ\u2019s existing dual mandate.\n\u201cThe balance of risks to our RBA/RBNZ base case is skewed to higher rates in the near term,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cConsistent with our global economic team\u2019s approach, we have also revised higher our longer run RBA/RBNZ rate forecasts by +50-basis-points to 3.50%.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Investors are beginning to sniff an opportunity where the rating agencies see trouble \u2014 Chile\u2019s Falabella SA.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nRussia Downs Drones Over Moscow in Ukrainian Retaliatory Strike\nBillions Wiped Out as Stock-Safety Trade on Wall Street Misfires\nMusk, Netanyahu Visit Massacre Site Amid Antisemitism Furor\nTreasuries Rise After US Sales on Dovish Fed Bets: Markets Wrap\nSodium in Batteries: Shift May Herald Another Shakeup\nJust days after the company, which owns malls, department stores and supermarkets, unveiled plans to reduce its debt load and return to profitability, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings both cut the company to junk last week. The bonds due 2032 dropped 2.53 cents on the dollar to 70.59 cents in the week.\nBut with the notes now hovering just above record lows, investors are taking a more benevolent view of the retailer that racked up losses after investing heavily in e-commerce amid stiff competition and weak consumer spending. Plans to sell as much as $1 billion in assets may have left the rating agencies cold, but they impressed some bondholders.\n\u201cIn the longer term, it\u2019s a great story,\u201d said Elizabeth Bakarich, an emerging markets corporate debt portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, who noted there is not much in the corporate bond space in Chile that is high yield. \u201cAt these spreads we\u2019re interested in the opportunity it creates.\u201d\nBakarich manages an emerging markets debt portfolio that includes Falabella bonds due in 2027.\nDebt Load\n\u201cWe are working with a sense of urgency to strengthen our financial position,\u201d Falabella said in a response to emailed questions. \u201cWe hope that our attempts to boost efficiency, combined with the normalization of the macro environment and the sale of assets, will enable us to recover investment grade as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe company has seen its total debt to Ebitda increase steadily since 2021. The ratio now stands at 7.32, compared with 3.8 and 5.97 at local peers Cencosud SA and Parque Arauco SA, respectively.\nYet plans to unload assets, starting with a 66.6% stake in mall operator Mall Plaza Peru, should start to ease that debt burden next year. Falabella plans to sell the unit to another of its subsidiaries Mall Plaza.\n\u201cWith the 10-year yields at almost 8% for Falabella, I consider it a good level to enter,\u201d said Nicolas Morande, partner at wealth advisory firm Damon Capital.\nStill, the bonds could get worse before they get better. The double downgrade means funds with only investment grade bonds will now have to sell. At the same time, both rating agencies kept the company outlook at negative, indicating more cuts are possible.\nThe bonds had priced in the downgrade, but not the negative outlook, said Josefina Valdivia, fixed income manager at Credicorp Capital.\nAll the same, the downward pressure on the bonds may be muted as forced selling by investment grade funds might only impact 8.8% and 7.6% of the amount outstanding of the 2027 and 2032 notes, respectively, JPMorgan analyst Eugenia Cavalheiro wrote in a note to clients in September. JPMorgan said last week that no new analysis was available on the exposure to these funds.\nAchilles Heel\nBakarich says investors don\u2019t think the company has a liquidity issue and doesn\u2019t need to raise fresh capital. Its Achilles heel is communication.\n\u201cThe company has deleveraging plans, but they weren\u2019t as specific as they needed to be in terms of those assets, what their timeline was and what their leverage targets were over the near term,\u201d Bakarich said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely more that they could have done to inform the broader market.\u201d\nCredicorp\u2019s Valdivia says Falabella also needs to make more structural, strategic changes, such as reducing capital expenditure. And if Mall Plaza has to issue debt to finance the purchase of Mall Plaza Peru, it won\u2019t help delevarage Falabella as it has a controlling stake, she said.\nIf the businesses continues to deteriorate, there could be another downgrade, and recovering their investment grade would take a long time, Valdivia said. Their goal should be to get a \u201cpositive\u201d outlook in the next six to 12 months.\nUncertainty over who will succeed Gaston Bottazzini as CEO could also weigh on the bonds. Bottazzini resigned in September after the plunge into losses.\nThe new management has \u201cto give confidence,\u201d Bakarich said. \u201cA new CEO needs to inspire that.\u201d\nAt the same time, investors need to understand the company is cyclical and be patient to see results of the cost reductions, she said.\n\u201cWe believe their willingness to bring this back to investment grade is high,\u201d Bakarich said. \u201cWe think their plan is credible and we think that they have the ability to execute on it.\u201d\nECONOMIC CALENDAR:\nAll events in Santiago local time.\nChile\nNov. 29 9am: October Unemployment Rate\nNov. 30 9am: October Copper Production Total\nNov. 30 9am: October Retail Sales\nDec. 1 8:30am: October Economic Activity\nInternational\nUS\nNov. 27: New Home Sales\nNov. 28: Conf.

        "text": "\nTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) \u2014 Perhaps just shaking hands and sitting down together can be enough sometimes.\nAt their four-hour meeting Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping didn't resolve any of the vital geopolitical issues dividing the world's two largest economies and chief rivals for global influence, but they struck a conciliatory tone that came as a relief to other countries, especially China's neighbors.\nThe two leaders met at a northern California country estate, holding talks, lunching and taking a garden stroll designed to show that while the two countries are global competitors, they\u2019re not locked in a winner-take-all faceoff.\n\u201cPlanet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed,\u201d Xi told Biden.\nBiden emphasized the need to avoid miscommunication. \"We have to ensure competition does not veer into conflict,\u201d he said.\nThe leaders' first face-to-face encounter in a year appears to have put a floor under a relationship that at times has seemed to be in freefall over various issues, from trade and technology to U.S. support for Taiwan, China's human rights record and even the source of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTaiwan's Foreign Ministry appeared to welcome the warming of relations, noting the U.S. had again laid down the bottom line that China must use peaceful means in dealing with the self-governed island that Beijing claims as its own territory, to be taken by force if it deems it necessary.\n\"We express our affirmation and welcome for President Biden again making use of the venue of a meeting with the leader of China to again openly press the strict U.S. position insisting on peace in the Taiwan Strait,\" spokesperson Jeff Liu said.\nSouth Koreans watched the meeting with a mixture of hope and skepticism. Living with a growing nuclear threat from rival North Korea, the South primarily focuses on ensuring its security through its crucial military and diplomatic ally, the U.S. Seoul has chafed at Beijing\u2019s unwillingness to back stronger sanctions and pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs at the U.N. Security Council.\nBut South Korea's largest trading partner is China, and the Biden's administration's steps to restrict sales of advanced chip technologies to China set off furious lobbying to minimize the impact on South Korean semiconductor makers like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix.\nIn an editorial on Thursday, South Korea\u2019s Kookmin Ilbo newspaper said a meaningful improvement in U.S.-China relations would have major consequences to global supply chains and the \u201ccomposition of the new Cold War between North Korea-China-Russia and South Korea-U.S.-Japan.\u201d\nDuring this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, being held in San Francisco, Japanese officials have focused more on trying to arrange a meeting between Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Xi to help persuade Beijing to lift a ban on imports of Japanese seafood due to the release of treated wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant.\nSeafood exports are just one element in Tokyo's often fraught ties with China, where anti-Japan sentiment left over from before and during World War II is at times fanned to promote loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. Tokyo and Beijing have long feuded over ownership of unpopulated East China Sea islands and underwater mineral deposits.\nBefore leaving for California, Kishida told reporters a meeting with Xi had not yet been decided on.\n\"We plan to have various forms of communication,\u201d he said.\nBack in China, the state-run media curated Xi's talks with Biden to highlight China's stature as a global equal to the United States, said Madoka Fukuda, a professor of international politics and China studies at Tokyo's Hosei University.\n\u201cChina is stressing to its own people that the country is a global power that serves an important role in the international community, prompting their nationalism at home,\u201d she said.\nThe aura of goodwill generated by the meeting was marred somewhat, however, by a comment by Biden. When pressed by a reporter to say whether he trusted Xi, he said he believed in trusting but verifying, and conceded that China\u2019s leader is a dictator.\n\u201cHe is a dictator in a sense,\u201d Biden said.\nThat drew a stout response from a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, who said, \u201cSuch a remark is extremely wrong and is irresponsible political manipulation.\u201d\n\u201cIt needs to be pointed out that there have always been people with ill intentions who try to sow discord and undermine the China-U.S. relations,\" she said.\nMao reaffirmed China's position that the U.S. should not provide Taiwan with armaments or back its independent role in international affairs. But she affirmed that the meeting in San Francisco was an important step to \"enhance trust, dispel misgiving, control differences and expand cooperation between China and the U.S.\"\n\"It is also an important meeting to inject certainty and enhance stability into a turbulent and changing world,\" she said. \u201cBut San Francisco is not the end, and it should become a new starting point.\u201d\nBeijing residents asked about the meeting said they hoped for a relaxation of tensions with the U.S., where tens of thousands of Chinese students travel to study each year and an untold number have settled down for work.\n\u201cI feel that China-U.S. relations have eased, and maybe the next step will be cooperation,\u201d said Xu Jiaguang a 31-year-old firefighter. He echoed a comment by Biden that only by sitting face-to-face can potential adversaries find common ground and said he hoped the tete-a-tete would be \"a great help.\u201d\nTensions with the United States have the \u201cbiggest impact on ordinary people,\u201d said Gao Kexin, 23, a Beijing hospital worker. \"I hope the relationship can be eased, so that people can live a happier life,\u201d he said.\nWhile tensions appear to have cooled, the two sides remain in contention over which is calling the shots in the relationship, said Zhao Minghao, a professor of international relations at Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University.\n\u201cThe Biden administration has been attempting to exhibit that they are the dominator of the pace of China-U.S. relations, making the outside world feel that it is China that doesn\u2019t want to cooperate and communicate,\" Zhao said.\n\u201cThere has been a big change this time and China hopes to show that Beijing is committed to responsibly managing China-U.S. relations,\u201d Zhao said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Kim Tong-Hyung in Seoul, South Korea and video producer Caroline Chen in Beijing contributed to this report.",

        "text": "\nBy Jamie McGeever\nNov 9 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist.\nAttention in Asia on Wednesday turns to Chinese inflation data, with investors expecting disinflationary pressures to have picked up in October but not at such a pace that would deflate the recent rebound in optimism about the economic recovery.\nProducer and consumer price inflation figures will be released, the highlights of a regional calendar that also includes Japanese bank lending, trade and current account figures, Indonesian retail sales, and Philippines GDP. Asian markets open on Thursday to a fairly benign global backdrop. U.S. bond yields continue to slide, oil prices are the lowest since July - WTI crude is down 20% from its September peak - and Wall Street is resisting profit-taking pressure to hold onto its recent gains.\nA solid 10-year U.S. Treasury bond auction on Wednesday helped extend this week's sweeping rally that is driving yields down across the curve. Global yields are moving too - the 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield is back below 0.85%, having come within two basis points of 1% last week.\nThe decline in U.S. bond yields is removing some of the dollar's shine, which in turn is allowing Asian currencies to fight back. China's yuan this week, for example, is the strongest in more than two months, enjoying a reprieve from the heavy downward pressure of recent months.\nPeople's Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng said Beijing will resolutely guard against the yuan overshooting, according to a report in the Financial News, a newspaper owned by the PBOC, and a growing number of global asset managers may be taking more of a shine to Chinese assets.\nFigures on Thursday are expected to show annual producer price deflation accelerating slightly to -2.7% from -2.5% in September, snapping a run of three months of improvement. Annual consumer inflation is also expected to slip back to -0.1% from 0.0%. Another choppy day in China's property sector awaits after Ping An Insurance Group shares slumped to a one-year low on Wednesday after Reuters reported Chinese authorities had asked the firm to take a controlling stake in troubled developer Country Garden.\nIn Japan, meanwhile, among the big companies releasing their latest reports on Thursday are Nissan, Honda, Sony and the wider Softbank Group.\nThe yen remains vulnerable too, slipping further below the psychologically key 150 per dollar level. It is now trading near 151.00 per dollar and in sight of the 152.00 mark that many analysts think might be the threshold for direct yen-buying intervention from Japanese authorities.\nYen traders on Thursday are also eyeing Japanese bank lending figures for October and September's trade and current account report.\nThe Philippine peso will be highly sensitive to the country's third quarter GDP report. The central bank said on Oct. 26 that Q3 annual growth will likely be around 4.5%.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:\n- China PPI and CPI inflation (October)\n- Japan trade and current account (October)\n- Fed's Powell speaks\n(By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)",

The automaker provided a long-awaited update on pricing and specifications, estimating the base version will cost $60,990, up more than 50% from the cheapest option floated four years ago. It won\u2019t be available until 2025.\nTesla is taking reservations for that vehicle and two configurations that it will deliver next year, which cost an estimated $79,990 and $99,990. The version offering the most battery range will go about 340 miles on a charge, well short of the more than 500 miles the company touted four years ago.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more expensive than I thought,\u201d said Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cThey need to get production up to get the price down, and they know they can\u2019t produce a lot of them next year. The reality is that the Cybertruck isn\u2019t really out yet.\u201d\nTesla shares fell as much as 2.1% before the start of regular trading Friday. The stock climbed almost 20% last month in anticipation of the event, which was live-streamed on X, the social media platform Musk owns.\nThe Cybertruck marks Tesla\u2019s entry into the lucrative and highly competitive pickup market in the US, a move that\u2019s been met with a mix of excitement, criticism and doubt. One analyst suggested last week that the automaker should cancel the truck altogether, arguing it will be a drag on profit and divert resources. Musk himself has lamented that producing the pickup will be \u201cinsanely difficult.\u201d\nThe CEO mostly focused on the merits of the Cybertruck during the delivery event, in contrast to his emphasis on manufacturing challenges during Tesla\u2019s last earnings call. He did say that part of the reason for the pickup\u2019s angular shape is that its stainless-steel body panels can\u2019t be stamped, claiming they would break stamping machines.\nWhen Tesla started taking deposits for the Cybertruck in 2019, it marketed a starting price of $39,900 for a single-motor version and more than 500 miles of range for a tri-motor configuration. A demonstration of the pickup\u2019s transparent-metal glass went awry, with design chief Franz von Holzhausen shattering a window with a metal ball.\nThis time around, the Cybertruck withstood von Holzhausen throwing a baseball at the front passenger-side window. \u201cWe could probably have a pro pitcher lob it at it,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThe glass is tough, basically, is what we\u2019re saying.\u201d\nTesla claimed the Cybertruck will reach 60 miles per hour in as little as 2.6 seconds, and showed a video of the pickup crossing a quarter mile quicker than a Porsche 911 \u2014 while also pulling one of the sports cars on a trailer.\nThe company said the pickup can tow up to 11,000 pounds, more than a battery-powered Ford F-150 Lightning and some gas-powered F-150 models. The Cybertruck also boasts 17 inches of ground clearance, more than all versions of the F-150 and the electric Rivian R1T pickup.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically an incredibly useful truck,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just some grandstanding showpiece, like me.\u201d\nStill, the cheapest Cybertruck will be thousands of dollars more than the commercial grade electric F-150 \u2014 which starts at $49,995 \u2014 as well as the base retail model starting at $54,995.\nIn July, Musk posted on X that the F-150 Lightning was \u201ca good vehicle, just somewhat expensive.\u201d\nThe high-end version of Tesla\u2019s pickup, called Cyberbeast, will be able to get more than 440 miles of range by adding an additional toolbox-size battery against the back of the cab in the bed.\nTesla\u2019s Cybertruck website offers details Musk didn\u2019t get into during his presentation, including the size of front (18.5-inch) and rear (9.4-inch) touch screens and the number of speakers (15). The pickup also will offer bidirectional charging, meaning the battery can be used to power homes, power tools and other devices \u2014 including other EVs.\n--With assistance from Esha Dey.\n(Updates with early trading in the fifth paragraph.

CPI slightly cools * FX drop 1%, stocks down 0.5% By Siddarth S Nov 10 (Reuters) - Latin American assets marched southward on Friday and were set for weekly declines as risk appetite received a thumbs down after a hawkish rhetoric from the U.S. Federal Chair Jerome Powell fanned fears of further rate hikes. The MSCI's gauge for South American equities shed 0.5% by 1512 GMT and was set for weekly declines of 0.5%, if losses hold. A basket of regional currencies weakened 1.0% against a steady dollar and was on track for weekly losses of more than 1%. A bout of jitters ran through markets on Thursday after a weaker-than-expected 30-year bond auction and a hawkish message from Powell pushed the dollar and yields on 10-year Treasury bills higher. Fed officials including Powell said on Thursday they are still not sure interest rates are high enough to finish the battle with inflation. Latam stocks and FX had a flying start in the first week of November as markets started pricing in rate cuts next year following Fed's decision to keep rates steady last week and a less hawkish tone from Powell. The rally was short lived as things took a U-turn following hints of further rate hikes from Fed policymakers earlier this week and the hawkish tilt was cemented further by Powell's speech on Thursday. Andres Abadia, chief Latin America economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said despite the Fed having \"some sort\" of a hawkish view, they will continue to keep interest rates on hold. \"Market sentiment right now is that interest rates in the developed world would probably remain stable and we'll probably see interest rate cuts by the Fed in the spring and that will support Latam markets. That's the central view, less of all volatility in the near term,\" Abadia added. Brazil's October consumer prices slightly cooled as prices rose 0.24% just below market forecasts of 0.29%. Brazil's benchmark stock index Ibovespa climbed 1.0%, while the real inched up 0.1%. Chile's central bank is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate by another 75 basis points to 8.25% at its next monetary policy meeting next month, a poll of analysts released by the bank showed on Friday. Chilean shares slipped 0.2%. On Thursday, Peru's central bank again lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.00%, while Bank of Mexico held its benchmark interest at 11.25% as expected. Among corporate earnings, shares of Banco Bradesco fell 1.3% after a disappointing third-quarter results on Thursday. Emerging market debt funds suffered outflows in the past fifteen weeks, bleeding $53 million in the latest week ending Nov. 8, while EM equity funds lost $1.2 billion in investment flows, its fifth consecutive week of outflows, according to BofA Global Research. Down south, Argentina's pollsters say the Nov. 19 presidential run-off between radical outsider Javier Milei and government economy chief Sergio Massa could go either way, although Milei has a slight advantage.

        "text": "\nElon Musk\u2019s social media company X filed a lawsuit against liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America on Monday, saying it manufactured a report to show advertisers\u2019 posts alongside neo-Nazi and white nationalist posts in order to \u201cdrive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp.\u201d\nMedia Matters, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit, called the lawsuit \u201cfrivolous.\u201d\nAdvertisers have been fleeing the site formerly known as Twitter over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content \u2014 and hate speech on the site in general \u2014 while billionaire owner Musk has inflamed tensions with his own posts endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory.\nIBM, NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast said last week that they stopped advertising on X after the Media Matters report said their ads were appearing alongside material praising Nazis. It was a fresh setback as the platform tries to win back big brands and their ad dollars, X\u2019s main source of revenue.\nThe Media Matters report pointed to ads from Apple and Oracle that also were placed next to antisemitic material on X. On Friday, it said it also found ads from Amazon, NBA Mexico, NBCUniversal and others next to white nationalist hashtags.\nBut San Francisco-based X says in its complaint filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, that Media Matters \u201cknowingly and maliciously\u201d portrayed ads next to hateful material \u201cas if they were what typical X users experience on the platform.\u201d\nX's complaint claims that Media Matters manipulated algorithms on the platform to create images of advertisers' paid posts next to racist, incendiary content. The juxtapositions, according to the complaint, were \"manufactured, inorganic and extraordinarily rare.\"\nIt says Media Matters did this by using X accounts that just followed X users known to produce \u201cextreme fringe content\u201d and accounts owned by X\u2019s major advertisers. This, the complaint says, led to a feed aimed at producing side-by-side placements that Media Matters could then screen shot in an effort to alienate X's advertisers.\nMedia Matters said Monday that it stands by its reporting and expects to prevail in court.\n\u201cThis is a frivolous lawsuit meant to bully X\u2019s critics into silence,\" the non-profit's president, Angelo Carusone, said in a prepared statement.\nMeanwhile, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced his office is launching an investigation into Media Matters for possible fraudulent activity related to the group\u2019s report.\nAdvertisers have been skittish on X since Musk's takeover more than a year ago.\nMusk has also sparked outcry this month with his own posts responding to a user who accused Jews of hating white people and professing indifference to antisemitism. \u201cYou have said the actual truth,\u201d Musk tweeted in a reply last Wednesday.\nMusk has faced accusations of tolerating antisemitic messages on the platform since purchasing it last year, and the content on X has gained increased scrutiny since the war between Israel and Hamas began.\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino said the company's \u201cpoint of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should STOP across the board.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s something we can and should all agree on,\u201d she wrote on the platform last week.",

The company\u2019s 67.4 trillion won ($50 billion) revenue for the last quarter was a 12.2% drop from a year earlier.\nSamsung said the operating losses from its semiconductor business fell from 4.36 trillion won ($3.2 billion) in the second quarter to 3.75 trillion won ($2.78 billion) for the July-September period.\nIt said the improvements in demand have been driven by high-end chips used for artificial intelligence technologies and resumed orders from PC and mobile device manufacturers, which had previously focused on lowering their chip inventory while weathering weak consumer spending.\nIt also said it expects to spend a record 53.7 trillion won in capital expenditure this year, including 47.5 trillion won on chips, to prepare for mid-to-long term demand increase.\n\u201cOverall memory demand is expected to recover gradually thanks to increasing demand for AI and normalizing inventory levels at customers, but various factors that can affect the server market \u2014 such as geopolitical issues and spending trends that are related to macroeconomic conditions and centered on generative AI \u2014 need to be continuously monitored,\u201d Samsung said in a statement.",

The figures missed expectations for a gain of 25,000 positions and a jobless rate of 5.6% in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\nWage growth for permanent employees slowed to 5%, missing expectations for a 5.2% gain, but still the fourth straight month of pay raises of 5% or more.\nThe loonie rose to session highs after the release of both Canadian and US employment data, up 0.2% to 1.3705 at 8:45 a.m. in Ottawa. The yield on Canadian government two-year bonds fell as much as 10 basis points.\nThe data paints a clearer picture of an economy that\u2019s gearing down, with the pace of job gains running below labor force growth from record population increases. It\u2019s another sign labor demand is cooling while supply is catching up quickly. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem expects the economy to move into modest excess supply in the fourth quarter, helping to slow consumer price inflation.\nMacklem and his officials paused their interest-rate increases for two straight meetings in September and October, and over that period several data releases point to an economy that\u2019s rapidly slowing, despite persistent underlying price pressures. Policymakers are counting on a weaker economy to help ease inflation in the coming months as they wait and watch.\n\u201cThis keeps the BoC very much sidelined into 2024, but we\u2019ll need to see further softening to see rate cut talk ramp up,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, a rates and macro strategist at the Bank of Montreal, said by email.\nEarlier this week, preliminary industry-based data suggested gross domestic product was flat in September, pointing to a 0.1% annualized decline in output for the third quarter. That would follow a 0.2% contraction from April to June, based on expenditure-based data.\nIn October, total hours worked were unchanged on a monthly basis and up 2.1% compared to a year earlier. That also points to relatively weak momentum at the beginning of the fourth quarter, when economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect GDP to expand at a 0.1% annualized pace.\nRate Expectations\nThis is the first of two jobs reports before the Bank of Canada\u2019s next decision on Dec. 6. A majority of economists expect Macklem to hold the overnight rate steady at 5%, a likely end point in this tightening cycle.\nTraders in overnight swaps brought forward their expectations for when the Bank of Canada will start loosening policy, and are now betting policymakers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points in July, from September a day ago.\nCanada is experiencing record population growth due to high levels of immigration. Since January, employment growth has averaged 28,000 per month, while growth in the population aged 15 and older has averaged 81,000 per month.\nThe participation rate held steady at 65.6%. The employment rate \u2014 the proportion of the working-age population that\u2019s employed \u2014 fell 0.1 percentage point to 61.9% in October, as the population aged 15 and older increased by 85,000, or 0.3%.\nJob gains were led by increases in construction, information and recreation, and the health care sector. Wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing and real estate industries saw the biggest losses.\nEmployment rose in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but it fell in Quebec and was little changed in the other provinces.\n--With assistance from Chris Middleton and Carter Johnson.\n(Updates with market and economist reaction.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nShipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\nFoxconn Makes Your iPhone.

The first of five lines at the 325,000-square-foot plant began production in mid September, about two years after construction began, and a second line was put into service earlier this month.\n\u201cThis brand new Danville facility represents a pivotable move in our company\u2019s history,\u201d Tyson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Donnie King said Tuesday at a ribbon-cutting event at the plant. \u201cIt represents a strategic growth drive, which is key for us as we continue to build positive momentum and drive profitability in our business.\u201d\nTyson is seeking to expand its value-added business, which is typically seen as more resilient in economic downturns, as part of efforts to accelerate long-term growth.

Among the factors behind the move was an improving spread between 10-year Italian and German bonds, a key measure of risk in the region, said the people who asked not to be named on a confidential issue.\nSuccessive governments have long tried to find a way to sell a controlling stake in Paschi. The bank was first bailed out in 2009 after it was hit by souring loans and derivatives deals that backfired. In the following decade, it struggled to deliver consistent profit, given limited room for maneuver under terms set by the European Union.\nThe transaction allows the government to immediately cut Italy\u2019s debt mountain by \u20ac920 million ($1 billion) and came just hours ahead of assessments by the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive, on national budgets for 2024.\nAn official briefed on the matter said a key condition for kicking off the sale was Italy\u2019s latest budget and its financial management. Representatives for UBS and Jefferies declined to comment.\nThe finance ministry offered a 20% stake on Monday evening, after the market close. Demand turned out to be five times the size of that offer, prompting the government to boost the stake to 25%, the people said. Italy sold 314.9 million shares for \u20ac2.92 a piece, with a 5% discount on Monday\u2019s closing price.\nFollowing Monday\u2019s sale, Italy has shrunk its stake in Paschi from 64% to 39%, which could pave the way for creating a third Italian banking group, as planned by Meloni. A smaller state holding could facilitate an M&A deal.\nThe EU allowed Italy to nationalize Paschi, based in Siena in Tuscany, in 2017 on condition it be re-privatized with an initial deadline set for 2021. Meloni\u2019s predecessor Mario Draghi asked the EU to extend a deadline to sell the state\u2019s controlling stake to the middle of 2024.\nA turnaround under Chief Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio, after years of restructuring, has turned the bank into an asset and not a burden.\nEarlier this month, Paschi shares hit their record high since a \u20ac2.5 billion capital increase completed a year ago. Shares closed at \u20ac3.17 on Nov. 16, marking an increase of about 60% compared to the offer price of \u20ac2. The share sale was part of Lovaglio\u2019s turnaround plan.\n(Updates with Jefferies no comment in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nBy Rae Wee\nSINGAPORE, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on Wednesday to hit its lowest against the yen in more than two months and languished near a three-month trough against its major peers, as expectations mount the Federal Reserve could begin lowering rates by early next year.\nThe Australian dollar held near a four-month peak while the New Zealand dollar scaled a roughly four-month top of $0.61495 in early Asia trade. Australian inflation data is due later in the day, followed by a rate decision from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).\nThe greenback tumbled to 147.02 yen and pushed the euro back above $1.10 to last trade at $1.10025, after Fed Governor Christopher Waller - a known hawkish and influential voice at the central bank - on Tuesday flagged a possible rate cut in the months ahead.\n\"He's relatively hawkish, historically speaking, so if his attitude is turning a little bit more dovish, it sort of says that perhaps a general consensus of the board members is that rates have peaked and maybe could even be cut next year,\" said Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com.\nMarket pricing currently shows a 40% chance the Fed could begin easing monetary policy as early as next March, as compared to a roughly 22% chance a day ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the greenback slid to a more than three-month low of 102.60. The dollar index was eyeing a nearly 4% loss for November, its worst monthly performance in a year.\n\"We have become less constructive on the prospects for the U.S. dollar, as progress in reducing U.S. inflation suggests the risks are tilted toward earlier rather than later Fed easing,\" said economists at Wells Fargo in a note. \"Despite U.S. economic resilience, this should lessen the greenback's near-term gains.\"\nSterling last bought $1.27105, hovering near the previous session's roughly three-month high of $1.2715.\nThe Aussie gained 0.1% to $0.6656, not far from Tuesday's four-month top of $0.6666, as traders turned their attention to an inflation reading due later on Wednesday for clues on whether more rate hikes from the Reserve Bank of Australia are in the offing.\n\"In principle, if that inflation number comes in a little bit hot again, probably doesn't say that we'll get a hike in December, but it certainly puts greater focus on the next inflation print at the start of next year to gauge whether the RBA would need to go again in perhaps February,\" said Capital.com's Rodda.\n(Reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

It has approximately 800 locations in the United States and Canada, and has this year added $380 million to Berkshire's profit through September.\nBuffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting in May he wished he could have bought all of Pilot in 2017, but the Haslams did not want to sell.\nBerkshire also owns dozens of other businesses including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurer, and big stakes in Apple, Bank of America and other stocks.\nThe case is Pilot Corp v Abel et al, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 2023-1068-MTZ.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

The rise of seemingly more capable conversational tools like ChatGPT, powered by so-called generative AI, have highlighted the shortcomings of Amazon\u2019s software. Teams at the company are racing to infuse Alexa with more of those capabilities.\nThe shares rose about 1% at 10:07 a.m. in New York.\nAmazon, which avoided mass job cuts for most of its existence, began its largest-ever layoffs about a year ago, ultimately axing 27,000 corporate positions after a hiring spree during the pandemic left the company with too many people. The company deepened the layoffs when it announced another 9,000 layoffs in March, which Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said would land on the cloud services division, human resources, advertising and the Twitch livestreaming service.\nSince then, the company has continued to look for cost cuts, at times leading to more layoffs. Amazon recently eliminated jobs in its music division and video games unit, and shuttered its physical clothing stores.\nRausch said employees in the US and Canada set to be laid off would be informed Friday morning Seattle time. Employees in India will find out next week, and cuts in other countries may follow other timelines to allow for consultations with employee groups or other factors.\nThe technology news site GeekWire reported the job cuts earlier.\n(Updated with context on Alexa\u2019s struggles, Amazon shares, beginning in the fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Elsewhere in Asia, Chinese banks maintained their benchmark rates as they aim to boost liquidity and support lending.\nHere are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy:\nEurope\nS&P Global\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index was in contraction again in November, hitting 47.1. While that\u2019s a bigger uptick than anticipated by economists, it marks the sixth consecutive month below the 50 level that marks expansion. Readings for both manufacturing and services showed a similar trend.\nGermany will suspend a constitutional limit on net new borrowing for a fourth consecutive year after Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s government was forced into a radical budget overhaul by a ruling last week from the nation\u2019s top court. The emergency move to lift the so-called \u201cdebt brake\u201d will be part of a revised 2023 budget that Finance Minister Christian Lindner plans to present next week.\nAsia\nChina may be done with rate cuts for now as policymakers turn to other means to support the economy and stabilize credit growth headed into the new year.\nSouth Korea\u2019s early trade data show exports are likely to maintain their growth momentum this month, continuing their rebound from a year-long slump and helping brighten the outlook for global commerce. Korea is a key global exporter, so its exports serve as a useful indicator of the health of the global economy.\nEmerging Markets\nThailand\u2019s economic growth unexpectedly slowed in the third quarter as manufacturing slumped on weak exports, supporting the case for the new government to proceed with its planned $14 billion cash handout program.\nChile\u2019s economy expanded more than forecast in the third quarter led by the mining sector, as the central bank started easing monetary policy. Gross domestic product rose 0.6% in the July-September period from a year earlier.\nIn what will be a marathon month for interest-rate decisions in Africa, its biggest economies are set to keep interest rates higher for longer. Angola and Zambia hiked this week to temper stubborn inflation and stabilize the local currency, and Nigeria is expected to hike as well. South Africa maintained its current rate, and others including Morocco, Kenya and Ghana are seen doing the same.\nUS\nAmericans are increasingly tapping their retirement savings to cover housing and medical bills amid higher cost-of-living pressures, according to data from Fidelity Investments. Some 2.3% of workers took a hardship withdrawal last quarter, up from 1.8% a year earlier.\nUS mortgage rates dropped sharply, capping the biggest four-week slide in nearly a year and spurring a fresh round of applications to purchase homes.\nWorld\nChina and Saudi Arabia have signed a local-currency swap agreement worth around $7 billion, deepening their ties as countries across the Middle East look to shift more of their non-oil trade away from the dollar.\nThe shock that rippled through global housing markets as central banks rapidly raised interest rates last year has given way to a cold new reality: The real estate bonanza that fueled wealth for millions of people is over.\nHungary\u2019s central bank cut its main interest in line with guidance, resisting government pressure for a bolder move in lowering the European Union\u2019s highest borrowing costs. Sri Lanka and Paraguay also cut. Turkey\u2019s central bank hiked interest rates by double the amount markets expected, while Sweden and Indonesia left rates unchanged.\n--With assistance from Fahad Abuljadayel, Ari Altstedter, Carolina Gonzalez, Prashant Gopal, Sam Kim, Kamil Kowalcze, John Liu, Yujing Liu, Michael Nienaber, Reade Pickert, Pathom Sangwongwanich, Zoe Schneeweiss, Alex Tanzi, Ainsley Thomson, Monique Vanek, Alexander Weber and Suttinee Yuvejwattana.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Some have turned to domestic chipmakers such as Huawei Technologies, in a trend analysts have called a threat to Nvidia's lead.\nReuters reported last week that Tencent rival Baidu has ordered 1,600 Huawei Ascend 910B chips.\nTencent has a stock of H800 AI chips that Nvidia developed specifically for China last year in response to earlier export curbs - but the new rules cover those too.\nIt said one way to best utilise its H800 chips is to reserve them for the most crucial part of AI model development, which is the training of the model.\n\"We'll try to see whether we can offload a lot of the inference capability to lower-performance chips so that we can retain the majority of our high-performance AI chips for training purposes,\" Lau said.\nNvidia plans to market new China-bound AI chips, with an announcement on Nov. 16 at the earliest, industry newsletter SemiAnalysis reported last week.\nThe chips are equipped with most of Nvidia's newest features for AI work but have reduced computing power to comply with the new rules, SemiAnalysis said.\nNvidia declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Jane Merriman and Christopher Cushing)",

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an unchanged reading of 48.7.\nSterling jumped against the dollar and the euro, while British government bond prices fell and markets pushed back bets on when the Bank of England will start to cut interest rates.\n\"Relief at the pause in interest rate hikes and a clear slowdown in headline measures of inflation are helping to support business activity, although the latest survey data merely suggests broadly flat UK GDP in the final quarter of 2023,\" Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence said.\nTotal new orders declined for the fifth month in a row, which S&P Global said reflected a persistently weak economy.\nThe PMI chimed with other measures of Britain's economy that indicate stagnating growth.\nBritain's economy has suffered from the highest inflation rate among big, rich countries and gross domestic product failed to grow in the third quarter. But the pace of price growth slowed more than expected to 4.6% in October.\nThe Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold at its last two meetings after 14 increases in row. But it has warned that inflation could be more persistent than expected, citing upside risks.\nGovernor Andrew Bailey this week suggested interest rates could remain higher for longer than priced by investors.\n\"Today\u2019s release will add to the Bank\u2019s unease about the stickiness of inflation,\" said Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics.\nWhile the PMI for the services sector was in positive territory at 50.5, the manufacturing sector came in at 46.7, a six-month high but still signalling a decline in output.\nA separate survey from the Confederation of British Industry published on Wednesday showed the biggest fall in factory orders since January 2021.\nS&P's survey respondents reported a slight uptick in already substantial input cost inflation, and noted \"strong\" wage growth which pushed up the average prices they charged.\nOverall, while firms were more upbeat about their prospects for the year ahead, forward-looking indicators showed recession risks were likely to remain elevated next year.\nEuro zone PMI released earlier on Thursday showed the region's downturn eased slightly in November, but suggested the bloc's economy was still likely to contract this quarter.

Price pressures continued easing across almost all categories and remained at a two-year low.\nA core measure that excludes volatile components including fuel and food moderated for a fourth month, to 3.6%.\nInflation is undershooting analyst expectations across the 20-nation euro area following the ECB\u2019s unprecedented ramp-up in interest rates. Output is waning as well, however: Gross domestic product shrank 0.1% in the third quarter, leaving the region teetering on the brink of a recession.\nFigures earlier Thursday showed those two trends playing out in France, prompting money markets to bring forward wagers on the ECB lowering borrowing costs. They now fully price a quarter-point cut by April, compared with June just over a month ago.\nMarkets are betting on four quarter-point reductions in 2024 \u2014 up from three last week \u2014 and are assigning a 70% chance of a fifth, which would bring the deposit rate back to 2.75% from a record 4% currently.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\u201cThe lower-than-expected reading on euro-area inflation should confirm for the ECB that price pressures are falling and that it can afford to not hike interest rates again.

Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said it\u2019s premature to even mention cuts.\nIndeed, inflation is likely to tick higher before returning to target due to statistical effects and the wind-down of measures deployed last year by governments to offset soaring energy prices.\nPresident Christine Lagarde has warned price gains may quicken \u201cslightly\u201d in the coming months and Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Nowcast for December points to a reading of 3.2%.\nThere are also question marks over how much of the rapid policy tightening \u2014 450 basis points of rate hikes in little over a year \u2014 is still to hit the economy.\nThe process is clearly visible in the financial sector, with lending to firms last month showing a first annual drop since 2015. A real estate boom underpinned by rock-bottom rates has also come to an end. Austria\u2019s Signa became a prominent casualty when the centerpiece of the sprawling property and retail group filed for insolvency this week.\nThe labor market has been holding up, however, with separate numbers Thursday showing euro-area joblessness staying at 6.5% in October.\nBut in his debut speech on monetary policy, Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta cautioned the ECB against needlessly harming the economy.\n\u201cDisinflation is well under way,\u201d he said in Rome. \u201cWe need to avoid unnecessary damage to economic activity and risks to financial stability, which would ultimately jeopardize price stability.\u201d\n--With assistance from Joel Rinneby, Barbara Sladkowska, Constantine Courcoulas, Andrej Sokol (Economist), Alessandra Migliaccio and Craig Stirling.\n(Updates with Bloomberg Economics.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

        "text": "\nIn 2022, Brazilian oil and gas company Petrobras had 68 places staked out for oil exploration off the South American coast, searching for new reserves while spending $6.9 billion in oil development projects. About the same time, Algeria-based Sonatrach proclaimed its ambition to ramp up production to become a top five national oil company by 2030. And Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. opened 68 new gas stations in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, noting in its 2022 annual report that there were now more than 500 across the UAE.\nAll these companies, along with 33 others focused on oil and gas, sent delegations to Egypt for last year's annual climate summit, known as COP27, aimed at moving the world away from the burning of fossil fuels like oil and gas. Many will likely be at the upcoming conference, COP28, being hosted in the UAE, which appointed Sultan al-Jaber, chairman of the nation\u2019s oil company, as president of the summit.\nFaced with criticism about their presence at negotiations, leaders of such companies argue they are part of the transition to renewable energies, an argument that negotiators like U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry have cautiously endorsed. But an Associated Press review of how much these companies invest in green energies, along with the priorities laid out in their annual reports, cast doubts on genuine commitments to transition.\nMost companies only have small, if any, investment in solar or wind power, the most established green technologies. Most of their investments, billions of dollars, are in further exploration, extraction and refining of oil \u2014 with plans laid out in some cases over the next decades. That's long beyond when scientists say the world must move away from fossil fuels.\n\u201cThese are companies with enormous profits at present, enormous engineering capabilities and have been producing oil and gas for a very long time,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cIt is reasonable to expect leadership in how quickly they lead and move and develop new technologies and drive the cost down\u201d of renewables.\nThe companies at last year's summit don't look to be making such efforts in any big way. Many that publish annual reports have sections entitled \u201csustainable\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d that do include some renewables. However, in such sections they also include biofuels, hydrogen development and carbon capture, all things that at best have long-term potential to reduce emissions. Many also tout natural gas which, while cleaner-burning than fuels like coal, still emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\nAlmost all the companies focus on reducing emissions in their operations, and don't address the emissions that will result when customers use their products to power cars, heat homes, move ships and planes, and so forth.\nThose emissions are known as \u201cScope 3\u201d and they are commonly seen as both the biggest share of a company\u2019s emissions and the most difficult to solve, with many companies arguing they are out of their control. (Scope 1 refers to a company\u2019s direct emissions, and Scope 2 are indirect emissions that come from production of the energy a company acquires to use in its operations.)\nAmir Sokolowski, global director of the Climate Change Team at CDP, a nonprofit that asks companies to disclose their climate impact, said fossil fuel companies are reluctant to take on emissions from their products after they\u2019re out the door.\nBut that reluctance isn't rational \"because the point is that oil and gas cause most of the combustion in the world in terms of emissions,\u201d Sokolowski said.\nPetrobras, majority-owned by the Brazilian government, specializes in deep water exploration, drilling and extraction. Its 2023-27 strategic plan earmarks $4.4 billion in investments \u201cto strengthen our low carbon position.\" Petrobras\u2019 planned investments in crude oil exploration and production for the period are more than 10 times higher than its low-carbon investments, according to the World Benchmarking Alliance, which tracks companies on sustainability goals.\nMeanwhile, the company's commitment toward those core products is clear. The scores of exploratory leases and billions invested in searching for new oil deposits fit a strategy that expects oil and gas production \u201cwill still be necessary to guarantee the energy security of Brazil and the world in the coming decades,\u201d the company says on its website.\nSixteen of the oil companies that went to last year\u2019s climate summit have publicly responded in recent years to questionnaires prepared by CDP, which invites companies and countries to be transparent about what they\u2019re doing on carbon and the climate. One question was how much of their spending was aimed at helping with the global goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times, which scientists warn is necessary to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, like increasing extreme weather events.\nEquinor, a Norway-based oil and gas company, answered in 2022 that 11% of its capital spending could be classified this way, with a goal of 30% by 2025. Notably, Equinor was also one of a minority of companies with a plan to tackle Scope 3 emissions -- those caused by consumers\u2019 use of its products \u2014 to get to net zero emissions by 2050.\nEquinor's plan includes a big focus on renewables. The company is building out the world's largest offshore wind farm, aimed at powering 6 million British homes one day. But the plan also depends on carbon capture and carbon offsets, or the equalizing of emissions by paying to capture them somewhere else. Equinor also says it will be necessary to continue to produce oil and gas \u201cfor the foreseeable future,\u201d in part to avoid global shocks.\nAl-Jaber\u2019s company, ADNOC, earlier this year began using drones to scatter mangrove seeds across Abu Dhabi, part of what it touted as a sustainability effort to plant some 2.5 million of the carbon-storing plants. Yet the company's investment in low-carbon projects amounts to just 10% of its reported plans for $150 billion in capital spending through 2027.\nADNOC, Petrobras, Equinor and Sonatrach declined or did not respond to interview requests to talk about their energy transition plans.\nSome companies in developing nations underscored the tension between the importance of oil and gas to their national economies and the industry's contribution to climate change, which can hit their countries harder than the developed world.\nUganda National Oil Co. in August announced formation of the Alliance for Climate Resilience to Combat Climate Change, an effort it said would include things like planting millions of trees, decarbonizing industry and shifting to cleaner cooking methods, with hopes to attract other East African nations to join.\nBut Uganda National was among companies whose plans for renewable energy were aimed primarily at using the clean power to decarbonize its fossil fuel projects, not replace them with cleaner pursuits.\nProscovia Nabbanja, the company's chief executive, referenced the difficult transition in an essay titled \u201cAdvancing Equitable Clean Energy in Developing Nations.\u201d Nabbanja noted pressure on nations like hers \u201cthat have not benefited from significant industrial and economic growth but are now expected to reduce emissions at the expense of their own development.\u201d She said wealthier nations have to lend money and technology to help developing nations with an \u201cequitable energy transition.\u201d\nPeter Muliisa, the company's general counsel, said that as a developing country, Uganda has low emissions relative to other nations. He also argued that it should be up to countries, not companies, to control Scope 3 emissions.\n\u201cIt is very hard for companies to plan for Scope 3 emissions, to put them in their plans,\u201d Muliisa told the AP.\nRegardless of who is responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas, in notes to investors some of the companies strike a reassuring tone about fossil fuels' durability. In its 2022 annual report, Chevron noted that while the future was uncertain, many outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant energy source while lower-carbon alternatives are incorporated.\n\u201cThe company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers' and consumers' demand,\u201d said the report.\n___\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

        "text": "\nBy Howard Schneider\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Banks tightened lending standards for U.S. businesses and households in the third quarter, but the pace of change appeared to ease, and demand for loans fell broadly in a sign of the impact higher interest rates are having on the economy, the Federal Reserve reported on Monday.\nThe tightening of standards for business loans applied to firms of all sizes, the U.S. central bank said in its latest survey of senior bank lending officers, while consumers faced tighter credit for home and home equity loans, credit cards, and tougher terms on auto loans.\nDemand for loans fell broadly, with 60% of banks citing moderately or substantially weaker demand for home mortgages in the third quarter, up significantly from 43% in the second quarter, as the Fed's aggressive rate increases since March of 2022 continued to bite on the residential housing industry.\nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate home mortgage rose sharply through the summer and fall, and at more than 7.7% has hit levels not seen in nearly a quarter of a century.\nThe detailed responses of the survey, fielded quarterly by the Fed and part of the data presented by staff to policymakers, did suggest, however, that the pace of credit tightening may be easing as the central bank's rate increases reach a likely plateau in the nearly 20-month-old tightening cycle.\nThe Fed has kept its policy rate steady in the 5.25%-5.50% range since July, and many analysts feel it is unlikely to go higher.\nWhile more than half of banks reported tightening business lending standards in the second quarter, just 35% said they cranked down further in the third quarter, with about 62% keeping standards the same. One bank reported easing standards slightly.\nAsked about the reasons for why standards may have shifted, bankers were also less likely in the third quarter to cite concerns about the overall economy or their own banks' financial position, and more likely to point to lower risk tolerance and the ability to resell loans in the secondary market.\nDemand for commercial and industrial loans weakened most among small firms, with more than half of banks saying credit demand had fallen among firms with annual sales of less than $50 million. About 39% of bank loan officers said loan demand had fallen among larger firms in the third quarter, compared to nearly 60% in the second quarter.\nFor households, 86% of loan officers said they had kept standards for home mortgages about the same in the third quarter, though 12% said standards had gotten tighter. Just over 5% of banks said they had tightened standards in the second quarter.\nAnalysts said the survey results were consistent with an expected economic slowdown in the final months of the year.\n\"The survey continued to show tightening lending standards and decreases in demand across the major reported loan types that look broadly consistent with an economy that should be slowing,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at J.P. Morgan.\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)",

        "text": "\nFlorida Realtor Alexandr\u00e9 Worthington is already bracing for a shift that threatens a tear down a compensation system that has ruled his industry for more than a century.\n\"It's the perfect time to pick up the pieces,\" Worthington said. \"It's a perfect time to reflect on the changes that could be coming and how to prepare for them.\"\nSubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.\nIn a federal civil case, a Kansas City jury last month found the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and major brokerages conspired to keep commissions artificially high. The result has left the real estate industry holding its collective breath, as experts say it is on the cusp of a radical reorganization that could affect everything about the business.\n\"There's a lot of speculation out there around how this will play out,\" said Ryan Tomasello, who covers the real estate technology sector for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Although much remains uncertain, \"we have a high degree of confidence that, at the conclusion of this storyline, significant changes will be made to the commission structure in the U.S.\"\nThe most immediate and striking blow could come as a result of the federal case in Kansas City, Mo. The judge overseeing the case has the power to issue an injunction that could break up the century-old \"bundled\" or \"cooperative\" commissions system, in which sellers' and buyers' agents split a commission that typically ranges between 5 and 6 percent of the home sale price. The timing of such an action remains unclear.\nA settlement in which NAR agrees to change the system is also possible, according to Michael Ketchmark, the lead plaintiff attorney. \"We're in the process of having conversations with the [Justice Department] and NAR, and we remain hopeful that we're going have a resolution that brings relief to millions across the county,\" he told The Washington Post.\nIn 2019, a group of home sellers sued NAR and brokerages Keller Williams and HomeServices of America in the Kansas City federal court, accusing the organizations of conspiring to keep commissions artificially high by requiring sellers to make the cooperative commission offer before listing homes on a widely used property database - the Multiple Listings Service - that allows for-sale properties to receive notice. The plaintiffs alleged that the system stifled competition and inflated commissions for buyers' agents.\nNAR, Keller Williams and HomeServices of America have denied those allegations and vowed to appeal the Oct. 31 verdict that awarded $1.8 billion to a half-million Missouri home sellers, an amount that could swell to $5 billion. Those organizations say the existing commissions structure is transparent, and they denied that the payment structure was anticompetitive. NAR said after the verdict that the \"matter is not close to being final.\"\nMantill Williams, an NAR spokesman, said the association is open to a resolution that \"maintains a way for buyers and sellers to continue to benefit from the cooperation of real estate professionals and eliminates our members' risk of liability for the claims alleged.\"\n\"That being said,\" he added, \"we remain confident we will prevail on our appeal.\"\nBut the verdict has already sent convulsions through financial markets and the real estate industry.\nShares of Zillow plunged nearly 7 percent after the jury rendered its verdict, as investors saw potential changes as a threat to the company's revenue model - a large portion of which comes from advertising for buyers agents, according to analysts. During an earnings call a day after the jury verdict, Zillow chief executive Richard N. Barton sought to reassure Wall Street analysts that buyers agents would not go extinct and that the company's revenue model was safe.\nHe added that possible developments to the commissions system \"look like good initial steps at more transparency and education for consumers,\" though added that he believed any change would come slowly.\nChanges to the commissions structure could eventually result in a 30 percent reduction in the $100 billion total that U.S. consumers pay in real estate commissions, according to a report by Tomasello and his team. Analysts and real estate experts said prices for buyers' agents would adjust more accurately to the value of their services. If buyers' agents are no longer guaranteed 3 percent of the commission, their fees might fall because they would have to compete on the price of their services, experts said.\nWorthington, the Florida Realtor, said buyers' agents could shift to an \"a la carte\" service model, in which potential home buyers choose their level of service and pay accordingly. A 1 percent commission, for example, could buy a customer automated emails with new homes for sale, based on the preferences of a prospective buyer, he said.\nFor a 3 percent commission, \"I'm actually going to walk into my office every morning and scrub our system and every resource I have to find the house that you're looking for,\" he said.\nSophia Gilbukh, an assistant professor of real estate at Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business in New York, said breaking up the buyers' and sellers' agent commissions could also result in lower listing prices for homes.\nHigh fees borne by sellers result in higher listing prices, Gilbukh said, because sellers want to cover their costs. Higher prices increase mortgage payments for buyers, she said.\nBreaking up the commission system, Gilbukh said, would result in lower prices overall but also lead to bigger upfront costs for buyers, who indirectly pay the costs of the commissions in the form of higher mortgage payments. Without the structure of the current cooperative system, buyers would need to directly pay their agents immediately after a sale.\n\"That might put a lot of buyers at a disadvantage, especially liquidity constrained buyers,\" she said. \"They might not be able to afford a higher-fee agent - even if it's worth it for them - because they just don't have the money to pay for it upfront.\"\nThe cooperative compensation structure was established in 1913, when National Association of Real Estate Exchanges, the precursor to NAR, said its member agents should share commissions with agents that produced buyers, according to a 2015 study by economists Panle Jia Barwick and Maisy Wong. The commissions rate hit 5 percent in 1940 and has remained virtually unchanged ever since, according to the study.\nCommissions work differently in countries such as the United Kingdom, where sellers pay typically less than 2 percent, and buyers pay their own agents, according to the study.\nU.S. regulators have long scrutinized America's commission system, Tomasello, the analyst, said. In 2020, the Justice Department sued NAR and proposed a settlement in which the association would have to change its rules to bring more transparency to its commission system. The settlement also sought to stop NAR from saying buyers' agent services are free. But less than a year later, the Justice Department withdrew from the settlement to \"permit a broader investigation of NAR's rules and conduct to proceed without restriction.\"\nThe Justice Department has also filed statements of interest in the Missouri case and a similar civil case in Illinois that clarify the parameters of a 2008 settlement between NAR and the Justice Department involving online listings. It did not respond to a request for comment on settlement negotiations in the Kansas City case.\nEchoing the Missouri and Illinois cases, a new group of Missouri residents filed a proposed lawsuit Oct. 31, alleging that real estate agents are conspiring to keep commissions high, restraining price competition and harming consumers in violation of federal antitrust laws. The lawsuit seeks damages for home sellers nationwide.\nCarole Higgins, a real estate agent in Suttons Bay, Mich., said changes are long overdue because agents have largely failed to appropriately explain contracts and commissions to consumers.\n\"We've grown so sloppy with the way that we are training our Realtors that this was the natural outcome,\" Higgins said of the lawsuits. This \"is a wake-up call.\"\nRelated Content\nPanda diplomacy to live on?

Its prediction for this year was in line with one issued by the government about a month ago, but next year's forecast was considerably gloomier than the 1.3% the government expects.\nIn their previous outlook in March, the experts had forecast that gross domestic product would grow 0.2% this year and 1.3% in 2024.\nThe panel's chair, Monika Schnitzer, said that \u201cthe economic recovery in Germany is delayed \u2014 it is ... still being slowed by the energy crisis and reduced real income caused by inflation.\u201d She noted that central banks' interest rate increases and economic weakness in China have made Germany's trading environment more difficult, while the high interest rates are dampening investment and construction at home.\nInflation in Germany has now fallen back to 3.8%, its lowest level since August 2021. People's real income should increase next year, leading to higher private spending and \u201ca cautious economic recovery,\u201d Schnitzer said.\nAs well as the current economic headwinds, Germany has been grappling with other issues such as an aging population, lagging use of digital technology in business and government, excessive red tape that holds back business launches and public construction projects, and a shortage of skilled labor.\nIn its annual report, the advisory panel suggested that the country's retirement age \u2014 which is currently being raised gradually to 67, a level it will reach in 2031 \u2014 be raised further in the future to take account of rising life expectancy.\nIt didn't offer specifics, but panel member Martin Werding pointed to a possibility of raising the retirement age by six months every 10 years so that it would reach 68 in mid-century.",

That addition freezes assets held in the United States and bars U.S. companies or citizens from trading with those listed, freezing them out of all dollar payments.\nSerdyukhov said the exchange's foreign intermediaries had demanded SPB carry out compliance.\n\"We were forced to suspend trading and now only settlements on transactions concluded before the sanctions were imposed are available to us,\" Serdyukhov said in a video message.\nThe bourse now has a queue of transactions from several days, but expects progress from Monday, said Serdyukhov.\nSPB is developing a process with international sanctions lawyers on how the shares will be delivered, the money transferred and in what currency. Details will be published in due course, said Serdyukhov.\nThe exchange last week said the sanctions would not affect clients' asset holdings, but Russia's central bank has warned that the SPB faces a serious challenge in finding long-term viability should foreign asset trading be diminished.\n\"We have always warned that owning foreign securities carries certain risks,\" Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said this week.\nShe estimated that about 80% of the volume of foreign shares was blocked.\nThe central bank is also assessing the readiness of Moscow Exchange, Russia's largest bourse, to deal with potential sanctions, Nabiullina said.

        "text": "\n(Updated at 15:00 EDT) By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields tumbled to three-week lows on Thursday as investors appeared more confident stepping into the market, continuing a rally from Wednesday on relief that the U.S. Treasury Department announced smaller-than-expected increases in longer-dated Treasury supply. Bonds have sold off in recent months on concerns about quickly growing bond supply after the Treasury surprised markets in late July with a higher-than-expected borrowing estimate. Investors have also repriced for the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates higher for longer as economic data remains strong. On Wednesday the Treasury said it would raise auction sizes for longer-dated debt by less than was expected and noted that it expects one more quarter of auction size increases to meet its financing needs. There\u2019s \u201cdefinitely a substantial rally now that we\u2019ve gotten on the other side of a bunch of key data points,\u201d said Zachary Griffiths, senior investment grade strategist at CreditSights in Charlotte. It seemed \u201cmore likely that the Treasury refunding would be the bigger driver of the move in yields this week, which I think is correct.\u201d The Fed also failed to deliver any hawkish surprises at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, which has given investors greater confidence to take advantage of higher Treasury yields. \u201cIt seems like the lower-than-expected supply, the Fed that\u2019s on pause for now, and the market is comfortable with hawkish signaling, but I think the press conference was more balanced - all of that on net is allowing Treasuries to rally after what\u2019s been a pretty wild move higher over the last three months or so,\u201d said Griffiths. Benchmark 10-year note yields were last down 12 basis points at 4.669% and earlier reached 4.626%, the lowest since Oct. 13. Thirty-year bond yields fell 15 basis points to 4.821% and got as low as 4.788%, the lowest since Oct. 16. They are on track for the biggest one-day yield move lower since March. Interest rate-sensitive two-year note yields were little changed on the day at 4.977% after earlier dropping to 4.914%, the lowest since Sept. 5. The inversion in the yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes deepened as far as minus 34 basis points, the most inverted since Oct. 18. \"The rally continues today as the market is jumping on the bandwagon and bullish momentum is seemingly taking hold,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities said in a note on Thursday, adding that the bank has entered a long 10-year note position in its model portfolio. This trade is based on expectations of a weaker payroll report on Friday and for data to weaken in the coming months, before a likely recession in the second quarter of 2024, he said. Meanwhile the Fed has likely ended its rate hikes, and it will be difficult for the market to price out all rate cuts, which should cap yield increases. The Treasury's smaller than expected increases in long-dated debt auctions also shows it is responsive to the market, which should help in the medium-term, TD said. Friday\u2019s employment report for October is expected to show that employers added 180,000 jobs during the month.

        "text": "\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A lighting technician is mowing lawns. A camera assistant is teaching guitar again. An actor has thought about shifting careers.\nFor more than a decade, work had been nonstop in Atlanta\u2019s booming film industry thanks to Georgia\u2019s extremely generous tax break. Dubbed the \u201cHollywood of the South,\u201d metro Atlanta became a ubiquitous backdrop for huge projects, including Marvel films and Netflix's \u201cStranger Things.\u201d\nAs soundstages sprouted up, the insatiable need for crews turned the city into a prime destination for both behind-the-scenes workers seeking to break into the entertainment industry and \"journeymen\" actors wanting a reprieve from the hustle of Los Angeles or New York. But work dried up last winter and has been at a near-standstill ever since the industry's writers went on strike in May and actors joined them in July.\nWriters reached a deal late last month, but with the actors strike still ongoing, countless Atlanta-based performers, as well as members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, are grappling for financial survival and with whether they\u2019ll even return to the industry.\nTHE CREW\n\u201cI wake up every morning and I\u2019m like, s\u2014-, I wish I could be on set right now,\u201d said Ed O'Hare, a 29-year-old set lighting technician who broke into the industry shortly after college by doing janitorial work at a local studio.\nO'Hare said he rose through the ranks thanks to his eagerness to learn the crafts, eventually discovering a passion for lighting. Fellow technicians quickly took him under their wing and helped him get hired on productions, including the Benicio Del Toro-led thriller \u201cReptile,\u201d despite his lack of experience: \u201cI've been told by multiple people that I couldn't have done that in L.A. or New York,\" he says.\nHaving now gone nearly five months without film work, O'Hare has been relying on a combination of savings, unemployment checks and odd jobs he's been doing for his grandmother's neighbors, including lawnmowing and pressure washing. It's been enough for him to scrape by, though he's also considering getting a bartender job like he had in college.\nIn the meantime, O'Hare has attended some classes hosted by IATSE, reuniting with industry colleagues as they brush up on technical skills and learn new ones, including soldering.\nThere's a recurring joke during the classes, O'Hare says. Whenever the instructor asks for questions, someone is always quick to respond with the key one: \u201cYeah, when are we going back to work?\u201d\nLike his union, which has held unity rallies, O'Hare said he supports the writers and actors for fighting for what they deserve. He hopes the actors will soon reach a deal, though a recent breakdown in negotiations had quelled some optimism. Even with a deal, O'Hare knows it could still be months before he's back on set.\nAlex Buhlig, 34, moved from Atlanta to LA in 2015 as an aspiring camera assistant. But all the calls he got kept coming from Georgia.\nBuhlig was back in Atlanta in less than a year, working primarily on commercial projects, independent movies and reality shows until 2017 when he joined IATSE \u2014 and was soon asked to work on the blockbuster \u201cGodzilla: King of the Monsters.\"\n\u201cA month prior to working on \u2018Godzilla,\u2019 I had been doing indie films whose entire budget was $10,000,\" Buhlig recalls, laughing. \u201cIt's a testament to how busy Atlanta was at the time.\u201d\nIn recent months, Buhlig, now a second camera assistant, has been relying on sporadic work commercial and music video work, but \u201cif the strike continues through next year, that's unsustainable.\u201d\n\u201cI've got to figure something else out,\u201d said Buhlig, who has also been piecing together hours as a guitar teacher, a job he's held in the past while \"trying to avoid doing the restaurant thing again.\u201d\nBuhlig says he recently had to pull some money from his pension since his bank account was running low but considers himself \u201cextremely fortunate\u201d since he has health care coverage and doesn't have a family depending on him.\nHe knows others are in tougher positions.\n\u201cThe strike will definitely push people out of the industry \u2014 it probably already has,\u201d Buhlig said. \"Because if you had just gotten started or you weren\u2019t working recently, I couldn\u2019t imagine going through something like this.\u201d\nTHE ACTORS\nDespite Atlanta's large role in the industry, the local chapter of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has only about 3,700 members \u2014 less than 3% of total membership.\nYet Atlanta's actors praise the sense of community and the relatively low cost of living \u2014 though affordability has taken a big hit in recent years.\n\u201cI have found more community here in the city of Atlanta (over the past five years) than I had in LA in 40,\u201d actor Ethan Embry told cheering rallygoers this summer.\nEmbry, who started as a child actor before starring in the teen rom-com \u201cCan't Hardly Wait\" and Netflix's \u201cGrace and Frankie,\u201d later told the AP: \u201cIt\u2019s not the same fight for survival that Los Angeles has. Everything in Los Angeles feels like a competition. Here, everything feels like you\u2019re in it together.\u201d\nBethany Anne Lind credits Atlanta's post-2008 filming boom with boosting her then-fledgling acting career, saying she likely got some small roles because studios didn't want to spend money to fly someone else out.\nBut now that she's more established, with a memorable supporting role in Netflix's \u201cOzark,\u201d Lind says it's been hard to land meatier parts. She feels Atlanta-based actors are frequently overlooked by casting agents who still focus on New York and Los Angeles talent pools.\nLind is a prominent speaker at local rallies, yet feels slightly envious of colleagues in Hollywood, who picket outside studios daily \u2014 Atlanta may have the second-most number of soundstages in the nation, yet picket lines are a rarity because studios are headquartered elsewhere.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very strange to see my friends in LA and New York getting out there, like sweating their faces off every day and not being able to be a part of that,\u201d Lind, who signed an open letter this week urging SAG-AFTRA not to accept \u201ca bad deal,\u201d says. \u201cThere would be something cathartic about being able to put my body into it that I think we do miss out on here.\u201d\nOver the summer, as she focused her energy on her children and vegetable garden, Lind began to contemplate whether she should shift careers.\n\u201cFor the first time in my almost 20-year career now, I\u2019m really trying to think about what else I can do that I could have some enjoyment from, but also just be a little bit more steady and then hopefully have the flexibility to act also,\u201d she told the AP then.\nYet by October, she was back onstage, having landed the lead role in a local production of the British play \u201c Home, I'm Darling.\u201d She isn't discounting potentially going back to school for something else \u2014 but doesn't know what that alternative would be.\nOnce the actors get a deal, Embry is optimistic that business will once again boom in Georgia's capital \u2014 though this time people will be \u201ctreated more fairly.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already made the investment in Atlanta,\" Embry said of the studios. \"They realize that Georgia has things that are special to Georgia. There\u2019s a reason they all come here, and it\u2019s not just the tax break. We have the talent, we have the scenery, we have all of the different landscapes that filmmakers are looking for.\u201d",

The nonprofit did not on Wednesday ask other manufacturers for the same commitment.\nIn March, Hershey Chief Financial Officer Steve Voskuil said his company was looking to reduce levels of lead and cadmium, saying the metals are elements in soil that can occur naturally in a chocolate product.\n\"We would love to eradicate it completely,\" Voskuil said.\nConsumer Reports said more than 75,000 consumers signed an earlier petition for Hershey to reduce heavy metals in its chocolate, and that it is now again petitioning the company.\nHershey referred a request for comment to the National Confectioners Association.\n\"Chocolate and cocoa are safe to eat and can be enjoyed as treats as they have been for centuries,\" said Christopher Gindlesperger, a spokesman for the trade group.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York Editing by Bill Berkrot and Helen Popper)",

That's nearly three times more than all acts against French Jews in 2022, the Interior Ministry says.\nIn a statement Thursday evening, France's Foreign Ministry pointed a finger of blame at Russia, saying a Russian network of bots whipped up controversy about the stars with thousands of posts on X, the platform previously known as Twitter. Bots are automated accounts programmed to mimic human users by generating messages or following users on social media, often for nefarious or malicious purposes.\n\u201cThis new operation of Russian digital interference against France testifies to the persistence of an opportunistic and irresponsible strategy aimed at exploiting international crises to sow confusion and create tensions in the public debate in France and in Europe,\u201d the statement said.\nIt said the bots were affiliated with a Russian network \u2014 Recent Reliable News, also identified as Doppelg\u00e4nger.\nThe Russian activity was detected by Viginum, a French state digital watchdog set up in 2021 after hackers targeted Emmanuel Macron 's successful campaign for the French presidency in 2017. The core mission of Viginum is to detect and analyze foreign digital efforts to influence online public debate in France.\nViginum determined that a network of 1,095 bots affiliated with RRN published 2,589 posts on X in under two weeks, \u201ccontributing to the controversy surrounding the stenciled Stars of David,\u201d the French Foreign Ministry said.\nViginum also found that the RRN network appeared to have been informed about the graffiti before other posters on X, the ministry said. It said RRN bots first posted about the stars on the evening of Oct. 28 \u2014 48 hours before other photos of the stars started to appear on X.\nThe European Union has identified RRN as a digital information manipulation campaign that has also disseminated propaganda in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nAs well as using fake accounts on social media, RRN has also employed fake web pages that mimic media outlets and government websites, and \u201cis part of a broader hybrid campaign by Russia against the EU and the member states,\u201d the Council of the EU said in a July announcement of sanctions against Russian individuals and entities deemed responsible for the campaign.\n___\nAP journalists John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.",

A handheld device that connects to the PS5 over WiFi launches next week.\nIndustry observers were surprised by the recent announcement that gaming chief Jim Ryan will step down next March with developer Bungie cutting staff amid widespread industry layoffs.\nThe Oct. 20 release of \"Marvel's Spider-Man 2\" offers cheer going into the key year-end shopping season, with five million units of the game sold at the end of that month, Sony said.\nRival Nintendo has scored a string of hits in recent months as the company continues to draw in gamers despite eschewing the cutting edge graphics Sony and Xbox maker Microsoft have pursued. Sony hiked its full-year sales forecast for the games unit by almost 5% to 190 billion yen and maintained its profit forecast.\nIn the second quarter profit was supported by higher sales of third-party games but impacted by an increase in hardware losses.\nSony's movie division will co-finance and distribute a live action adaption of Nintendo's iconic \"Zelda\" franchise, leading to analysts raising the possibility of further collaboration between two leading Japanese entertainment companies.\n\"Sony's strong distribution network and publishing track record could make it a strategic move for Nintendo,\" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note ahead of Sony's earnings.\nThe company maintained its full-year operating profit view at 1.17 trillion yen but raised its sales and net income forecast by 2% each.\nSony shares ended down 0.8% on Thursday ahead of the earnings report. They have climbed 32% so far this year. ($1 = 151.0600 yen) (Reporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Kim Coghill)",

The agency declined to name the other platforms that would be covered beyond GooglePay, ApplePay, PayPal and CashApp.\nApple, PayPal and CashApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment.\nThe proposal marks a long-anticipated and ambitious move by CFPB Director Rohit Chopra to assert the agency's full authority over Big Tech, a sector he has frequently criticized for privacy and competition issues.\nSince becoming director in 2021, Chopra has steadily increased CFPB scrutiny of the sector, seeking information in 2021 on how Big Tech companies use consumer data and last year launching an inquiry into their payments platforms.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Chopra said the tech sector had expanded into financial services traditionally provided by the closely regulated banking sector.\n\"Today's rule would crack down on one avenue for regulatory arbitrage by ensuring large technology firms and other nonbank payments companies are subjected to appropriate oversight,\" he said.\nIn a speech last month, Chopra said CFPB research had found tech giants collected vast amounts of consumer payments data with few limits, scant transparency and confusing corporate policies, putting consumers at risk of Chinese-style surveillance by the companies.\nSpeaking about Tuesday's proposal, senior CFPB officials said it was imperative to look into privacy compliance at these larger firms with a wealth of consumer data, noting that many of their business models focus on monetizing that data.\nRepresentatives of Big Tech companies have previously highlighted their efforts to protect consumer data.\nTuesday's proposal would apply to companies handling more than five million transactions a year. The agency said the rule would also foster competition by ensuring that both traditional financial players and the tech sector were equally subject to the same oversight.\nIn a statement, the Consumer Bankers Association called the proposal \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\"For a healthy, innovative, and competitive financial services ecosystem to function, consumers need to know that they are protected equally, regardless of who they do business with to meet their financial needs,\" said CBA President and CEO Lindsey Johnson.\nThe Electronic Transactions Association, representing banks, fintechs and big tech companies, said in a statement it wants \"to ensure the proposal achieves the goals of consumer protection and consistent application of public policy for all players.\"\nThe proposal is now subject to a notice-and-comment period expected to end in early 2024.\n(Reporting by Douglas Gillison and Hannah Lang in Washington; Additional reporting by Chris Prentice in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Mark Potter and David Gregorio)",

        "text": "\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The OPEC oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia and allied producers including Russia made another big swipe at propping up lagging crude prices Thursday, expanding some output cuts into next year and bringing up-and-coming oil supplier Brazil into the fold.\nLower oil prices have been a good thing for U.S. drivers, who have been able to fill their gas tanks for less money in recent months. But it\u2019s bad news for OPEC+ countries whose oil income bolsters their economies and who have faced setbacks in pushing prices higher despite initial fears that the Israel-Hamas war could affect oil flows.\nThe OPEC+ oil ministers came out of an online meeting with more than 2 million barrels per day in voluntary cuts through the first three months of next year and declared that Brazil would join the bloc in January, bringing one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing oil producers into an alliance that is trying to rein in global supply.\nHowever, sweeping cutbacks from OPEC+ and individual member countries since October 2022 have not made lasting changes to oil prices because of concerns about too much crude circulating in a weakening global economy, which could weigh on the thirst for oil for travel and industry.\nThe market even shrugged off the new move, though it amounts to roughly 2% of global supply.\nJorge Leon, senior vice president of oil market research for Rystad Energy, called it a \u201cbit of disappointing meeting\u201d for OPEC+ and a \u201cbittersweet\u201d one for Saudi Arabia in particular because it couldn't convince the whole group to commit to production cuts.\nThe market also was let down, because it \u201cwas likely expecting a deal covering the first half of next year,\" he said.\nOther energy experts saw the oil bloc's two-part solution for a lagging market more positively. Paul Tossetti, an executive director of S&P Global Commodity Insights, praised the \u201cimaginative ways\u201d of OPEC+ lately in dealing with market challenges from the Americas, climate change efforts and on other fronts.\nTaken together, the bloc's two moves Thursday serve to \u201cpreserve the unity of the group at a challenging time,\u201d Bhushan Bahree, another executive director at the group, wrote.\nSaudi Arabia led the deepening voluntary cuts Thursday, extending its reduction of 1 million barrels per day through March. It was followed by Russia, which is cutting 500,000 barrels per day of crude and refined oil products, and then Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman with smaller amounts.\nRussia wants higher oil prices to boost the main way it fills its war chest against Ukraine, while the Saudis have to earn nearly $86 per barrel to meet their planned spending goals, according to the latest estimate from the International Monetary Fund.\nSaudi Arabia is trying to fund an ambitious overhaul of the kingdom\u2019s economy, reduce its dependence on oil and create jobs for a young population.\nBut the international benchmark Brent crude has stayed in the low- to mid-$80 range in recent weeks and fell more than 2% to $80.91 a barrel following the meeting before settling at $82.83 Thursday. U.S. crude also dropped 2.5% to $75.90 before settling at $75.96 per barrel.\nThe expanded cuts were expected to keep crude prices in the same range of $80 to $85 a barrel for the first half of the year, Leon said.\nLower oil prices have allowed U.S. gas prices to fall or stay steady since Sept. 19, AAA said. Gas is averaging just below $3.25 a gallon, the motor club said, down about 7% from a month ago.\nBut that's still higher than when President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, when prices were averaging about $2.40 a gallon. High inflation has been a political challenge for Biden going into the 2024 election, prompting him to say this week that efforts to improve supply chains and reduce price pressures are a priority.\n\u201cPresident Biden is focused on prices for American consumers, which have been coming down steadily,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday after the OPEC+ meeting.\nU.S. oil production has hit records as OPEC+ has cut back, with producers outside the group expected to keep leading global growth in oil supply next year, the International Energy Agency said.\nFor instance, daily production in the U.S. averaged 13 million barrels a day in August, an increase of more than 1 million barrels from a year ago, according to the latest monthly figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nThe risk is growing that production cuts could reduce the influence of OPEC+ over oil supplies as other countries boost their output.\n\u201cThe kingdom is balancing the desire to keep prices high by limiting supply with the knowledge that doing so will lead to a further drop in overall market share,\u201d Leon said.\nBringing in Brazil, which the IEA also said has been producing record amounts of oil this year, would give the 23-member OPEC+ a leg up.\nAdding Brazil's oil would bring the amount of global production controlled by OPEC+ up to 62%, similar to the share held by the organization when Russia joined in the mid-2010s, Leon said.\nJos\u00e9 Chrispiniano, press secretary for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, said the invitation was under analysis.\n___\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.

Unlike her siblings and father, she is not a defendant in the case.\nThe lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, accuses Trump and his family businesses of manipulating real estate asset values to dupe lenders and insurers and embellish Trump's reputation as a successful businessman.\nJudge Arthur Engoron has already ruled that the conduct amounts to fraud and is now considering what penalties to impose.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and accused James and Engoron of political bias and \u201celection interference.\u201d\nDuring defiant and rambling testimony on Monday, Trump acknowledged that valuations for his properties were not always accurate but said the errors were not relevant to the financial institutions that used them to price deals.\nHis sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump testified last week that the financial documents at the heart of the case were not their responsibility, though emails and other documents showed they may have been more involved than their testimony indicated.\nIvanka Trump was originally a defendant until a state appeals court dismissed her from the case in June, saying she was not involved in any conduct over which James could sue.\nUnlike her brothers, she did not oversee the Trump Organization during their father's 2017-2021 term in the White House.\nIn a ruling that found Trump, his adult sons and 10 of his companies liable for fraud, Engoron described in scathing terms how the defendants made up valuations. His ruling could strip Trump's control of some of his best known properties, though that order is on hold during appeal.\nJames is seeking $250 million in fines, as well as restrictions that would prevent Trump and his adult sons from doing business in their home state.\nIn addition to this case, Trump is a defendant in four separate criminal cases, including two about his attempts to overturn Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.\nNevertheless, opinion polls show he holds a commanding lead over Republican rivals to face Biden next year.

        "text": "\nBy Ben Klayman\n(Reuters) - High interest rates are derailing the ambitions of climate regulators and automakers to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles, underscored Wednesday by the scrapping of a GM-Honda partnership and a warning from a battery maker.\nElectric vehicle sales are still growing strongly, but that demand is not keeping up with the expectations of carmakers and other companies that have invested billions of dollars in the EV space. Expectations for persistently higher interest rates has led companies to alter plans as they eye 2024 warily.\n\"EV demand next year could be lower than expectations,\" Lee Chang-sil, chief financial officer at South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution said on Wednesday, due to global economic uncertainty.\nAlso on Wednesday, Honda and General Motors announced they were ending a $5 billion plan to develop lower-cost EVs together just a year after announcing the effort. GM on Tuesday said it would focus near-term EV efforts on meeting demand rather than hitting specific volume targets.\n\"We're taking immediate steps to enhance the profitability of our EV portfolio and adjust to slowing near-term growth,\" GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts.\nInvestors have responded to the changed outlook. Over the last three months, the iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech exchange-traded fund has plunged more than 24%, far more than the 8.3% fall for the MSCI All-World Index, a proxy for global equities.\nEV sales are growing, however. They topped 300,000 units in the United States for the first time in the third quarter, according to a Cox Automotive report. They rose 14.3% in September in the European Union and 22% in China, the world's largest EV market.\nFALLING RAW MATERIAL PRICES\nTesla CEO Elon Musk raised the alarm last week in explaining why he was slowing plans for a Mexico factory.\n\"I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we're in,\" he said on Tesla's earnings conference call. \"As I just can't emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder for people to buy the car.\"\nOther automakers have sounded similar notes of caution.\nGermany's Volkswagen last week cut its profit margin outlook for the year, blaming negative effects for raw material hedges at the end of the third quarter. Some of those materials are used in EV batteries.\nLike many other industrial firms, carmakers hedge against commodity price swings, and with EV demand slowing, raw material prices have softened, including those used heavily in batteries.\nLithium prices have tumbled 67% so far this year based on spot lithium carbonate prices assessed by Fastmarkets. Prices of cobalt metal on the CME have slid 20% this year and more than halved since May last year.\nU.S. automaker Ford earlier this month said it would temporarily cut one of three shifts at the plant that builds its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, and in July slowed its EV ramp-up, shifting investment to commercial vehicles and hybrids.\nShares of Japan's Nidec logged their biggest decline in a decade and a half on Tuesday, tumbling more than 10% on investor concerns over the motor manufacturer's prospects in an increasingly tough Chinese market for EVs.\nThe Japanese motor manufacturer now expects a 15 billion yen ($100 million) full-year loss at its key e-axle business, rather than the profit it had previously seen. E-axle manufacture combines motors, gears and power-control electronics.\nChina's CATL, the world's largest battery maker for EVs, said last week that third-quarter profit rose 10.7%, its weakest quarter since the start of last year due to slowing demand and stiff competition.\nThe company's market share in China tumbled in September to the lowest in more than a year, data showed, underscoring the challenges it faces from smaller rivals and weakening demand.\n(Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit and David Gaffen in New York; additional reporting by Eric Onstad in London and Victoria Waldersee in Berlin; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

We have been actively engaging with the committee on how we can best contribute to this important industry discussion.\"\"\nWifredo Fernandez, the head of U.S. and Canada government affairs at X, said in a statement that the company has been working \u201cin good faith\u201d to participate because safety is the company's top priority. \"Today we are communicating our updated availability to participate in a hearing on this important issue,\u201d Fernandez said.\nDurbin and Graham said the committee remains in discussions with both Meta and TikTok and expects their CEOs, Mark Zuckerberg and Shou Zi Chew, to testify voluntarily.\nSocial media companies have faced criticism from lawmakers, regulators and the public for harms their platforms cause to children and teenagers. Most recently, Meta was sued by 41 states and Washington, D.C. for contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict teenagers to the platforms.\n___\nOrtutay reported from San Francisco.",

That's how we clear up misperceptions and avoid surprises.\"\nSullivan said Biden would go into the summit \"on a solid footing,\" having positioned the United States to be able to compete effectively at home and abroad and with \"the strongest recovery and lowest inflation of any leading economy.\"\nHe said Washington is looking for specific outcomes from the meeting and hoped to see progress in reestablishing military-to military ties with China and in combating the trade in fentanyl that has become a scourge in the United States.\nChina cut off military-to-military communications with the United States last year after a visit to Taiwan, a democratically governed island China claims as its own, by then U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi. Tense relations soured further when the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon in February.\nSullivan said communication between the militaries was the way to ensure competition did not veer into conflict and that China had been \"constructive\" on the issue in dialogue leading up to the summit.\n\"We will see what happens in San Francisco and the President will be able to report after the meeting, whether in fact, we've made progress on restoring military-to-military links,\" he said.\nBiden and Xi have known each other for more than a decade and have shared hours of conversation over six interactions since Biden's 2021 inauguration.\nHowever, they have met only once in person since then and Xi has not visited the United States since 2017. Analysts and officials say they will come to the table in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and garbled impressions of what the other is seeking.\nThe meeting is also expected to cover global issues from the Israel-Hamas war to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, North Korea's ties with Russia, Taiwan, human rights, artificial intelligence, as well as \"fair\" trade and economic relations, senior Biden administration officials said.\nSullivan said Biden would raise stability across the Middle East, adding that Beijing should share an interest in de-escalation there.\nBiden would make the point that Iran acting in an \"escalatory, destabilizing way\" was not in the interests of China, he said. \"And the PRC, of course, has a relationship with Iran, and it's capable, if it chooses, to of making those points directly to the Iranian government.\"\nLeaders from the 21-member APEC forum are due to gather in San Francisco from Wednesday until Friday and the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine have divided opinion among them.\nThe senior U.S. official for APEC, Matt Murray, told reporters on Monday that the U.S. was working hard to try to get a strong consensus statement from the leaders, but analysts say the divisions make drafting this difficult.\nSullivan said that at APEC Biden would put forward his economic vision for the region and speak about \"how the United States is the preeminent driver of inclusive, sustainable economic growth in the Asia Pacific.\" (Reporting by Steve Holland, Nandita Bose in Washington; Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Alistair Bell)",

        "date": "2023-10-30T19:54:46.000Z",
        "text": "\nBy Stephen Nellis\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple on Monday introduced new MacBook Pro and iMac computers and three new chips to power them, with the company saying it had redesigned its graphics processing units (GPU), a key part of the chip where Nvidia dominates the market.\nThe new computers and the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips were unveiled at an online event heavily focused on professional users.\nIn the U.S., the 14-inch MacBook Pro laptop will start at $1,599 and a 16-inch version starts at $2,499. The new iMac desktop with the M3 family of chips starts at $1,299. Some will be available next week, while others will not ship until later in November.\nApple has seen a revitalization in its Mac business, roughly doubling its market share to nearly 11% since 2020 when it parted ways with Intel and started using its own custom-designed chips as the brains of the machines, according to preliminary data from IDC.\nAs part of the focus on business users on Monday, it showed off a new secure screen sharing feature that would let them on their machines from remote locations.\nThe company's custom chips, which use design technology from Arm Holdings, have given its Macs better battery life and, for some tasks, better performance than machines using Microsoft's Windows operating system.\nUnlike other laptop makers that might combine a central processor unit (CPU) from Intel with a GPU from Nvidia, Apple has combined both parts in its Apple silicon chips, which the company claims gives it better performance than its rivals.\nApple's shakeup of the market has spurred Qualcomm to redouble its efforts to make Arm-based chips for Windows, announcing plans last week to release a chip that is both faster and more energy efficient than some Apple offerings. Reuters last week reported that Nvidia also plans to jump into the PC market as early as 2025.\nCORPORATE BUYING\nApple aimed the new machines squarely at designers, musicians and software developers, at one point highlighting that the way it users memory can be used by artificial intelligence researchers, whose chatbots and other creations are often constrained by how much data can be held in the computer's memory.\nApple also tweaked its overall lineup of computers in ways that could change the behavior of corporate buyers.\nWhile slashing the U.S. price of the new 14-inch MacBook Pro from $1,999 to $1,599, Apple appeared to have eliminated a cheaper $1,299 13-inch model of its MacBook Pro that was a big seller to businesses, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst at Creative Strategies.\nThat move will likely clarify the choice between the company's model lines, prompting choices between Apple's productivity-oriented MacBook Air models that top out at $1,299 or the new $1,599 starting price for MacBook Pro models.\nAt Apple, the Mac hit $40.18 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2022, or about 11% of its revenue. While that was up 14% from the previous fiscal year, sales this year have slowed along with the rest of the PC industry, which has suffered a post-pandemic slump.\nApple said the new chips would be the first for laptops and desktops that use 3 nanometer manufacturing technology, which will give the chips better performance for each watt of electricity used.\nApple did not name who is making the chips, but analysts believe it is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which uses the same technology to make chips for the top-end iPhone 15 models.\nThroughout the event, Apple executives compared the performance of the new MacBooks and iMac machines to older Apple machines with chips from Intel, playing up how much speed customers would notice by upgrading to devices with Apple's own chips.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Shivani Tanna and Jahnavi Nidumolu in Bengaluru and Peter Henderson and Sayantani Ghosh in San Francisco; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Jamie Freed)",

        "text": "\nOne of Jack Kellogg's main indicators is the volume-weighted average price (VWAP).\nThis shows the average price paid for shares and helps him gauge sentiment.\nHe only uses indicators as a rough guide but never trades solely on them, he noted.\nJack Kellogg began trading stocks right out of high school in 2017.\nFive years into his craft, he has already been exposed to various types of market conditions, including the stock market crash of 2020, the raging bull rallies of 2021, and the bear market of 2022. One thing he has learned through it all is to keep things simple and remain flexible.\n\"There's this acronym: KISS, keep it simple stupid. I don't think people need super fancy indicators to make money trading. I'm just using basic trend lines, support, resistance, volume, and those are all my indicators,\" Kellogg said. \"I think if you overcomplicate the indicators, it will actually throw off your trading because then you're trading more on the indicators than the actual price action.\"\nThis attitude has allowed him to become a versatile trader who takes both long and short positions when appropriate, which helped him to continue trading throughout the bear market of 2022. His tax returns, viewed by Insider, showed that he reported over $8 million in gains from day trading in 2020 and 2021. His returns gained momentum in 2020 when he had a total income of $1.6 million. In 2021, that amount grew to a total income of $6.5 million.\nKellogg has come a long way since starting off with $7,500 which is what he initially deposited when he started trading. His road to success wasn't a straight line. When he first attempted to trade, he was down a few hundred dollars. This led him to realize that he didn't know what he was doing.\nSo his next moves included switching off real trading and testing his skills through paper trading. Then, he signed up for an online course his parents helped pay for. The program, which was created by Timothy Sykes, a trading teacher and former penny-stock trader known for claiming to flip his bar mitzvah cash gift into over $1 million in gains, helped him develop the skills and patience he then used to craft his skill.\nBy the time the stock market began to rally hard in 2020, he was ready to ride the upwards wave. In 2022, when the market slowed, he continued to reel in profits by betting on popular stocks like Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) and AMC (AMC), the latter of which banked him $60,000, according to a screenshot of his E-Trade brokerage account. He also traded a few small-cap stocks and saw large wins on single trades like Intelligent Living Application Group Inc. (ILAG) which earned him over $91,000, according to screenshots of his Guardian account.\nThe first indicator he uses as a sentiment guide is the volume-weighted average price (VWAP), which shows the average price paid for shares through all trading adjusted for volume. He uses it on the daily chart as a guide to determine a good buy-in price for the stock he's trading. This keeps him from being a chaser, the term popularly used for those who enter a position too late or after a stock begins to rally.\nIf the goal is to buy low and sell high, you don't want to pay more than what the average buyer paid, he noted. Therefore, Kellogg won't enter a position if the price is above the VWAP line. The opposite is true if he's shorting a stock: if the price is beneath the VWAP, he generally won't short the stock.\nOftentimes, he'll use this indicator to also determine when to exit his position because that point can sometimes indicate where a stock's price will begin to drop off. The same is also true in reverse: he'll sometimes use the VWAP to determine the price point where he'll cover his position. Therefore, if he shorted a stock at $9 and the VWAP is at $7.50, he'll use that price as a point to lock in profits.\nFor example, on January 5, he took a short position on ticker AMTD at $2.50. VWAP's center line was trending at around $2.22. So Kellogg covered his position at $2.25 and made a 10% profit.\nThe next indicator is linear regression, which shows the direction price is trending and when it may change its direction. They are three lines that overlay the candles. The lower and upper lines are the ranges of price movements or volatility, while the center line indicates the average between the two. Price action above the top line signals an overbought stock, and below the bottom line, an oversold stock.\n\"So the better a stock is respecting the lines of the channel that's created, the more predictable I think the stock's going to be,\" Kellogg said. This gives him a better sense that the stock's price action will trend according to his thesis.\nThe next indicator is volume which shows the number of shares being traded at any moment in time. Kellogg mainly uses volume as a potential indicator that a stock may reverse.\n\"Seeing big volume go through, I know that potentially a lot of people are on the wrong side. So if a big volume spike goes through near the high of the day, it's possible that a lot of people are buying the stock and a lot of people are chasing,\" Kellogg said.\nFinally, he keeps his eye on the support and resistance lines, the former being where the price tends to hold and the latter where it tends to sell off. The levels change throughout the day. Kellogg tries to find the key levels by looking for a parallel increase in volume in those areas. He also pays attention to how many times and for how long a price level holds to determine how strong that point is. While it's not an exact science, general areas where the price hoovers for 30 minutes to an hour are the strongest, he said.\n\"Eventually, you'll see a bouncing ball-type price action if the stock is going to go lower,\" Kellogg said. \"So you see it bounce from $7 to $8, then bounce again from $7.30 to $7.50, and then bounce from $7.40 to $7.10, then bounce from $7.20 and eventually cracks the support below $7. And then the question is, is it going to create a resistance level at $7 and continue to head lower?\"\nAt the end of the day, price action is king, Kellogg noted. Even if you have a thesis about why a stock's price can move in a certain direction, if the price is moving differently, you need to cut losses.\n\"I don't ever just base my entire decision off an indicator. So if an indicator isn't agreeing with the trade thesis, then I simply will cut my losses,\" Kellogg said. \"So I've never ever blamed any of my losses ever on an indicator because I don't let it get to that point. If the price action is continuing down, then I will cut my losses or if the price action is continuing up, then I'll cover my short positioning.\"\nEveryone has access and can view the same data \u2014 it's really about what you do with that data, he said. Where most traders struggle is with the psychology of trading. You can have the best strategy and indicators, but if you don't have the discipline to stick to it, then you will constantly find yourself in a bad situation. Most people don't put in enough effort to master their emotions, he said.\nThis story was originally published in March 2023.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

They said the government didn\u2019t adequately consider options to meaningfully constrain the project\u2019s oil production \u2014 and therefore its resulting carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 even as it ignored the greenhouse gas releases that could be unleashed from future developments that could be facilitated by Willow.\nSome of the project\u2019s challengers also took aim at the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s determination that Willow wouldn\u2019t harm polar bears that have dens in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska; the opponents argued instead that industrial oil operations pose a multi-faceted threat to the animals.\nGleason brushed aside those assertions Thursday, saying the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s decisions \u2014 including its conclusion that Willow-related work was unlikely to injure non-denning polar bears \u2014 were \u201creasoned\u201d and within the bounds of law. Environmental groups failed to prove the agency disregarded better available scientific evidence about the impacts of greenhouse-gas emissions from the project, Gleason said.\nErec Isaacson, president of ConocoPhillips Alaska, celebrated the ruling, saying it \u201cconfirms our confidence\u201d the government review complied with all legal requirements.\n\u201cWillow underwent nearly five years of rigorous regulatory review and environmental analysis, including extensive public involvement from the communities closest to the project site,\u201d Isaacson said in a statement. \u201cWe now want to make this project a reality and help Alaskan communities realize the extensive benefits of responsible energy development.\u201d\nErik Grafe, deputy managing attorney of the Alaska office for Earthjustice, which represented the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife and other organizations, called the ruling \u201cdisappointing\u201d and said the challengers planned to appeal.\n\u201cBeyond the illegality of Willow\u2019s approval, Interior\u2019s decision to greenlight the project in the first place moved us in the opposite direction of our national climate goals in the face of the worsening climate crisis,\u201d Grafe said.\nSiqi\u00f1iq Maupin, executive director of Sovereign Inupiat for a Living Arctic, said the ruling shows \u201cthe oil and gas industry exerts incredible power over those whose health and food are most impacted and who will most experience the climate harm and disaster this project will flame.\u201d\nThe project\u2019s backers have argued the government\u2019s review was expansive. They also emphasized that crude extracted from the site inside the 23 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska would be produced under more stringent environmental protections than elsewhere in the world, helping to bolster US energy security and provide an alternative to supplies from Russia.\n--With assistance from Andrew Janes.\n(Updates with ConocoPhillips comment in 8th and 9th paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

The New York-based firm also sold its holding in Rivian Automotive Inc., while adding more than $100 million worth of shares in UK biotech Abcam Plc.\nDruckenmiller and Soros, 93, have net worths of $9.9 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nMoney managers overseeing more than $100 million in US equities have to file a 13F form within 45 days of the end of each quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on US exchanges. It offers one of the few glimpses into how hedge funds and some large family offices invest.\nSome family offices, such as that of hedge fund billionaire David Tepper, added to their AI bets by buying more Nvidia stock in the quarter.\nOther highlights from 13F filings include:\nTPG Inc. co-founder David Bonderman\u2019s Wildcat Capital exited its $7.7 million position in Uber Technologies Inc. and accumulated a roughly $19 million holding in US online delivery firm DoorDash Inc.\nHedge fund billionaire Michael Platt\u2019s BlueCrest Capital Management invested about $106 million into iShares China Large-Cap ETF, a US-based exchanged-traded fund tracking big Chinese firms.\nWIT, an investment firm that manages part of the Walton family\u2019s fortune, similarly allocated more capital to a Vanguard ETF that tracks businesses worldwide based outside the US.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\nNo One Told AI Startups That San Francisco Is Over\nTexas Battles Wall Street in Threat to State\u2019s Muni Market\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

He wants to offer AI talent, products and services to corporate customers, emulating the business model of outsourcing providers like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd., the people said, asking to not be named as the effort isn\u2019t yet public.\nThe startup\u2019s main operations will be in Bengaluru, and it\u2019s headquartered in Singapore, where it\u2019s in stealth mode for now and will launch its offerings within months, the people said. It also plans to expand to the US, one of the people said.\nCompanies the world over are looking to harness AI, encouraged by new tools such as the ChatGPT chatbot from Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI Inc.

The startup also plans to offer services in the fields of financial services and data science and analytics. It aims to roll out products and services and begin marketing in the second half of 2024.\nBansal, 40, declined to comment.\nThe billionaire moved to Singapore after selling his Bengaluru-based internet company and now shuttles between the cities.

They established Flipkart as a more localized online retailer for India, inspired by Amazon, nearly six years before the Seattle giant entered the country\u2019s retail market. Binny went on to become the chief operating officer of Flipkart, and then its chief executive officer, before selling a majority stake in the company to Walmart in 2018 for $16 billion.\nBinny gradually sold his entire stake in Flipkart to Walmart, and began investing in tech startups in recent years.

        "text": "\n(Reuters) - U.S. retailers are gearing up for Black Friday, marking the start of the shopping season that follows the Thanksgiving holiday, while business activity data should gauge the temperature elsewhere.\nBritain's budget update is in the spotlight, while the yen might get some breathing space and Argentina heads for a key election.\nHere's your week ahead in world markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, and Naomi Rovnick, Dhara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London.\n1/ BARGAIN HUNTING\nThe crucial holiday shopping season kicks off with Black Friday on Nov. 24 at a time when investors are questioning whether the consumer-driven U.S. economy can remain resilient.\nThis year's Black Friday comes as Americans grapple with soaring interest rates and inflation that, while easing, remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\nAlready, data for October showed U.S. retail sales fell, pointing to slowing demand, although the decline was less than expected.\nThere's also likely to be plenty of interest in chip company Nvidia, which releases its latest earnings report on Nov. 21. It is the last of the results in the earnings season from the Magnificent 7 megacap companies, whose massive share gains this year have led equity indexes higher.\n2/ SOFT VS HARD\nSoft or hard landing? For sure, compelling arguments can be made for both. The European Commission expects the euro zone will avoid technical recession; Britain just sidestepped the start of one.\nThe forward-looking flash November PMIs due out globally should help investors assess recession risks and how quickly rate cuts will begin.\nThe euro zone PMI is already below the 50 number, suggesting economic activity is contracting. It is the same in Britain, while the U.S. Oct manufacturing PMI contracted sharply.\nBond heavyweight PIMCO sees the probability of a U.S. recession within one year at 50%. Market pricing for rate cuts suggests traders reckon economic growth will slow fast enough for the Fed and European Central Bank to switch to easing mode. And of course soft landing hopes could vanish fast if inflation eases more quickly and unemployment rises fast.\n3/ 11 DOWNING STREET\nUK politics has been dramatic, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak having fired his interior minister, moved former leader David Cameron back into government and reshuffled other top roles.\nFinance minister Jeremy Hunt will now change gear with his Nov. 22 Autumn Statement, focusing on boosting growth ahead of an expected 2024 election.\nAnalysts predict the government, hamstrung by a stagnant economy and high debt, won't make big investment pledges.\nStill, Hunt looks set to trim taxes for voters and businesses, offering some relief to the many Conservative lawmakers alarmed at the opposition Labour Party's big opinion poll lead. He could also downgrade near-term borrowing expectations, temporarily boosting gilts.\nNatwest says the UK may issue 10% more debt in 2024-2025 than in this fiscal year - a development that would amplify long-term concerns about gilt market oversupply.\n4/ DEATH, TAXES, WEAK YEN\nThere's an air of inevitability about a weaker yen, even with the Bank of Japan increasingly hinting at an end to ultra-loose policy and greater investor certainty that the Fed is done tightening.\nAfter pulling back from the brink of 152 per dollar at the start of the week, receiving a lifeline from cooling U.S. inflation data, the yen was back to the weaker side of 151 a day later. It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for traders, who saw support from weak U.S. payrolls numbers on Nov. 3 last only as long as the weekend.\nWhile gaping Japan-U.S. rate differentials do not bode well for the yen, the shift in policy directions should at least give forward-thinking markets some pause.\nAs long as that's not the case, pressure is on the Kishida cabinet since a weak yen is unpopular politically. And that means Tokyo is never too far from the intervention trigger.\n5/ PHOTO FINISH?\nArgentines elect a new president on Sunday in a closely fought race pitching center-left Peronist economy chief Sergio Massa against libertarian outsider Javier Milei and polls suggest a likely photo finish.\nThey offer two wildly different visions for South America's No. 2 economy: Milei's potentially painful shock therapy for the embattled country that has run out of FX reserves, inflation running at over 140% and faces recession. Pragmatist Massa pledges a unity government and more gradual change to solve the crisis that has worsened on his watch.\nInvestors are bracing for rocky times, with Argentina's crucial $44 billion IMF programme on the ropes and international bonds priced at deeply distressed levels.\nAnd there's more election-induced volatility ahead in emerging markets with Egypt, Taiwan, South Africa and India just some facing key ballots in coming months.\n(Compiled by Karin Strohecker and Dhara Ranasinghe; Graphics by Prinz Magtulis, Sumanta Sen, Kripa Jayaram, Pasit Kongkunakornkul; Editing by Mark Potter)",

Novo first sued Brooksville in July, and discovered a substance called BPC-157 in samples from Wells.\nBoth cases were filed in Florida on Wednesday.\nBrooksville managing partner Terry Myers said in an email the company disputes the new allegations and plans to file another motion to dismiss. Wells did not respond to a request for comment by email on Thursday.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned BPC-157 from use in compounded drugs in September, saying it did not have enough data to know whether it was harmful to humans, but that it could cause dangerous immune system reactions.\nNovo said the compounded versions of Wegovy tested from Brooksville were also less potent than advertised, with one sample shown to be at least 19% weaker than indicated.\n\u201cCompounded products do not have the same safety, quality and effectiveness assurances as FDA-approved drugs, and adulterated and misbranded injectable compounded drugs may expose patients to significant health risks,\u201d Jason Brett, a Novo Nordisk executive, said in a statement.\nNovo said the lawsuits aim to stop the two pharmacies from selling products claiming to contain semaglutide - the main ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic - and prevent Wells Pharmacy from claiming its products are FDA approved or that BPC-157 has health benefits without making customers aware of its safety risks.\nBrooksville's Myers said the company buys its bulk ingredients, including semaglutide, from FDA-registered facilities.\nIt has tested its formulation with a third-party lab and found it remains potent for 180 days when stored in a refrigerator, 90 days when stored at room temperature and 45 days when stored at 40 degrees Celsius.\nNovo has already filed 12 lawsuits against medical spas, weight-loss clinics and compounding pharmacies offering products that claim to contain semaglutide.\nThe company said it had obtained temporary orders against six of those to stop them claiming their products are authentic, FDA approved or associated with Novo Nordisk.\nNovo's biggest rival in the obesity drug market, Eli Lilly , has also sued several medical spas, weight-loss clinics and compounding pharmacies this year to stop them from selling products purporting to contain tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its diabetes drug Mounjaro and recently-approved weight loss medicine Zepbound.\nThe case against Wells was filed in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, Ocala division and the suit against Brooksville in U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, Tampa division.

        "text": "\nWhatever Americans are grateful for, the Joe Biden economy isn\u2019t on the list.\nThe 2024 holiday season is set to highlight the cognitive dissonance of American consumers who think everything is terrible but keep spending money anyway. The University of Michigan Sentiment Index has dropped for four months in a row and is at deeply recessionary levels. Yet early holiday spending is up 5% over last year\u2019s levels and retailers expect that to hold up through the end of the year for a solid end to 2024.\nInflation is the national depressant. The rate of inflation has slowed sharply, from a peak of 8.9% in 2022 to just 3.2% now. But the combined price hikes of the last two years mean that some things remain uncomfortably expensive. Perhaps more importantly, prices are just higher than people think they should be.\nBiden and his economic advisers often point to things coming down in price as evidence that inflation is on the run and everything ought to be fine. The problem, however, is that many prices are down from peak levels but still a lot higher than they used to be. Normal people get to choose what to use as their basis for comparison, and for many people, the right price of something is the cheapest they remember it being.\nA Thanksgiving dinner will cost 4.5% less this year than last, for instance. But it\u2019s still 14.7% costlier than in 2021 and 25% more expensive than in 2019, the last year before the COVID pandemic. So, bad.\nGasoline costs 11% less than it did a year ago and 3% less than it did two years ago. But don\u2019t get too optimistic, because pump prices are still 27% higher than they were in 2019.\nIf you\u2019re planning to fly for holiday travel, the typical flight will cost 13% less than last year. But airfares are still 24% higher than they were in 2021. Airfares are lower than they were in 2019, but memories fail when the news is good.\nIf you\u2019re that rare person who gives your spouse a car for Christmas, it\u2019ll cost 2% more than one year ago, 10% more than two years ago, and 23% more than four years ago.\nAnd while splurging on gifts, you still need to pay rent, which may be the biggest bummer of all: up 7% in a year, 15% in two years, and 22% in four years.\nThere\u2019s almost always some inflation. What we\u2019ve learned from the Biden-era bout of inflation is that price hikes only become a problem when people notice them. The Federal Reserve likes to keep inflation around 2%, which is more or less the average from 2000 through 2020. At 2% inflation, the cost of a gallon of milk would rise from $4.36 to $4.44 in a year. Price hawks might notice, but most people wouldn\u2019t. And incomes normally grow by a little bit more than inflation, so that extra $0.08 would be offset by $0.10 or $0.12 in additional income.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nDuring the last two years, everybody on a budget has noticed the higher cost of cereal, electricity, eating out, and even pet food. That\u2019s why Biden\u2019s approval rating is stuck at a weak 40%, with voters rating him even worse on his handling of the economy. Americans are so unnerved by inflation that they expect it to keep getting worse even though it has been consistently getting better. Economists forecast even lower inflation in 2024, but people don\u2019t believe them.\nBiden needs two things to improve his standing with voters, along with his 2024 reelection odds. One is outright price declines in some products and services that are important to shoppers. The second is consumer awareness that prices are actually falling.\nThe holiday shopping season could brighten spirits. A few things are already cheaper than they were in 2022, 2021, and even 2019, including toys and electronics. Walmart\u2019s CEO and other retail executives say they\u2019re prepared to offer excessive discounting to keep shoppers streaming in. Some stock analysts worry that firms are losing their \u201cpricing power,\u201d another way of saying supply is finally outstripping demand after three years of COVID-related distortions.\nEntering 2024, Biden needs food and rent inflation to flatline and, ideally, go into reverse, with staples of some prices falling back toward levels from 2021, when Biden took office. Any chance of that? Call it a coin toss. What seems clearer is that nobody is thankful for a falling rate of price increases. It will take falling prices before anybody celebrates.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\nBy Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) - - Kyle Vogt, the CEO of General Motors' robot-taxi unit Cruise, has resigned from the company a day after apologizing to staff as the company undergoes a safety review of its U.S. fleet.\nVogt, 38, offered little in the way of explanation, stating simply \"I have resigned from my position\" in an email to staff viewed by Reuters on Sunday. Vogt founded Cruise in 2013.\nHis decision follows weeks of turmoil at the unit, which had to pull all its vehicles from testing in the United States to conduct a safety review after an Oct. 2 accident that ended with one of Cruise's self-driving taxis dragging a pedestrian.\nA source familiar with the circumstances of Vogt's resignation said Vogt had informed the board of his decision to leave on Sunday after apologizing to staff for the company's problems in an email on Saturday.\n\"As CEO, I take responsibility for the situation Cruise is in today. There are no excuses, and there is no sugar coating what has happened. We need to double down on safety, transparency, and community engagement,\" he wrote in the email, reported exclusively by Reuters.\nCruise's woes are also a setback for an industry dependent on public trust and the cooperation of regulators. The unit had in recent months touted ambitious plans to expand to more cities, offering fully autonomous taxi rides.\nVogt's resignation came after GM and the board at Cruise increased their scrutiny of its leadership.\nThe Cruise board met on Nov. 13 and the next day named GM general counsel Craig Glidden as Cruise's chief administrative officer. The board also said it would retain a third-party safety expert to assess safety operations and culture.\nGM CEO Mary Barra said in an email to employees seen by Reuters that Glidden will serve as Cruise's co-president with Mo Elshenawy, who will also become chief technology officer.\n\"We continue to believe strongly in Cruise's mission and the potential of its transformative technology as we look to make transportation safer, cleaner and more accessible,\" she said.\nFormer Tesla President Jon McNeill, a GM director since 2022, was named vice chairman of the Cruise board alongside Barra, who is the chair.\nCruise competes with Alphabet\u2019s Waymo in deploying autonomous vehicles and had been testing hundreds in several cities across the U.S., notably its home of San Francisco.\nIn October, the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Cruise to remove its driverless cars from state roads, calling them a risk to the public and saying the company had misrepresented the safety of its technology.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in October opened an investigation into pedestrian risks at Cruise and the Cruise board hired law firm Quinn Emanuel to review Cruise management's responses to regulators investigating the Oct. 2 accident.\n\"The last 10 years have been amazing, and I'm grateful to everyone who helped Cruise along the way,\" Vogt wrote in his email. In a post on social media platform X shortly after his resignation, he added: \"Cruise is still just getting started, and I believe it has a great future ahead.\"\nBarra has told investors Cruise could generate $50 billion in revenue by 2030. The operation lost more than $700 million in the third quarter of this year on its plans to expand operations to 15 U.S. cities.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; additional reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Kenneth Li and Miral Fahmy)",

At the same time, Microsoft remains a frequent target of critics, who complain that its software is prone to flaws, making it a frequent target for criminal and nation-state hackers.\nThose problems resurfaced earlier this year, when hackers used a stolen consumer signing key to forge authentication tokens, which are meant to verify a user\u2019s identity. They then accessed user email from about 25 organizations, including US government agencies. Among the victims was US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and State Department officials, whose emails were accessed just ahead of a meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Microsoft tied the hackers to China.\nRead More: Commerce Chief Raimondo\u2019s Email Hacked in Breach Tied to China\nUS Senator Ron Wyden wrote a blistering letter on July 27 about the lapse, calling for an investigation, and shortly thereafter, a government-led cybersecurity advisory panel opened a probe into the risks of cloud computing, which includes a look into Microsoft\u2019s role in the email hack.\n\u201cGovernment emails were stolen because Microsoft committed another error,\u201d Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said in his letter. \u201cMicrosoft should not have had a single skeleton key that, when inevitably stolen, could be used to forge access to different customers\u2019 private communications.\u201d\nAmit Yoran, the chief executive officer of the cybersecurity company Tenable Holdings Inc., also criticized Microsoft, saying on LinkedIn in August that the company\u2019s \u201clack of transparency applies to breaches, irresponsible security practices and to vulnerabilities, all of which expose their customers to risks they are deliberately kept in the dark about.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s announcement, called the Secure Future Initiative, comes after the federal government has indicated that it expects software makers to take more responsibility for securing their products. In February, for instance, Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said bad software and unsafe practices are facilitating ransomware attacks, and she said the adoption of some of Microsoft\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s security protocols such as two-factor authentication was disappointing.\nRead More: US Cyber Leader Urges Microsoft, Twitter to Up User Security\nAnd, on Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Texas-based SolarWinds Corp., alleging the company defrauded investors by downplaying security risks ahead of a hack of its software. In that cyberattack, which became public in December 2020, Russian state-sponsored hackers inserted malware into an update for a popular SolarWinds software product, creating a digital backdoor when customers downloaded it.\nThe hackers used that backdoor to further infiltrate about 100 organizations, including US government agencies, according to the SEC. The lesson of the SEC suit was that security professionals shouldn\u2019t sugarcoat problems that they are seeing and be more transparent about them, Michael Coates, chief information security officer at CoinList and a former security head at Twitter, told Bloomberg News.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Smith said the company is committed to building an AI-based cyber shield to protect customers and countries around the world.\n\u201cOne reason these AI advances are so important is because of their ability to address one of the world\u2019s most pressing cybersecurity challenges,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUbiquitous devices and constant internet connections have created a vast sea of digital data.\u201d\n\u201cBut AI is a game changer,\u201d he said.\nIn addition, Microsoft said it will use AI-powered analysis and other measures to audit and secure code against advanced threats, and it vowed to strengthen identity protection at a time when password attacks have increased and hackers have developed more sophisticated methods to steal and use login credentials. As part of the latter initiative, Microsoft said it would migrate to a \u201cnew and fully automated consumer and enterprise key management system with an architecture designed to ensure that keys remain inaccessible even when underlying processes may be corrupted.\u201d\nIn her criticism of Microsoft earlier this year, Easterly said that Microsoft needs to \u201crecapture the ethos\u201d of what company co-founder Bill Gates called \u201ctrustworthy computing\u201d in 2002. At that time, Microsoft was reeling from computer worms, and Gates wrote a memo ordering software developers to prioritize security. \u201cWe can and must do better,\u201d he wrote.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nMarvel\u2019s Latest Movie Will Show If Superheroes Ever Get Tired\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 One year ago, billionaire and new owner Elon Musk walked into Twitter's San Francisco headquarters with a white bathroom sink and a grin, fired its CEO and other top executives and began transforming the social media platform into what is now known as X.\nX looks and feels something like Twitter, but the more time you spend on it the clearer it becomes that it's merely an approximation. Musk has dismantled core features of what made Twitter, Twitter \u2014 its name and blue bird logo, its verification system, its Trust and Safety advisory group. Not to mention content moderation and hate speech enforcement.\nHe also fired, laid off or lost the majority of its workforce \u2014 engineers who keep the site running, moderators who keep it from being overrun with hate, executives in charge of making rules and enforcing them.\nThe result, long-term Twitter watchers say, has been the end of the platform's role as an imperfect but useful place to find out what's going on in the world. What X will become, and whether Musk can achieve his ambition of turning it into an \u201ceverything app\u201d that everyone uses, remains as unclear as it was a year ago.\n\u201cMusk hasn\u2019t managed to make a single meaningful improvement to the platform and is no closer to his vision of an \u2018everything app,\u2019 than he was a year ago,\" said Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cInstead, X has driven away users, advertisers, and now it has lost its primary value proposition in the social media world: Being a central hub for news.\u201d\nAs one of the platform's most popular and prolific users even before he bought the company, Musk had a unique experience on Twitter that is markedly different from how regular users experience it. But many of the changes he's introduced to X has been based on his own impressions of the site \u2014 in fact, he even polled his millions of followers for advice on how to run it (they said he should step down).\n\u201cMusk\u2019s treatment of the platform as a technology company that he could remake in his vision rather than a social network fueled by people and ad dollars has been the single largest cause of the demise of Twitter,\u201d Enberg said.\nThe blue checkmarks that once signified that the person or institution behind an account was who they said they are \u2014 a celebrity, athlete, journalist from global or local publication, a nonprofit agency \u2014 now merely shows that someone pays $8 a month for a subscription service that boosts their posts above un-checked users. It\u2019s these paying accounts that have been found to spread misinformation on the platform that is often amplified by its algorithms.\nOn Thursday, for instance, a new report from the left-leaning nonprofit Media Matters found that numerous blue-checked X accounts with tens of thousands of followers claimed that the mass shooting in Maine was a \u201cfalse flag,\u201d planned by the government. Researchers also found such accounts spreading misinformation and propaganda about the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 so much so that the European Commission made a formal, legally binding request for information to X over its handling of hate speech, misinformation and violent terrorist content related to the war.\nIan Bremmer, a prominent foreign policy expert, posted on X this month that the level of disinformation on the Israel-Hamas war \u201cbeing algorithmically promoted\u201d on the platform \u201cis unlike anything I\u2019ve ever been exposed to in my career as a political scientist.\u201d\nIt's not just the platform's identity that's on shaky grounds. Twitter was already struggling financially when Musk purchased it for $44 billion in a deal that closed Oct. 27, 2022, and the situation appears more precarious today. Musk took the company private, so its books are no longer public \u2014 but in July, the Tesla CEO said the company had lost about half of its advertising revenue and continues to face a large debt load.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still negative cash flow,\" he posted on the site on July 14, due to about a \"50% drop in advertising revenue plus heavy debt load.\"\n\u201cNeed to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else,\u201d he said.\nIn May, Musk hired Linda Yaccarino, a former NBC executive with deep ties to the advertising industry in an attempt to lure back top brands, but the effort has been slow to pay off. While some advertisers have returned to X, they are not spending as much as they did in the past \u2014 despite a rebound in the online advertising market that boosted the most recent quarterly profits for Facebook parent company, Meta, and Google parent company, Alphabet.\nInsider Intelligence estimates that X will bring in $1.89 billion in advertising revenue this year, down 54% from 2022. The last time its ad revenue was near this level was in 2015, when it came in at $1.99 billion. In 2022, it was $4.12 billion according to the research firm's estimates.\nOutside research also shows that people are using X less.\nAccording to research firm Similarweb, global web traffic to Twitter.com was down 14%, year-over-year, and traffic to the ads.twitter.com portal for advertisers was down 16.5%. Performance on mobile was no better, down 17.8% year-over-year based on combined monthly active users for Apple's iOS and Android.\n\u201cEven though the cultural relevance of Twitter was already starting to decline,\" before Musk took it over, \"it\u2019s as if the platform no longer exists. And it\u2019s been a death by a thousand cuts,\u201d Enberg said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really fascinating is that almost all of the wounds have been self-inflicted. Usually when a social platform, starts to lose its relevance there are at least some external factors at play, but that\u2019s not the case here.\u201d",

Among the uncertainties is aid for Ukraine.\nThe government had planned to double military aid to Ukraine to 8 billion euros next year but a defence ministry spokesperson would not be drawn on whether the pledge would be kept, referring to ongoing to discussions.\n\"The political fallout from Germany\u2019s constitutional court ruling continues to rock German politics and is now impacting EU politics as well, making a deal over a revised EU budget a lot less likely at the 14-15 December European Council, and even threatening the bloc\u2019s \u20ac50bn commitment to fund Ukraine through 2027,\" said a note by the Eurasia Group.\nINDUSTRY URGES CLARITY\nGreens Economy Minister Robert Habeck has warned that Germany's place as an investment hub is at stake, as well as jobs, and industry chiefs have called for clarity quickly.\n\"German industry is looking at the current political situation with the greatest concern,\" said Siegfried Russwurm, president of the BDI industry association.\nUnderscoring the jitters, a minister in the state of Saxony-Anhalt warned the billions in subsidies for U.S. chipmaker were at risk.\nSuch a move, and a similar threat to investments by Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC, would undercut Germany's plans to base critical industry on home soil as part of a policy overhaul after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nSo far, Berlin has stuck by an agreement for 10 billion euros in subsidies with Intel, which will develop two chipmaking plants.\n\"I firmly assume that the commitments for Intel and TSMC will remain,\" a government source said, adding: \"This is very important to the chancellor, as well as to the economy minister.\"\nThe influential VDA autos association, which represents giants like BMW and Volkswagen as well as smaller suppliers, urged the government to provide a clear, reliable basis for planning as quickly as possible.\nThe government must be \"more committed and determined than before in pushing ahead with energy partnerships and trade and raw materials agreements to strengthen Germany as an industrial location,\" a spokesperson for the VDA said.\nIndustrial firm Thyssenkrupp acknowledged that the budget ructions may have repercussions on Germany's hydrogen sector, a nascent industry Scholz has pinned a lot of hopes on.\n\"We need to get ... into conversations with possible suppliers of hydrogen and then get answers from them. This will happen in the course of next early 2024 and we will see how far hydrogen is available,\" CEO Miguel Lopez said.

DBS also has no direct exposure to the conflict in the Middle East, he added.\nThe bank's July-September net profit rose to S$2.63 billion ($1.94 billion) from S$2.24 billion a year earlier as total income grew to a record on higher interest margins and fee income.\nThat beat the mean estimate of S$2.5 billion from four analysts surveyed by LSEG.\nNevertheless, specific allowances of S$197 million were higher than recent quarters as the bank set aside contingencies for exposure linked to a suspected money laundering case in Singapore, one of the country's largest ever. The scandal has led to banks sharpening their scrutiny.\nGupta also expected the bank's 2024 net interest income to be around this year's level, and fee income momentum to be sustained by wealth management and cards.\nHe also forecast next year's profit before allowances to be higher, and total allowances to normalise to 17-20 basis points of loans, according to the statement.\n\"DBS seems to provide some reassurances that it sees the higher-for-longer interest rates as a net benefit to its earnings into 2024,\" said Yeap Jun Rong, IG Asia's market analyst. \"This provides some much-needed comfort, at a time where loan demand continues to soften.\"\nBesides higher global interest rates, Singapore banks have benefited from strong inflows of wealth drawn in by the city-state's political stability.\nBut global economic uncertainty could weigh on Singapore's economic prospects.

Part of the Fed\u2019s goal is too cool the economy and labor market, which officials say should slow price growth.\nIn September, consumer prices were up 3.7% from a year earlier, down from a peak 9.1% in June last year. However, U.S. economic growth surged in the July-September quarter on the back of robust consumer spending.\nThe Labor Department reported last week that employers posted 9.6 million job openings in September, up from 9.5 million in August. Layoffs fell to 1.5 million from 1.7 million.\nU.S. private employers slowed their hiring in October, adding a modest but still decent 150,000 jobs.\nLast month\u2019s job growth, though down sharply from a robust 297,000 gain in September, was solid enough to suggest that many companies still want to hire and that the economy remains sturdy.",

        "date": "2023-10-31T12:49:14.000Z",
        "text": "\nBy Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor costs increased solidly in the third quarter amid strong wage growth while house price inflation accelerated in August, the latest signs that the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates high for some time.\nThe reports on Tuesday pose a threat to efforts by the U.S. central bank to bring inflation to its 2% target. Fed officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged but maintain its hawkish bias at the conclusion of that meeting as a recent spike in U.S. Treasury yields and stock market sell-off have tightened financial conditions.\n\"Those wage increases are likely to keep inflation running above target while higher house prices could lead to a pick-up in shelter inflation,\" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup in New York. \"For now the Fed will remain on-hold, but the evident upside risk to inflation means Chair (Jerome) Powell and committee will keep potential further rate hikes on the table.\"\nThe Employment Cost Index (ECI), the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 1.1% last quarter after increasing 1.0% in the April-June period, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI would rise 1.0%.\nLabor costs increased 4.3% on a year-on-year basis, the smallest gain since the fourth quarter of 2021, after advancing by 4.5% in the second quarter. Growth in annual compensation is gradually slowing after peaking at 5.1% last year, in line with some easing in labor market conditions. It, however, remains well above the pre-pandemic pace.\nThe rise in compensation helps to explain the surge in consumer spending last quarter, which contributed to the fastest economic growth rate in nearly two years.\nThe ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation because it adjusts for composition and job-quality changes. Since March 2022, the Fed has raised its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range.\nWages increased 1.2% in the third quarter after climbing 1.0% in the prior three months. They were up 4.6% on a year-on-year basis after advancing by the same margin in the second quarter. Strong wage growth is being driven by worker shortages that still persist in some services industries.\nSeptember's job openings data on Wednesday will shed light on the state of demand for labor.\nThough consumers continue to worry about the economy's outlook, more are planning vacations over the next six months and are not contemplating scaling back in a major way on purchases of motor vehicles and other big-ticket items, according to a survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday.\nTheir concerns about the economy center around the violence in the Middle East as well as domestic politics, likely reflecting the protracted battle to elect a speaker in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nThe Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, rose to 26.3 from 25.5 in September. This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. Overall, the consumer confidence index dropped moderately to 102.6 this month from 104.3 in September.\n\"The U.S. consumer is in okay financial shape,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas. \"For well-off Americans, inflation is a source of frustration but not enough to force cutbacks in overall spending.\"\nStocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.\nCONSUMER CONFIDENCE EBBS\nThe compensation report showed private-sector wages gained 1.1% after rising 1.0% in the April-June quarter. They advanced 4.5% on a year-on-year basis. There were notable increase in wages in the financial activities and education and health services sectors. But wage growth slowed in the leisure and hospitality industry, which had experienced worker shortages.\nManufacturing also reported a moderation in wage gains.\nState and local government wages shot up 1.8% after increasing 0.8% in the prior quarter. They were driven by rises in education and health services as well as public administration. State and local government wages increased 4.8% on a year-on-year basis, the most since the government started tracking the series in 2001.\nInflation-adjusted wages for all workers rose 0.9% on a year-on-year basis after jumping 1.7% in the second quarter. While slowing, wages should continue to underpin spending.\nBenefits rose 0.9% last quarter after climbing by the same margin in the April-June period. They increased 4.1% on a year-on-year basis.\nEconomists expected the higher wages and benefits to pressure corporate profits, with Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic noting that \"some companies are losing a bit of their pricing power.\"\nA third report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showed house prices increased 0.6% in August, driven by an acute shortage of previously owned homes. House prices rose 0.8% in July. While lofty house prices are boosting household wealth, they could keep inflation elevated in the near-term.\nIn the 12 months through August, house prices accelerated 5.6% after advancing 4.6% in July. With the rate on the popular fixed 30-year mortgage near 8%, some economists see limited scope for house prices to keep rising, which would result in rents contributing less to inflation.\nHigher rents were the major drivers of inflation in September after cooling somewhat in prior months.\nEven as house prices continue to march higher, there are signs that shelter inflation could moderate next year.\nA fourth report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showed the rental vacancy rate jumped 6.6% in the third quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2021, from 6.3% in the April-June period.\n\"We still think it is likely that the surge in mortgage rates will slow the rise in prices in the secondary market going forward,\" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP in New York.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Deepa Babington)",

While the fines are relatively small, they are among the biggest the watchdog has ever issued and indicate that the inspection deal, a decade in the making, is working as hoped.\n\"\nThe days of China-based firms evading accountability are over. The PCAOB is demonstrating that we will take action to protect investors in U.S. markets and impose tough sanctions against anyone who violates PCAOB rules and standards, no matter where they are located,\" said PCAOB chair Erica Williams in a statement.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers firms in Hong Kong and China agreed to pay a total of $7 million for violating quality control standards after they failed to detect or prevent extensive answer-sharing on mandatory training courses, the PCAOB said.\n\"After becoming aware of these issues, the firms investigated these matters promptly and took remedial action,\" the PwC affiliates said in a joint statement, noting they reported the problems to the PCAOB.\nThe PCAOB also fined Shandong Haoxin Certified Public Accountants Co., Ltd. and four accountants $940,000 for violations including issuing a false audit report and failing to maintain independence from a public company client. The individuals are also facing industry bars of varying lengths, the PCAOB said.\nHaoxin did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\nThe U.S. has for years worried that the auditors of U.S.-listed Chinese companies were falling down on the job, putting investors at risk. But Beijing had resisted allowing the PCAOB access to its auditors' records, citing state secrecy concerns.\nIn August 2022, the two countries - spurred on by a new U.S. law that threatened to kick potentially 200 Chinese companies off U.S. exchanges - finally agreed a framework for beginning inspections of eight audits.\nIn May, the PCAOB said it found a slew of deficiencies in audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies performed by PwC in Hong Kong and KPMG. At the time, the watchdog said it was common to find issues when first accessing a country's auditors.\nIt did not disclose which companies' audits it had selected for inspection, but Reuters\nhas previously reported that Alibaba Group Holding and Yum China Holdings were among them.\nThe PCAOB's inspection in the region continue and the regulator continues to have \"complete access\" in its inspections, Williams said on Thursday.\n\"American investors are better protected when the PCAOB can audit the auditors of issuers listed in the United States,\" U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.

The man in Rijeka had reportedly consumed Romerquelle Emotion Blueberry Pomegranate from a glass bottle, while the student in Zagreb was said to have drunk Coca-Cola from a plastic bottle he took from a machine at his faculty. Another similar case had been previously reported in May.\nA hospital in Rijeka on Tuesday said the man was treated for chemical injuries to the esophagus.\n\u201cThose are probably some corrosive materials and we need to see if there are any added elements in the drink,\" said Krunoslav Capak, the head of Croatia's Public Health Institute.",

The dollar was last up 1.7% at 151.56 yen, on track for its best one-day increase since late April.\nThe euro jumped against the Japanese currency to a 15-year high of 160.84 yen, and was last up 1.3% at 160.20 yen . It was on pace for its biggest daily gain since late July.\n\"Currency traders unquestionably have their knives out for the yen after last night's dangerously-ambiguous policy change from the Bank of Japan,\" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto.\n\"With major unknowns remaining around the central bank\u2019s reaction function, and another raft of stronger-than-expected data helping boost US yields, rate differentials are tilting more aggressively against the yen as the session unfolds.\u201d\nWhile shares in Europe gained as investors drew comfort from resilient regional results, Asian equities earlier lost ground on renewed fears over the prospects for the Chinese economy following weak manufacturing data.\nOn Wall Street, heavy-machinery maker Caterpillar fell as dealer inventories rose and a large order backlog shrank, indicating demand is slowing. Pfizer's shares were flat after the drugmaker reported its first quarterly loss since 2019.\nInvestors are waiting to see what the Fed says after a two-day policy meeting ends on Wednesday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 135.04 points, or 0.41%, to 33,064, the S&P 500 gained 27.83 points, or 0.67%, to 4,194.65 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.13 points, or 0.51%, to 12,854.61.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.59% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.33%.\nLonger-dated Treasury yields dipped as investors awaited the Fed statement and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last week hit 16-year highs as investors contemplate higher yields for longer, and on concerns about increasing U.S. Treasury supply.\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose 0.3 basis points to 4.880%.\nEuro zone yields fell as individual country inflation data pointed to a lower print for the currency bloc overall later in the day. Germany's benchmark 10-year yield fell 5.5 basis points to 2.77%, testing the previous day's two-week low.\nOil prices eased as investors worried less about potential supply disruptions from the Middle East. Also, data showed rising output from OPEC and the United States.\nBrent crude futures for December delivery, settled 4 cents lower at $87.41 a barrel, ahead of their expiry later on Tuesday. The more heavily traded January contract fell $1.33, or 1.4%\uff0cto $85.02. U.S. crude for December delivery fell $1.29, or 1.6%, to $81.02, while those for January delivery fell $1.18 to $80.50.\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch and Herbert Lash in New York; additional reporting by Tom Wilson in London and Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Nick Zieminski)",

        "text": "\nMANCHESTER, England, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Manchester City offered a gleeful reminder of the gulf in class between themselves and Manchester United with a dismissive 3-0 win at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday.\nThe weekend's big clash turned out to be painfully one-sided as Erling Haaland struck twice to move into double figures for Premier League goals this season while Phil Foden was also on target for Pep Guardiola's side.\nLiverpool consolidated their place in the top four with a 3-0 home victory against Nottingham Forest while fifth-placed Aston Villa racked up a 12th successive home league win as they cruised to a 3-1 defeat of struggling Luton Town.\nEverton enjoyed a poignant 1-0 victory at West Ham United, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin scoring the only goal at the London Stadium, at the end of a week in which chairman Bill Kenwright died at the age of 78. The win moved Everton up to 15th.\nIn the day's other match, Brighton & Hove Albion drew 1-1 at home to Fulham as their winless run extended to four games.\nCity's victory lifted the champions to 24 points, the same as Arsenal who thrashed Sheffield United 5-0 on Saturday and two points behind surprise leaders Tottenham Hotspur who beat Crystal Palace on Friday.\nUnited are eighth -- nine points behind City and on the evidence of Sunday that gap will only get bigger.\n\"It's different levels. The United players are just short in every aspect. Technically and tactically. It's a long way back for this team,\" former United captain Roy Keane told Sky Sports.\nErik Ten Hag's side had appeared to have turned a corner with narrow league wins over Brentford and Sheffield United and a Champions League victory against FC Copenhagen.\nBut those wins papered over the cracks and City exposed them with ruthless efficiency in a dominant display that left United sucking up a fifth defeat in their opening 10 Premier League games of the season -- the most since 1986-87.\nHAALAND'S FIRST GOALS AT OLD TRAFFORD\nThe match began with moving tributes to Manchester United great Bobby Charlton who died last weekend but any sense that the hosts could produce a display the iconic Charlton would have been proud of soon vanished.\nHaaland scored with a 26th-minute penalty -- his first goal at Old Trafford -- after United striker Rasmus Hojlund was penalised for dragging down Rodri.\nThe Norwegian then rammed home a header from Bernardo Silva's cross to make it 2-0 shortly after the break, his 11th league goal of the season, and he turned provider to set up Foden to complete United's misery as the rain tumbled down.\n\"It is definitely one of the best wins. To win 3-0 away with this crowd, I think it is definitely one of the best performances,\" Haaland said.\nGoals by Diogo Jota, Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah eased Liverpool to victory over Forest although the win was overshadowed by events off the field.\nAfter scoring the opener, Jota held up the shirt of team mate Luis Diaz, who missed the game following the kidnapping of his parents in his native Colombia.\n\"Luis was with us in the hotel, then he went home. It's a very hard situation and I don't know how anyone would react if it happened to you,\" Jota told the BBC.\nWhile the victory was welcome, manager Juergen Klopp also said his thoughts had been with Diaz.\n\"Preparation was the most difficult I had in my life. Didn't expect it, couldn't prepare for it, We try to help Lucho (Diaz) as much as we can,\" he said.\nAston Villa are turning their stadium into a fortress and Luton were the latest team to succumb there.\nJohn McGinn gave Unai Emery's side the lead in the 17th minute and Moussa Diaby rifled in a shot four minutes into the second half before a Tom Lockyer own goal just past the hour mark put Villa in cruise control.\nThe only blot on Villa's copybook was a bizarre own goal when a defensive header hit the crossbar and rebounded into the net off keeper Emiliano Martinez.

We are continuing to work closely with relevant government agencies and are focusing on ensuring a sustainable supply,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. company told Reuters in a statement.\nTirzepatide is the name of the active ingredient in Mounjaro. A launch is expected to touch off fierce competition with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy injection drug in a booming weight-loss market.\nThe Lilly spokesperson added that the injection device in question would be different from the pen that Lilly plans to use for the weight-loss drug in the United States, where it was rebranded as Zepbound. Within the United Kingdom, Lilly will use one pen type for both uses against type 2 diabetes and obesity.\nBritain's drug regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said it could not comment on any device applications, citing commercial confidentiality.\nNearly one in three adults are obese in Britain, the highest in Europe, according to a 2019 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report.\nOverweight-related illnesses account for 8.4% of health expenditure and when combined with lower labour market output, it reduces UK GDP by 3.4%, it said. Obesity is usually defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above.\nThe Lilly drug already has approval for type 2 diabetes but has yet to be launched by the manufacturer in this indication in the UK.\nAsked when it would be available for weight loss in Britain, Lilly would not give a date.\n\"Before launching a new treatment Lilly needs to ensure that it can appropriately supply the medicine, considering many factors including expected demand and competitive supply,\" it said in a statement.\nNEW DRUG COULD HELP THOUSANDS\nBritain's health secretary welcomed the prospect of a new weight-loss treatment, saying it could help thousands of people.\n\"Tackling obesity could help cut waiting lists and save the NHS (National Health Service) billions of pounds,\" Steve Barclay said in a statement.\nHe said further approvals were needed before the drug can be covered by the NHS.\nDavid Strain, associate professor of cardiometabolic health at the University of Exeter, who sees type 2 diabetes patients in the state-run health system, urged steps against the promotion of unhealthy food as patients wait for the new drug.\n\u201cIt is great that tirzepatide has been approved, but we are not going to have that in our hands soon, and the government is currently trying to distract from the fact that we are not yet implementing upstream measures to prevent obesity in the first place,\u201d said Strain.\nA spokesperson for NHS England said the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, is assessing the treatment.\nA spokesperson for the cost-effectiveness body said that NICE planned to publish final guidance on its appraisal on tirzepatide for weight management and diabetes in March 2024.\nTirzepatide has been available under the Mounjaro brand name for type 2 diabetes since 2022 in the United States. It is not yet available in Britain.\nNICE in October published guidance on Mounjaro for treating type 2 diabetes, saying it would be given to patients with poorly controlled diabetes who suffer from certain levels of obesity or medical conditions.\nFrom the moment of publication, NHS has three months to make tirzepatide available to be prescribed.\n(Reporting by Maggie Fick in London and Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt Editing by David Goodman, Tomasz Janowski and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

Moody\u2019s has scheduled a potential update on the country for Friday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a rosy picture for Italy right now, but it\u2019s still not a situation in which you would think they could go to non-investment grade,\u201d Kraemer, who is now chief economist at LBBW in the southwest German city of Stuttgart, said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t really think Moody\u2019s will do it, because there\u2019s really no reason.\u201d\nAn announcement would be the first since Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni unveiled a budget in September featuring a looser fiscal stance. That caused the spread between Italian and German bond yields, a key measure of risk, to widen to 210 basis points for the first time since January.\nDespite that shift in profile for the public finances, both Fitch Ratings and S&P maintained stable views on the country a level higher than the Moody\u2019s assessment of Baa3 \u2014 just one step above junk, with a negative outlook. Any lower would mean describing Italy as a \u201csubstantial credit risk.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot explain how they ended up in this situation,\u201d said Kraemer. \u201cThey\u2019ve dug themselves into a hole.\u201d\nThat perspective is founded on his experience as a key behind-the-scenes protagonist of Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis earlier this century.\nPivotal calls Kraemer oversaw as S&P\u2019s chief sovereign analyst in the region for more than a decade included Italy\u2019s first downgrade since it joined the euro, in 2004. Six years later, he and his colleagues cut Greece to junk, intensifying the turmoil engulfing the country and shaking markets globally.\n\u201cWe all know from experience that if you go below the investment-grade divide, things will happen,\u201d Kraemer said. \u201cWe saw it with Greece, so there needs to be thought before action. But Greece is one thing, Italy is quite another \u2014 just looking at the size of their debt and economy.\u201d\nCompared with its two major rivals, Moody\u2019s has the widest spectrum of assessments of members of the Group of Seven.\nThe US\u2019s last remaining top credit rating is from the company, which put the country on a negative outlook last week. The Aaa assessment is now under threat because of wider budget deficits and political polarization.\nKraemer, who was at S&P in 2011 when it was first to strip the US of its top rating, observed that the comparison with Italy is significant.\n\u201cMoody\u2019s stance is all the more surprising because they have been very lenient on other developed markets \u2014 particularly if we look at the US,\u201d he said.\nEven though a downgrade isn\u2019t likely this week, Kraemer sees one reason why a cut to junk could make strategic sense.\n\u201cIf you do really believe Italy is on the way to non-investment grade level, then as a rating agency, you would want to be the first mover,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problems and the pressures start from the second rating agency.\u201d\nItaly Close to Junk\nMoody\u2019s placed its Baa3 rating on negative outlook in August 2022, citing accumulating risks:\n(1) \u201cHeightened risks that the political environment will impede the implementation of structural reforms, including those contained in Italy\u2019s National Recovery and Resilience Plan.\u201d\n(2) \u201cIncreased risk that energy supply challenges will weaken economic prospects.\u201d\n(3) \u201cRisks that Italy\u2019s fiscal strength will be further weakened by sluggish growth, higher funding costs, and potentially weaker fiscal discipline.\u201d\nAsked for a comment on the remarks, a spokesperson for Moody\u2019s said that the company\u2019s published research sets out the rationale behind its approach.\nInvestors share Kraemer\u2019s view that a downgrade is unlikely this week. The spread between 10-year Italian and German yields has stayed below 190 basis points in recent days and was at 183 points in early trading on Tuesday.\nKraemer acknowledges that Italy has no room for complacency, and Meloni\u2019s government shouldn\u2019t keep testing markets.\nHe sees the UK experience of turmoil last year under former Prime Minister Liz Truss as informative, not least since a big portion of Italy\u2019s debt is held by its citizens.\n\u201cThat should act as a strong disincentive to play with fire, and I still have some confidence that this political incentive will hold,\u201d Kraemer said. \u201cIn that sense, Liz Truss was a cautionary tale.\u201d\nMore generally, he says Italy\u2019s challenges are huge, ranging from poor growth and demographics, high borrowing costs, and large pension liabilities and health-care burdens.\nDebt as a percentage of gross domestic product is now seen by the International Monetary Fund as staying above 140%, even five years from now. Without a productivity revolution, its deficits will need to shrink, Kraemer said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a math wizard to figure out where the debt ratio is going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the house is on fire in Italy, but if we extrapolate current trends, it\u2019s going to end in tears.\u201d\n--With assistance from Alice Gledhill.\n(Updates with bond spread in 17th paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

In the past year and a half China has staged two large-scale war games around the island.\nTaiwan's foreign ministry, responding to the Biden-Xi meeting, said the government has never sought to predict whether or when China might attack but was concentrating on boosting its defenses and winning international support.\nThis is to \"let China understand the high importance the international community attaches to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the high price of starting a war, and to not act blindly without thinking,\" ministry spokesperson Jeff Liu said in Taipei.\nTaiwan will neither provoke nor \"advance rashly\" but will also not succumb to pressure, Liu said.\nBiden and Xi met for the first time in a year on Wednesday for talks aimed at easing friction between the two superpowers over military conflicts, drug-trafficking and artificial intelligence, and said they had made \"real progress.\"\nChina has stepped up military activity to try and force democratically governed Taiwan to accept Beijing's sovereignty, despite strong objections from Taipei government, which says only the island's people can decide their future.\nSenior U.S. military officers have said that Xi has ordered the People's Liberation Army to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027. Beijing has not ruled out using force to take the island, though it has never shared details about war preparations.

South Korea's military said the launch appeared to have failed.\nA U.S. Department of State spokesperson said South Korea's decision to suspend part of the agreement was a \"prudent and restrained response,\" citing North Korea's \"failure to adhere to the agreement.\"\n\"The ROK suspension will restore surveillance and reconnaissance activities along the ROK side of the Military Demarcation Line, improving the ROK's ability to monitor DPRK threats,\" the official said, referring to South Korea and North Korea respectively by the initials of their official names.\nThe suspended North-South pact was signed at a 2018 summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and then South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nCritics have said the pact weakened Seoul's ability to monitor North Korea while Pyongyang had violated the agreement.\nNorth Korea said on Tuesday it placed its first spy satellite in orbit, drawing international condemnation for violating U.N. resolutions that bar its use of technology applicable to ballistic missile programs.\nSouth Korea has said the North Korean satellite was believed to have entered orbit, but it would take time to assess whether the satellite was operating normally.\nTuesday's launch was the North's third this year after two previous attempts failed, and followed Kim's visit to Russia, during which President Vladimir Putin promised to help the North build satellites.\nSouth Korean officials said the North Korean launch most likely involved Russian technical assistance under a growing partnership that has seen Pyongyang supply Russia with millions of artillery shells.\nRussia and North Korea have denied arms deals but have promised deeper cooperation.

        "text": "\nPANAMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Panama\u2019s Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday that a 20-year concession for a Canadian copper mine that has been the focus of widespread environmental protests was unconstitutional and the president said later a process to close the mine would begin.\nOpponents of the Cobre Panama mine argued it would damage a forested coastal area and threaten water supplies. The announcement of the nine-member court's decision after four days of deliberations set off cheers among a crowd of people waiting outside and waving Panamanian flags.\n\u201cThis is what we had been waiting for,\u201d demonstrator Raisa Banfield said after what she called an agonizing wait. \u201cThe president has to suspend (mine) operations today.\"\nMinera Panama, the local subsidiary of Canada\u2019s First Quantum Minerals, which operates the mine in central Panama, said in a statement that \u201cCobre Panama acknowledges the court\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to affirm our unwavering commitment to regulatory compliance in all aspects of our operations within the country,\u201d the company wrote. \"We will comment further as additional details on the ruling are made public.\u201d\nPanama President Laurentino Cortizo told the nation Tuesday that as soon as his administration formally receives the court's decision it would be published in the official gazette and a process will begin \u201cfor an orderly and safe closure of the mine.\u201d\nThe mine employs thousands and accounts for 3% of Panama\u2019s gross domestic product.\nIn March, Panama\u2019s legislature reached an agreement with First Quantum allowing Minera Panama to continue operating the huge copper mine for at least 20 more years. The open-pit mine was temporarily closed last year when talks between the government and First Quantum broke down over payments the government wanted.\nThe contract, given final approval Oct. 20, allowed the subsidiary to continue operating the mine in a biodiverse jungle on the Atlantic coast west of the capital for the next 20 years, with the possibility of extending for a further 20 years if the site remained productive.\nThe dispute over the mine led to some of Panama's most widespread protests in recent years, including a blockade of the mine\u2019s power plant. Protesters also blocked parts of the Pan American highway, including a stretch near the border with Costa Rica.\nJust before the ruling was announced, they opened the roadway so freight trucks could get through.\nMinera Panama said in a statement earlier this month that small boats had blocked its port in Colon province, preventing supplies from reaching the mine. Naval police reported that a ship carrying coal decided to turn back due to \u201chostility from a group of protesters who from their boats threw rocks and blunt homemade objects\u201d before being dispersed.\nThe protesters, a broad coalition of Panamanians, feared the mine\u2019s impact on nature and especially on the water supply.\nAfter the protests began, the government nearly passed legislation that would have revoked the contract, but it backtracked in a debate in the National Assembly on Nov. 2.\nA court decision that declared the contract unconstitutional was the last opportunity for opponents to get it thrown out.\nThe Canadian government said it respected Tuesday's ruling and was following the contract negotiation closely. In an email, Jean-Pierre J. Godbout, a spokesperson for the government\u2019s Global Affairs Department, said the government \u201cconsistently hopes for an agreed solution that is beneficial to all parties.\u201d\n___\nRob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

Revenues rose 24% at constant exchange rates in the first half.\nGrowth will be driven by the Asia-Pacific region, while sales in the Americas are expected to weaken further, also due to the conversion of some U.S. stores from wholesale to retail, analysts at Barclays said.\n\"The exit rate for the third quarter is likely to have been weaker due to hot weather. Therefore we think comments about the start of October will be more meaningful to assess underlying trends,\" UBS analysts said, adding that the brand momentum is still strong.\nGiven the importance of coats and winter products, Moncler's retail sales are more concentrated in the first and fourth quarters.\n\"The third quarter is less important than others for Moncler, it would be more serious if mild temperatures were recorded in October, November and December,\" Flavio Cereda, co-investment manager luxury brands at GAM, told Reuters.\nHe added that Moncler is certainly less linked to seasonality than in the past, but the DNA of a company founded as an Alpine mountain goods company remains its outerwear.\nMoncler is preparing to face more extreme climate events and increasingly unpredictable weather.\nIn its last conference call in July, Moncler Business Strategy Chief Roberto Eggs said that the group has an offer of light and warm products for both spring/summer and autumn/winter collections.\n\"We are working also on multilayering, which is something that is adding functionality to our outerwear,\" he added.\n($1 = 0.9421 euros)\n(Reporting by Elisa Anzolin; Editing by Keith Weir and Sharon Singleton)",

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Major League Baseball owners are poised to vote this week on whether to allow the Oakland Athletics to move to Las Vegas, amid lingering questions about the team\u2019s proposed new home stadium and where the club would play while the venue is being built.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nRolex, Patek Prices Hit Fresh Two-Year Lows: Subdial Index\nS&P 500 Up 2% as Bets \u2018Fed Is Done\u2019 Sink US Yields: Markets Wrap\nThailand Takes $28 Billion Malacca Strait Bypass Plan to US\nBiden, Xi to Announce China\u2019s Crackdown on Fentanyl Trade\nTrump Insists on \u2018Disclaimer\u2019 Defense Already Tossed in NY Fraud Trial\nThe 30 owners are convening in Arlington, Texas, starting Tuesday for a quarterly meeting, and the team\u2019s prospective move is on the docket. The club needs to win over at least 75% of the other owners to move ahead with the plan to leave Oakland after 55 years in the Bay Area, all in the same ballpark \u2014 the aging Coliseum.\nJeremy Aguero of Applied Analysis, who\u2019s advising the A\u2019s as well as Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo on efforts to build a stadium in Las Vegas, expects the relocation to win approval. So does Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College, in large part because of what he sees as MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s support for the plan. Sports news site the Athletic reported that the owners are expected to clear the move Thursday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve conducted a great amount of due diligence ahead of the vote,\u201d Aguero said in a telephone interview.\nLombardo approved a $380 million public funding package in June for a new $1.5 billion ballpark, about two months after the team announced its decision to buy land in Las Vegas with the intention of building a stadium. The developments set the stage for this week\u2019s vote, and potentially the end of A\u2019s owner John Fisher\u2019s nearly 20-year quest to find a new home for the team.\nRead more: Oakland\u2019s Baseball Future Hangs on a Waterfront Stadium Deal\nNevada\u2019s financing plan ties the proposed stadium site to the location of what is now the Tropicana Las Vegas Casino Resort, near the Las Vegas Strip on land owned by Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc.\nThe funding would become null and void if MLB owners fail to approve the A\u2019s relocation, or if the team\u2019s agreement with Gaming and Leisure falls through and the A\u2019s need to seek another site. A filing last month from Gaming and Leisure shows their pact with the A\u2019s is contingent on MLB clearing the move before Dec. 1.\nStadium Questions\nAs the owners gather, there are some key aspects of the plan that remain up in the air, such as whether the proposed Las Vegas ballpark will be ready before January 2028, the tentative completion date originally set by the A\u2019s.\nAnother issue is that the team hasn\u2019t secured a temporary home field to use before the planned Las Vegas venue is ready. The A\u2019s were supposed to do that before the vote, ESPN reported in September.\nMLB media representatives didn\u2019t respond to phone calls seeking comment.\nErica George, an A\u2019s spokesperson, said \u201cwe are respecting this process and look forward to having more comments after the vote.\u201d\nOne solution would be for the team to extend its lease at the Coliseum for a few years. However, in exchange for an extension past 2024, Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao wants a guarantee from MLB that the city will receive an expansion team should the A\u2019s move to Nevada.\nMeanwhile, Oakland\u2019s city council passed a resolution this month reaffirming the city\u2019s commitment to keeping the team.\nEven if the relocation bid passes, there are still a number of steps \u2013 including a development agreement, lease agreement, non-relocation agreement and community benefits agreement \u2013 that the Las Vegas Stadium Authority still needs to complete before construction on a new ballpark can commence.\n\u201cThis is not done yet and the A\u2019s can still build a stadium in Oakland where we have not only one but in fact two approved sites that could readily accommodate a ballpark,\u201d said Oakland city council member Rebecca Kaplan.\nClark County, the home of Las Vegas, would issue an estimated $120 million of debt to help pay for the new stadium. Revenue generated from a sports and entertainment improvement district encompassing the venue is expected to help repay the bonds. The remainder of the cost, plus any budget overruns, would be privately financed by Fisher, the A\u2019s owner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nTexas Battles Wall Street in Threat to State\u2019s Muni Market\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

That\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s because it\u2019s very difficult as an American citizen.\u201d\n\u201cChina is a long growth story, I just think as an outsider I\u2019m not going to be able to participate as much as I would like,\u201d he said.\nIndia Offers Manufacturing Opportunities (11:50 a.m. SGT)\nVU Technologies Chairwoman Devita Saraf said she\u2019s a strong supporter of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d push.\nWhile India was a bit slow to get in the manufacturing game, there\u2019s still a big opportunity to manufacture in India, she said. \u201cThere is an opportunity to innovate in design with the talent India has in both hardware and software.\u201d\n\u201cWe lost a couple of decades,\u201d Saraf said. \u201cIndia is not a China-plus-one strategy to replace big factories in China.\u201d\nAsia Needs Gas for Cleaner Future (11:30 a.m. SGT)\nThe energy transition in Asia will require more natural gas to ensure power supply as countries shift away from dirtier coal, according to Japan\u2019s top utility. \u201cWe need natural gas, or LNG, to be placed\u201d in the Asian economy, Toshiro Kudama, chief executive officer of Jera Asia Pte Ltd., said during a panel discussion on energy security. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to support the economic growth of this region \u201d with intermittent renewable sources.\nIn Asia, \u201cit\u2019s not very realistic or very practical to transition immediately from coal to renewable energy resources,\u201d said Yao Lixia, a senior fellow at the National University of Singapore. \u201cSo the most immediate solution may be natural gas.\u201d\nThe major lesson of the energy crisis last year is that sustainability took a back seat to fuel affordability and security, said Yngve Slyngstad, managing director of Industry Capital Partners. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine upended energy markets, sending the price of gas and coal surging and making fuel too expensive for some developing nations. Africa is in the midst of ensuring energy security and can\u2019t currently afford to invest more in the transition, said Fikile Z.

Supply chains are shifting to Southeast Asia, Middle East and the Americas.\nHis company has followed the money flow to conduct acquisitions of payment companies in Mexico. Airwallex has also launched in the Middle East and Latin America. It\u2019s been investing in those regions to set up the infrastructure.\n\u201cGeopolitical issues definitely played a very significant role in these changes in the last two years,\u201d said Zhang, adding that over the last two years there has been a \u201cdramatic\u201d turn in global money flows.\nPwC on Better US-China Ties (8:00 a.m. SGT)\nSigns of increasing cooperation between the world\u2019s two largest economies are having a positive impact on auditing, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers International Ltd. Chairman Bob Moritz.\n\u201cThe US-China relationship has actually brought it to a head where you have access to information for regulators to inspect,\u201d he told Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of the forum. \u201cIt\u2019s going to allow for the inspections to happen, so that tension has decreased quite a bit.\u201d\nThe US audit watchdog has started auditing some firms after Washington and Beijing struck a deal last year following a long-running dispute over U.S.-listed Chinese firms\u2019 auditing compliance. Authorities in China were reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting companies on national security concerns.\nThe World Must Tread Carefully (8 p.m. SGT Wednesday)\nSingapore\u2019s Lee said China isn\u2019t \u201ctrigger happy\u201d in its aim to take over self-governing Taiwan, which it views as its territory. \u201cThey would like Taiwan to be part of \u2018one China,\u2019\u201d but aren\u2019t sure how to make it happen, he said. Unless Beijing is provoked, the world isn\u2019t \u201cgoing to wake up one day and find that they\u2019ve decided to launch D-Day.\u201d\nIn wide-ranging remarks, Lee said there\u2019s no alternative to a two-state solution to ensure peace between Israelis and Palestinians. A one-state solution would mean that \u201cone side or the other has to be squeezed out and that is unimaginable.\u201d He spoke amid global concern about the civilian toll from the Israel-Hamas war, which broke out after Hamas killed more than 1,400 Israelis and took around 240 hostage in a surprise attack. Hamas is designated a terrorist group by the US and European Union.\nOn AI, Lee said that more knowledge and experience of the technology is needed. It\u2019s key to understand that \u201cthe pitfalls are so that we can make smart decisions to regulate it as we go along,\u201d he said, noting that tech people generally know more about AI than do governments.\nThe New Economy Forum is being organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Such Western algorithms, he said, essentially thought Russia did not exist.\n\"Of course, the monopoly and domination of such systems, such alien systems is unacceptable and dangerous,\" he said.\nChina and the United States are far ahead of other countries when it comes to AI research, according to most rankings, though a second tier of European countries as well as India, Russia, Israel, South Korea and Japan also figure in the rankings.\nFor Russia, though, the war in Ukraine and efforts to mobilise combatants triggered an outflow of large numbers of educated Russians while Western sanctions have cut international cooperation with AI powerhouses in the West.\n\"In all spheres of our life, humanity is beginning a new chapter of its existence,\" Putin said of AI, adding that Russia needed to up its game on AI both in ambitions and execution.\n\"In the very near future, as one of the first steps, a presidential decree will be signed and a new version of the national strategy for the development of artificial intelligence will be approved,\" Putin told the conference.\nPutin said the new strategy would make significant changes, including \"expanding fundamental and applied research in the field of generative artificial intelligence and large language models\".\nRussian researchers, he said, should be given better access to supercomputers - which he said needed to be boosted by orders of magnitude - while top level Russian scientific education about AI needed to be improved.\nRussia, he said, would have to change laws, boost international cooperation, and ensure much more investment for the development of AI.\nPutin hailed Sberbank and Yandex for developing their own generative AI and language models - which he said needed to be developed further and applied to sectors of the economy.\nGref is transforming Sberbank, once known as a staid former Soviet savings bank where people queued for hours to pay bills, overseeing investments in AI, cloud services, big data and smart devices. He told Putin in June that Sberbank was making around $3 billion annually from $1 billion in AI investments.\n(Reporting by Guy FaulconbridgeEditing by Gareth Jones and Mark Potter)",

Its best-known game is \"Marvel Snap\", an online card game that amassed a cult following but was not a commercial hit.\nOther titles include action games \"One Piece: The Voyage\" and \"Crystal of Atland\".\nNuverse came into focus again in 2021 when ByteDance formalised its status as one of its six business units under a broader structural overhaul.\nTo build up production capacity, Nuverse acquired external studios including C4games in 2021.\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Brenda Goh and Christopher Cushing)",

        "text": "\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Autoworkers at the first Ford factory to go on strike have voted overwhelmingly in favor of a tentative contract agreement reached with the company.\nMembers of Local 900 at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, west of Detroit voted 82% in favor of the four year-and-eight month deal, the United Auto Workers union said in a statement Thursday. The union said 3,097 workers voted in favor and 683 were against the contract.\nProduction workers voted 81% to ratify the deal, while skilled trades workers voted 90% in favor. Voting by Ford's 57,000 union members will continue through Nov. 17.\nWorkers went on strike at the assembly plant Sept. 15 after the union's contract with Ford expired. They remained on the picket lines until Oct. 25, when the union announced the tentative deal with Ford.\nLocal union leaders from across the country at Jeep maker Stellantis voted unanimously on Thursday to send the contract to members for a vote. General Motors local leaders will meet on Friday. Dates for member voting at GM or Stellantis were not yet clear.\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who follows labor issues, said the vote at the Ford factory is a positive sign for the union.\n\u201cThese workers are deeply in the know about the overall situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that they responded to it with such high levels of approval it is perhaps reflective of how the broader workforce represented by the UAW feels about this contract.\u201d\nMasters says union officials still have to make their cases to the membership, but \u201ccertainly this would appear to be a harbinger of good news.\u201d\nThe deals with all three companies are generally the same, although there are some differences. All give workers 25% general pay raises with 11% upon ratification. With cost of living pay, the raises will exceed 30% by the time the contracts end on April 30, 2028. Workers hired after 2009 without defined benefit pensions will get 10% annual company contributions to 401(k) plans, and they'll get $5,000 ratification bonuses.\nOn Thursday night, Fain and Vice President Rich Boyer told workers in an online presentation that the union\u2019s strikes got every last dime possible out of Stellantis.\nThe top assembly plant wage at the company will go from $31.77 per hour to $42.24 by the end of the contract, Boyer said.\nThe union said it saved jobs at a plant in Belvidere, Illinois, that Stellantis wanted to close. Plus, workers at a new joint-venture electric vehicle battery factory planned for Belvidere will be Stellantis employees and leased to the joint venture, Fain said.\nWorkers at the plant will be under the UAW national contract and will make over $30 per hour by the end of the contract, with the chance to bargain for more later, Fain said.\nFain said terrified auto executives at nonunion plants are raising wages, citing an increase this week at Toyota factories in an effort to keep the UAW from organizing their plants.\n\u201cEven though you're not yet members of our union,\" Fain said to Toyota workers, \"that pay raise Toyota is giving you is the UAW bump. UAW, that stands for \u2018You Are Welcome.\u2019\"\nUAW workers began their strikes with targeted walkouts at all three automakers that escalated during a six-week period in an effort to pressure the companies into a deal. GM was the last company to settle early Sunday morning.\nAt its peak 46,000 union members had gone on strike at eight assembly plants and 38 parts warehouses across the nation. The union has about 146,000 members at all three of the Detroit auto companies.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that 82% of workers at Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant voted in favor of the tentative contract agreement, not 81%.",

        "text": "\nBy Stefania Spezzati and Karin Strohecker\nLONDON (Reuters) - Software firm SUSE, whose clients include Microsoft and BMW, told investors in January it was tightening its scrutiny of commercial deals.\nSUSE, whose software helps large companies run servers, said in its annual report for 2022 that to ensure sales were \"appropriately authorized\" it had created a deal desk \u2013 a department commonly used by software businesses to vet commercial and contractual terms.\nFounded in 1992, SUSE had been publicly traded since 2021 and creating a deal desk aligned it with other listed companies in the sector.\n\"SUSE may enter into high-risk or commercially inappropriate deals if it does not exercise effective control over the Sales organization,\" it said in the report. The company noted that \"'Commercial governance' is a newly identified risk this year\" and a heatmap in the report ranked the risk as \"possible\" and its impact on the business as \"high\".\nReuters wasn't able to establish what prompted that warning.\nNine company documents seen by Reuters relating to two of SUSE's recent sales, as well as interviews with three people with knowledge of the transactions, shed light on some examples of the company's decision-making as it has tried to tighten commercial controls.\nLawyers for SUSE said in a letter to Reuters on Sept. 22 that the creation of the deal desk was \"nothing more than a natural governance maturity exercise, undertaken by a scaling and young listed business\".\nSUSE's majority shareholder, EQT, in August offered to take the software company private after it slashed sales targets this year, its CEO and CFO departed, and its shares plunged. SUSE held an extraordinary meeting on Nov. 13 at which shareholders approved to delist the stock from the exchange.\n\"Execution challenges and several changes during the past twelve months have impacted SUSE's operating performance and market valuation,\" EQT said in a statement on the public offer in August. It added that leaving the public stock market would ease pressure from \"short-term demands\" on the new management. EQT declined to comment for this article.\nIts offer for SUSE shares, which were traded in Frankfurt, valued SUSE at 2.72 billion euros ($3 billion), some 47% below the level of the 2021 IPO. SUSE shares last traded at 10.89 euros on Nov. 13 before the delisting, according to the exchange Deutsche Boerse, 64% below its IPO price.\nSUSE's revenue in the financial year to October 31, 2022 was $653 million. Its 2022 annual report, filed on January 19, said the deal desk should review any deals greater than $500,000. Lawyers for SUSE's former CEO Melissa Di Donato, who stood down on March 21, told Reuters the deal desk was created after a joint decision by the executive team and the company's board.\nAccording to four documents reviewed by Reuters and two of the people with knowledge of the situation, Di Donato greenlighted the commercial terms of a roughly $1.4 million sale to South African utility Eskom in late January, bypassing the deal desk's scrutiny in order to speed the process, less than two weeks after SUSE told investors the desk would help to improve controls.\nOn January 30, after commercial terms of the Eskom deal had been agreed, a senior SUSE executive said in an email to other company officials that the terms had not been submitted to the deal desk.\nIn late February, an executive told colleagues in an email that the sale had not been scrutinized by the deal desk before being agreed but the team would review the terms to familiarize itself with the transaction, according to the documents and two people with knowledge of the transaction.\nThe deal would still be logged into SUSE's systems as approved by Di Donato without sign-off from the deal desk, the executive said. Reuters could not determine if this was done. There was no suggestion in the documents reviewed by the news agency of any problematic issues that arose from the terms of the deal.\nA lawyer for Di Donato said in the letter to Reuters that it was \"highly misleading\" to suggest she had reached the Eskom agreement without submitting it for the deal desk's approval: \"the deal desk was aware of the deal. Nothing was skipped.\" SUSE lawyers didn't address directly whether approval from the deal desk had been skipped on the Eskom transaction.\nA spokesperson for Eskom did not comment on SUSE's due diligence but said that \"Eskom's established processes and governance structures were adhered to during this procurement.\"\nDISCOUNTED DEAL\nAs part of the new risks identified in the annual report, SUSE warned in January that: \"quarter-end pressure may exacerbate the risk as sales staff try to get deals over the line.\"\nThe documents reviewed by Reuters show the efforts SUSE made to clinch one deal: in December 2022 SUSE discounted a sale to Bank of New York Mellon by more than 90% from the listed price.\nSUSE sales growth was slowing at the time. Di Donato agreed to offer BNY Mellon the discount on a package of services originally listed at several million dollars, according to emails and a person familiar with the transaction. Reuters could not determine what SUSE's original offer was.\nUnder the discounted deal, BNY Mellon was offered a one-year package that included SUSE's Platinum service and 10,000 'nodes', according to the documents and one of the people.\nLawyers for Di Donato said \"the scope, the services and the size of the BNY Mellon deal changed from what was originally on offer and, therefore, the final price changed accordingly.\" Di Donato's lawyer added \"it was not part of her responsibilities as the CEO of SUSE to track discounts on deals,\" and \"the discount was approved in collaboration with others\".\nA spokesperson for BNY Mellon declined to comment on the deal.\nLawyers for SUSE did not comment on the terms of the deal, saying it was confidential. Reuters could not determine if the deal was vetted by the deal desk nor how many deals have been going through the unit.\nWithout referring to SUSE specifically, Christian Strenger, director of the Corporate Governance Institute (CGI) at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, said that software-related services companies, in particular, have pressure to meet quarterly and year-end performance targets as they often rely on large individual sales.\nDi Donato's lawyers said that quarter-end pressures affected all companies: \"Our client has never forced a sales team to close a deal that was not good for the business.\"\nSUSE and Reuters parent company, Thomson Reuters, are involved in litigation over the use of SUSE software products. SUSE claims that Thomson Reuters breached the terms that allegedly governed its use of SUSE software products.\n($1 = 0.9096 euros)\n(Reporting by Karin Strohecker and Stefania Spezzati; Additional reporting by Emma-Victoria Farr; Editing by Elisa Martinuzzi and Daniel Flynn)",

Scholz's government has pledged to double support for Kyiv to 8 billion euros ($8.76 billion) next year.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock later told a NATO meeting in Brussels that Germany would bring its defence spending up to the alliance's target of 2% of gross domestic product next year.\n'ROLE MODEL'\nCDU leader Friedrich Merz accused Scholz's government of a brazen attempt to circumvent borrowing rules and said its behaviour risked undermining the European Union's wider fiscal reforms in upcoming negotiations.\n\"If the dams burst in Germany, they will also not hold in all other countries in the currency union,\" Merz said. \"Germany has a function as a role model there.\"\nGermany had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 65% in 2022, compared with 117% for France, 148% for Italy and 116% for Spain, OECD data show.\nHendrik Wuest, CDU premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said the government had ruined Germany's reputation as an anchor of stability in just two years. \"The international damage is huge,\" he told the Rheinische Post newspaper.\nMemories of how frugality paved the way for postwar reconstruction and how costly it was to re-integrate indebted ex-communist East Germany have shaped a uniquely debt-averse political culture.\nIn order to keep supporting industry, Finance Minister Christian Lindner has ruled out tax rises and said savings would have to be found elsewhere, backed up by potentially difficult welfare reforms.\n\"We had no room for manouevre even before the ruling,\" Christoph Landscheidt, head of the local government association in North Rhine-Westphalia, told the Rheinische Post. \"We've never before had such a pile-up of crises, all placing massive demands on local government budgets.\"\nCoalition party leaders are due to meet on Wednesday evening to thrash out a path to the 2024 budget. Their popularity has sagged during a period of weak economic performance, rising inflation and higher interest rates.\nBut offering some reprieve, a new survey by Forsa suggested only just over a third of Germans believe a CDU-led government could handle the budget crisis better than the ruling coalition, while 59% did not.\n($1 = 0.9134 euros) (Reporting by Andreas Rinke, Christian Kraemer, Miranda Murray, Rachel More, Maria Martinez, Alex Ratz; Writing by Matthias Williams and Thomas Escritt; editing by Kirsti Knolle, Bernadette Baum, Alex Richardson and Tomasz Janowski)",

The profit potential from this trade is staggering,\" trader Dave Reiter with Reiter Capital Investments LLC said on X, formerly Twitter, referring to the position some investors built on the contract.\n\"OJ is very thinly traded. Not extremely hard to move the market like it is with corn or soybeans,\" said Darin Fessler, SVP, Market Strategist at Lakefront Futures & Options.\nThe January OJ position, for example, had an open interest of 8,111 lots at the end of trading on Monday. As a comparison, the most traded contract among the soft commodities, ICE's raw sugar, had over 435,000 lots in open interest.\nBeyond the speculative game, however, fundamentals are extremely positive, with negative weather and a bacterial disease called greening having reduced production in the three main growers Mexico, U.S. and Brazil. Florida's production has also been hit by hurricanes in recent years.\nIbiapaba Netto, executive director at CitrusBR, the association representing Brazilian juice producers, said that a reversal of the current tight supply situation would take time, and is not certain to happen.\nBrazil has a 75% share of the global orange juice trade.\nNetto said fruit producers are afraid to invest to expand orchards fearing the greening disease.\n\"Our last large crop was five years ago.

It\u2019s part of a network of plants that pass water and nutrients to each other, even allowing trees to \u201ccommunicate,\u201d according to the National Forest Foundation.\nMushrooms, the fairytale home of garden gnomes, are a byproduct that grows on the surface.\nResearchers are leveraging the growth properties of the organism to create mycocrete, an ingenious paste that, when dried, is \u201cstronger and more versatile\u201d than other fungi biomaterials.\n\u201cOur ambition is to transform the look, feel and wellbeing of architectural spaces using mycelium in combination with biobased materials such as wool, sawdust, and cellulose,\u201d Newcastle\u2019s Dr. Jane Scott said in a university report.\nThe process is quite the biology experiment. Scientists take mycelium spores and mix them with materials the spores can devour and grow on, including grains.\nThis mixture is put into a mold and placed in a room that might resemble your basement right now \u2014 warm, dark, and humid. The mycelium grows to form and is dried, creating a building material that could be a cleaner fill-in for foam, timber, or plastic, per Newcastle research.\nIn this innovation, the experts have improved the process by using flexible, tube-shaped knitted molds, which are hung from a frame. This allows for more oxygen to enter, helping to create what the experts call mycocrete, CleanTechnica reported.\nThe team proved the concept through a unique build called BioKnit, which was tested for strength, outperforming past samples. It\u2019s a \u201ccomplex freestanding dome constructed in a single piece without [joints] that could prove to be weak points, thanks to the flexible knitted form,\u201d according to Newcastle experts.\nIt looks sort of like a birdcage. A university photo shows two people sitting inside it.\nIf this fungus can prove versatile enough to replace concrete in even a portion of our buildings, the results could be impactful. Princeton University reported that concrete is the \u201cmost consumed\u201d product on Earth, not counting water. The concrete industry contributes 4.4 billion tons of air pollution a year, per Princeton.\nThe experts must create the right mycelium mix for buildings, before it goes mainstream.\nIt\u2019s \u201ca significant result, and a step toward the use of mycelium and textile biohybrids within construction,\u201d Scott said in the university report.\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

        "text": "\nBy Paul Sandle, Martin Coulter\nBLETCHLEY PARK, England (Reuters) -China agreed to work with the United States, European Union and other countries to collectively manage the risk from artificial intelligence at a British summit on Wednesday aimed at charting a safe way forward for the rapidly evolving technology.\nSome tech executives and political leaders have warned the rapid development of AI poses an existential threat to the world if not controlled, sparking a race by governments and international institutions to design safeguards and regulation.\nIn a first for Western efforts to manage its safe development, a Chinese vice minister joined U.S. and EU leaders and tech bosses such as Elon Musk and ChatGPT's Sam Altman at Bletchley Park, home of Britain's World War Two code-breakers.\nMore than 25 countries present, including the United States and China, as well as the EU, signed a \"Bletchley Declaration\" saying countries needed to work together and establish a common approach on oversight.\nThe declaration set out a two-pronged agenda focused on identifying risks of shared concern and building scientific understanding of them, while also developing cross-country policies to mitigate them.\nWu Zhaohui, China's vice minister of science and technology, told the opening session of the two-day summit that Beijing was ready to increase collaboration on AI safety to help build an international \"governance framework\".\n\"Countries regardless of their size and scale have equal rights to develop and use AI,\" he said.\nFears about the impact AI could have on economies and society took off in November last year when Microsoft-backed OpenAI made ChatGPT available to the public.\nUsing natural language processing tools to create human-like dialogue, it has stoked fears, including among some AI pioneers, that machines could in time achieve greater intelligence than humans, leading to unlimited, unintended consequences.\nGovernments and officials are now trying to chart a way forward alongside AI companies which fear being weighed down by regulation before the technology reaches its full potential.\n\"I don't know what necessarily the fair rules are, but you've got to start with insight before you do oversight,\" the billionaire Musk told reporters, adding that a \"third-party referee\" could be used to sound the alarm when risks develop.\nWhile the European Union has focused its AI oversight on data privacy and surveillance and their potential impact on human rights, the British summit is looking at so-called existential risks from highly capable general-purpose models called \"frontier AI\".\nMustafa Suleyman, the cofounder of Google Deepmind, told reporters he did not think current AI frontier models posed any \"significant catastrophic harms\" but said it made sense to plan ahead as the industry trains ever larger models.\nCODE-BREAKER VENUE\nThe summit is the brainchild of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who wants to carve out a post-Brexit role for his country as an intermediary between the economic blocs of the United States, China and the EU.\nBritish digital minister Michelle Donelan said it was an achievement just to get so many key players in one room. She announced two further AI Safety Summits, one to be held in South Korea in six months and another in France six months after that.\n\"For the first time, we now have countries agreeing that we need to look not just independently but collectively at the risk around frontier AI,\" Donelan told reporters.\nJust as tech companies compete for dominance in AI, governments are jostling to lead the way on regulation.\nChina is a key participant at the summit, given the country's role in developing AI. But some British lawmakers have questioned whether it should be there given the low level of trust between Beijing, Washington and many European capitals when it comes to Chinese involvement in technology.\nThe United States made clear on the eve of the summit that the call to Beijing had very much come from Britain, with its Ambassador to London, Jane Hartley, telling Reuters: \"This is the UK invitation, this is not the U.S.\"\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's decision to give a speech in London on Wednesday about her government's response to AI, and hold some meetings with attendees away from the summit, meaning they may have to leave early, also raised some eyebrows.\nSachin Dev Duggal, founder of London-based AI firm Builder.ai said it risked undermining the event's core focus, while some lawmakers from Sunak's Conservative Party suggested Washington was trying to overshadow his summit.\nBritish officials denied that, saying they wanted as many voices as possible.\nJust days after U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order on AI, his government used the British summit to announce it would launch a U.S. AI Safety Institute.\nHarris will meet Sunak later on Wednesday, including for dinner, and attend the summit's second day on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Paul Sandle, Martin Coulter, William James, Sachin Ravikumar; writing by Kate HoltonEditing by Mark Potter, Elizabeth Piper and Catherine Evans)",

Expectations for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points have grown to more than 50% at the May 2024 meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\nMarkets will look for more clarity on the Fed's intentions from officials speaking later in the week, including Chair Jerome Powell, and voting members such as New York Fed chief John Williams and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan.\n\"Unless something in the economic data prompts it, you won't see them change their tone,\" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.\nExpectations the Fed was likely done with rate hikes sent the S&P 500 up 5.85% last week and the Nasdaq up 6.61%, their biggest weekly jumps since November 2022.\n\"Whatever that buying force was that sort of went rampant on Friday is not around today and so a lot of these names are drifting back down, and yields are a little higher,\" said Massocca.\nMeanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note , which slid to five-week lows on Friday, reversed course to reach a high near 4.67% on Monday, ahead of this week's Treasury auction of about $112 billion in three-year and 10-year notes, as well as 30-year bonds.\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 8.71 points, or 0.20%, to end at 4,367.05 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 42.12 points, or 0.31%, to 13,518.78.

        "text": "\nBy Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Bond investors are pricing in imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts by the first half of next year, as signs of slowing U.S. economic growth and easing inflation became more evident.\nWhile a weakening growth outlook is likely an important factor in keeping the U.S. central bank from raising rates, progress on the inflation front could determine when it will pivot toward monetary policy easing.\nThe release on Thursday of the latest U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, could mark another step closer to that looming policy shift.\nThe PCE price index was unchanged in October after climbing 0.4% in September. In the 12 months through October, it rose 3.0%, the smallest year-on-year gain since March 2021 and a sharp drop from the 3.4% reading in September.\n\"The Fed is on hold, and (this report) gives them more comfort in staying on hold. What they're doing is working,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager, Dakota Wealth Management in Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\"The data is trending in the direction that the Fed wants to see,\" Pavlik said. \"A 25- to 50 basis-point cut before the end of the summer 2024 would make sense as the economy slows down, for the Fed to fine tune how their policy tools are working.\"\nTraders' confidence was reinforced earlier this week when Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a hawkish policymaker, flagged a possible rate cut in the months ahead.\nMarkets will be looking to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Friday at Spelman College in Atlanta to see whether he doubles down on Waller's comments or pushes back.\nHere is how Fed policy expectations are playing out in different corners of the bond and money markets:\nFED FUNDS FUTURES\nFederal funds futures are the most straightforward measure of determining of where traders believe the U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate will be in the future. That market has priced in about a 45% chance of a rate cut at the March 19-20, 2024 meeting, rising to about a 75% probability at the April 30-May 1 meeting, the CME FedWatch Tool showed on Thursday. Overall, the rates market sees a roughly 100 basis points (bps) of cuts by the end of 2024, according to LSEG data.\nYIELD CURVE\nThe current yield curve measuring the gap between yields on U.S. two-year and 10-year Treasury notes has narrowed its inversion for the past several weeks. An inversion of this part of the curve is viewed by many as a reliable signal that a recession is likely to follow in one to two years.\nBut the yield curve has been reducing its inversion as investors start to price in the end of the Fed's tightening cycle. It was last at minus 38.50 bps.\nMarket participants referred to the yield curve's move in the last few weeks as a \"bull steepener,\" a scenario in which short-term yields are falling faster than long-term ones. This often happens when the Fed is expected to cut interest rates, analysts said.\nSOFR FUTURES\nBond investors also look to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) futures to gauge expectations of Fed rate moves. The March 2024 SOFR futures have priced in a 50% chance of a 25 basis-point cut at the March meeting.\nThe June 2024 SOFR futures have priced at least one Fed cut, while the probability of two 25-basis-point rate reductions was at 76%.\nSOFR, a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, replaced the prior benchmark rate, Libor, on June 30 after a rate-fixing scandal by bankers at several major financial institutions came to light in 2012. It's now the backbone of U.S. corporate borrowing.\nOIS FORWARDS\nThe overnight index swap (OIS) forwards market, another corner of the fixed income market that shows traders' rate expectations, is also pricing in rate cuts starting in March.\nAn OIS transaction involves exchanging an overnight rate such as the federal funds rate for a fixed one. For instance, in a U.S. two-year OIS transaction, one party receives a fixed two-year rate in exchange for paying the fed funds rate daily over the next two years.\nThe three-month by six-month OIS forward is factoring more than a 40% chance of a 25-basis-point cut by the Fed's March meeting, LSEG data showed. The longer-dated six-month by nine-month OIS showed 100% odds of at least one rate cut by June, while the chances of two rate cuts by the middle of next year are at 78%.\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Stephen Culp; Editing by Alden Bentley and Paul Simao)",

        "text": "\n(Adds White House readout of Sullivan-Milei meeting in paragraph 4)\nBy Jason Lange and Rodrigo Campos\nWASHINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Argentina's president-elect Javier Milei met on Tuesday with top U.S. officials in Washington and his economic team huddled with IMF officers as he seeks to formulate a plan to reshape the country's foreign policy and lead its economy out of crisis.\nMilei told reporters as he left the White House that his meeting had been \"excellent.\" Among those in attendance were national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council's senior director for the Western Hemisphere.\n\"We talked about the economic and social conditions in Argentina at the moment,\" Milei said in brief comments before he was whisked off in his official car. Milei aligned himself with Western values, his office later said.\nThe White House said Sullivan and Milei had discussed during their meeting the importance of building on a strong bilateral relationship on economic issues and shared priorities such as investment in clean energy and technology.\nMilei, a far-right libertarian who takes office on Dec. 10, won election this month pledging radical reforms such as dollarization and \"shock\" austerity to fix Argentina's economy. Inflation is near 150%, foreign currency reserves are in the red and a recession is looming.\nHis foreign policy, meanwhile, is unabashedly pro-United States and pro-Israel, with a cooler stance on top trade partners Brazil and China.\n\"Milei is a unicorn, the leader of a major Latin American economy who is ostentatiously pro-American,\" said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America program at Washington-based think-tank the Wilson Center.\nWhile Milei's incoming team has looked to moderate earlier criticism of China and Brazil's leftist government, the U.S. trip ahead of his inauguration underscores his priorities.\nHe has also pledged not to join the China-led BRICS trade group. That's a sharp change in approach from outgoing center-left President Alberto Fernandez, who visited Moscow as Vladimir Putin was readying his invasion of Ukraine in February last year and recently returned from a visit to Beijing.\nTHE $44 BILLION QUESTION\nMilei also needs to get the country's $44 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund back on track, with support from the U.S. - the IMF's largest shareholder - key to any revamp.\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said earlier on Tuesday that she would meet Milei at the lender's headquarters, but the meeting did not happen. The IMF did not respond to a request for comment on the missed meeting.\nEconomic advisors to Milei, Nicol\u00e1s Posse and Luis Caputo, met with the IMF's No. 2 Gita Gopinath and other fund officials, the fund said separately.\n\"They discussed the country's complex challenges and plans for urgently strengthening stability and setting the basis for more sustainable growth,\" the IMF said in a statement.\nA U.S. Treasury official confirmed that Milei's advisors met with Treasury officials to discuss the president-elect's economic agenda, but declined to provide details. The Treasury manages the dominant U.S. shareholding in the IMF.\nArgentina is by far the largest global debtor to the Washington-based lender but its program has ran off the tracks, and the IMF has been losing patience. The program is used mostly to pay the Fund back for a failed $57 billion program from 2018.\nDuring his campaign Milei vowed to dollarize South America's second-largest economy, though he seems to have put that on the back burner while he looks to overturn a deep fiscal deficit and tamp down inflation. He has stuck, however, to pledges that he will radically change the mandate of the central bank.\nThe IMF has said in the past that dollarization is not a substitute for sound macroeconomic policy. Lack of an orthodox policy framework under the current administration and a sharp increase in central bank-financed spending in the run-up to the presidential election further hurt the Argentine economy.\nMilei and IMF officials had a first virtual meeting on Friday, which Georgieva called a \"very constructive engagement\".\nMilei's office said the meeting with the IMF was part of protocol to explain the incoming team's economic plan and not in search for more financing.\nGeorgieva, however, told Reuters in an interview that the IMF was \"very keen\" to support Argentina and the country could be a candidate to receive a relatively small amount of extra financing through a trust for middle-income countries.

That process has gradually grown more arduous, with rejections increasingly common, because the UAE is showing less appetite for sanctions-related risk and pushing to get off the so-called gray list, according to more than half a dozen business owners and consultants interviewed by Bloomberg, who asked not to be identified as such information isn\u2019t public.\nMoney transfers \u2014 whether for companies repatriating funds to Russia or moving cash to a third country \u2014 have also been subject to greater oversight and now take more time, the people said. Some banks are demanding more documentation, and at times blocking funds, while seeking justification for the transfer or questioning the origin of the money, they said.\nIn the initial aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, UAE officials hewed to policies that attracted a surge of inflows from high net worth individuals. In recent months, officials have looked to close perceived gaps in sanctions compliance, the people said, as the UAE seeks to be removed from a list of jurisdictions subject to more oversight maintained by the Financial Action Task Force, a group that aims to combat global money laundering.\nIn the meantime, the US, UK and European Union have ramped up pressure on Emirati officials to tackle illicit flows and close channels used by Moscow to skirt trade sanctions and finance the Kremlin\u2019s war machine. This month, the Biden administration targeted several UAE-based shipping firms, part of a crackdown on non-compliance with its oil price cap.\n\u201cIn terms of financial compliance, it has become much more difficult to be Russian in the UAE, and the situation is getting tougher,\u201d said Daria Nevskaya, a Dubai-based lawyer who consults with clients on cross-border deals and bank accounts. \u201cSome banks that previously had been accepting payments from Russia have put a stop to such transactions now.\u201d\nIn response to questions from Bloomberg, a UAE official said the country takes it role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system extremely seriously. \u201cThe increased resources and expertise we have put in place underpin the UAE\u2019s continued commitment to combating economic crime and disrupting illicit networks, both at home and abroad,\u201d the official said.\nRead more: EU Says UAE to Curb Key Exports to Russia Used in War in Ukraine\nAs part of the FATF proceedings, UAE banks are requesting more information from current and prospective clients, including specific checks related to sanctions lists, Thani Al Zeyoudi, the country\u2019s minister of state for foreign trade, told Bloomberg on Tuesday.\nWhile that\u2019s true for clients of every nationality, the situation can be particularly acute for Russians because of the volume of country-specific sanctions, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\u201cThe UAE has been very good at usually doing just about enough to escape serious censure while also being as open to business from all sides as they can,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. \u201cMore due diligence and cutting links with clear sanctions evaders will be enough to avoid any escalation with the US.\u201d\nThe policy shift has hit smaller businesses particularly hard because of lenders\u2019 risk-reward calculations, according to Michael Malinovskiy, a partner at Lecap law firm.\nSome larger businesses are now weighing alternatives.\nThe UAE\u2019s crackdown on illicit activities in its bullion market and US measures against Russia\u2019s top gold miners led to a shift in trading from Dubai to Hong Kong since April, two people involved in the industry said. More rigorous oversight of bank transfers and a mandatory government database for monitoring cash payments have increased hurdles for Russian exporters in the UAE, people familiar with the matter said.\nAnother of Russia\u2019s biggest mining companies, which has sanctioned shareholders, has been struggling to open a bank account for months, two people familiar with the situation said.\nGazprombank, which has escaped the strictest restrictions due to its role in commodities trading, had one of its correspondent accounts closed by Dubai-based bank Mashreq, a person with direct knowledge of the situation said, declining to be identified as the information isn\u2019t public. The lender has accounts at two other UAE banks for now, the person said, adding that he thinks Dubai banks are closing for Russian money.\nGazprombank\u2019s media relations staff and Mashreq didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment.\nTo be sure, the UAE is still a favored hub for many of Russia\u2019s biggest unsanctioned companies. United Co. Rusal International PJSC is shifting its global aluminum trading headquarters to Dubai from Switzerland, while EuroChem Group AG, one of the country\u2019s biggest fertilizer producers, has run its trading operations through Dubai for more than a year. The Uralchem-Uralkali fertilizer group has had its international trading unit based in Dubai\u2019s DMCC free trade zone since 2021.\nStill, closer scrutiny from UAE authorities is pushing some mid-size businesses to move to neighboring Gulf countries, such as Oman or Bahrain, which aren\u2019t under the US government\u2019s spotlight, the people said.\n\u201cThe UAE still is a very useful hub to have for Russia, notably the rich elites around Putin,\u201d Hertog said. \u201cRussia probably needs the UAE more than the other way around at this point, but there is still need for Russian cooperation vis-a-vis Iran, Syria, Libya and other regional hot spots.\u201d\n--With assistance from Abeer Abu Omar.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

For buyers on a budget, there were colorful landscapes being offered for less than $100.\nThe dealer hawking the art made no effort to disguise who produced the pieces, despite stiff U.N. sanctions prohibiting the sale of such goods: \u201cThey were painted over there,\" the dealer said, \u201cin North Korea.\u201d\nThe dealer, who had salt-and-pepper hair and refused to divulge his name, was a representative of an art gallery that trumpets itself as China\u2019s premier seller of North Korean art. The gallery, The Paintings Say Arirang, also operates a studio for North Korean artists in the outskirts of Beijing.\nHoused in a fenced and heavily surveilled compound, the North Koreans paint glorified, idyllic visions of life back home. For the right price, the Arirang studio says, the artists will render \u201cexquisite\" portraits at \u201cunimaginable prices.\"\nThe gallery's existence and conspicuous sales tactics, experts say, highlight China\u2019s lax enforcement of U.N. sanctions targeting North Korea to stymie Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program. A. The U.N. has sanctioned a long list of North Korean goods, including arms, coal and art. The U.N. has also sought to block North Koreans from working overseas in the hopes of preventing North Korea from garnishing the wages of such laborers to fund its nuclear program. U.N. report in March singled out Arirang for selling North Korean art and hosting North Korean artists in apparent violation of sanctions.\nChina has a long history of rebuffing efforts by the U.N. to rein in such suspected sanctions violators, and last year vetoed a U.N. resolution that would have toughened such restrictions. The U.N. reported that Arirang did not respond to requests for information.\nArirang was not hard for the U.N. to find. That's because the gallery is actively seeking to tap a niche audience drawn to the unique, socialist realist style of North Korean artists.\nArirang was founded by Jin Zhe, an ethnic Korean and art lover born in China near the North Korean border, according to posts written by Jin on Arirang\u2019s website. The son of a prominent painter, Jin spent years at a Chinese state-run radio station before a trip to Pyongyang instilled a taste for North Korean art. Jin, Arirang\u2019s director, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nAn Arirang employee told The AP by phone that the studio was in operation and offered a tour of the complex. She also said the studio was selling customized portraits by its North Korean artists. The employee, a woman identifying herself as surnamed Shen, changed her story a few days later, saying the base wasn\u2019t in operation because \u201cbusiness is bad.\u201d\nWhen AP journalists visited the \u201cpainting base,\u201d guards turned them away.\nIn lengthy posts on Chinese chat application WeChat, the art gallery expounds at length on the beauty rendered by North Korean artists because they are free from the fetters of the \u201cmarket economy.\u201d\n\u201cThey do not compare who is richer than the other, but simply focus on pure aesthetics,\u201d Arirang wrote on WeChat. \u201cThey regard the pursuit of art as a mission of spiritual civilization,\u201d not vulgar commodification.\nSuch art is exceptionally valuable, Arirang said, \u201cbecause of its superb realistic skills, high-cost performance, high collection value and other advantages.\u201d\nIn most countries, art is seen as a form of self-expression. But in North Korea it is strictly regulated. Artists work directly for North Korea\u2019s propaganda authorities, and their mission is to create art glorifying the state and its socialist, nationalist ideology.\nTheir work also provides income for the North Korean state.\n\u201cAll artists in North Korea are slaves to the Party,\u201d said Song Byeok, a dissident artist who painted propaganda posters in North Korea until he fled to the South two decades ago. \u201cNorth Korean art is a tool of the Kim family, with no identity of its own.\u201d\nPosts on Arirang provide glimpses of the artists\u2019 lives in China. In one photo, they raise glasses of beer around sizzling barbecue. Others show them playing ping pong or visiting historic monuments and bustling market streets.\nNearly a thousand paintings had been rendered in Arirang\u2019s \u201cpainting base,\u201d Jin wrote wrote on WeChat. The artists work hard, often refusing breaks, the gallery\u2019s director added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very relaxing, no worries,\u201d Jin recounted one artist saying.\nAnother told Jin that they can\u2019t sleep until they were done, Jin said.\nBG Muhn, an expert in North Korean art at Georgetown University, said artists enjoy special care and respect in North Korean society.\n\u201cThe interesting thing is they don\u2019t consider themselves doing propaganda art,\u201d said Muhn, who met artists on nine trips to North Korea. \u201cThey feel they are doing art for the country, to serve the country and the people.\u201d\nFor decades, North Korean art was created largely for North Korean audiences. That changed in the 1990s when Pyongyang\u2019s biggest benefactor, the Soviet Union, collapsed. North Korea desperately needed cash, so it turned to its artists.\nThe government organized teams of artists to go to friendly countries in Africa and the Middle East, where they erected sculptures and painted murals eulogizing local leaders. Those efforts were financially lucrative. At the same time, the private art market took an interest, especially after South Korea began encouraging trade with its northern neighbor. Tens of thousands of paintings began flowing into South Korea, often through Chinese dealers.\nAfter Kim Jong Un took power in 2011, Pyongyang began loosening its grip on the artists\u2019 creativity. They were told they no longer had to make portraits glorifying state leaders. Business boomed: Pyongyang\u2019s state-run Mansudae studio outfitted a museum in Cambodia and was paid to erect statutes of soldiers and dictators in Senegal, the Congo, Angola, and over a dozen other sites across Africa. North Korea reaped tens of millions of dollars in art sales.\nThat success evaporated when the U.N. slapped sanctions on Pyongyang in 2016 and 2017 after a series of nuclear and missile tests. Detectives questioned an art dealer in Italy and seized paintings in South Korea. Pyongyang\u2019s art exports slowed, then ground to a halt when North Korea sealed its borders during the pandemic.\nBut there are signs that North Korea\u2019s isolation is thawing. China\u2019s relations with North Korea have warmed as ties with the West have soured. Moscow is courting Pyongyang, with Kim visiting Russia in September to discuss arms sales amid the war with Ukraine.\nArt and cultural exchanges are now resuming, Jin wrote recently.\n\u201cArt is becoming an important way for the outside world to understand North Korea,\u201d Jin wrote on WeChat. \u201cThrough unremitting effort and by expanding their horizons, North Korean artists will definitely go abroad and out into the world.\u201d\n___\nCorrects to say that North Korean landscape paintings were being sold at a Beijing art exposition for less than a hundred dollars, not a few hundred dollars.\nAP writer Alan Suderman contributed to this story from Washington.\nContact AP\u2019s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org",

China is trialling a prototype digital yuan with 200 million users, while the European Central Bank has just begun two years of advanced-stage exploratory work.\n\"Issuing a CBDC will have major implications for the business model of central banks and the risks they face, and it will modify their risk profiles,\" the BIS report said.\nIt added that CBDCs using new technologies such as distributed ledger technology (DLT) will face \"unique cyber risks\" as there is no widely accepted cyber security framework currently.\nFurthermore, central banks are flying somewhat blind as there is \"limited real world data on the key threats to CBDCs, regardless of the type of technology they use.\"\n(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Christina Fincher)",

Rich countries had previously signalled the target would not be met until 2023.\nThe goal is politically symbolic and failure to meet it has stoked mistrust in past climate talks, hampering other deals to tackle climate change as poorer nations argue the world's economic powers are leaving them in the lurch.\nThe data come two weeks ahead of the United Nations' COP28 climate summit, which starts in Dubai on Nov. 30.\nFinance is a sore point in U.N. climate talks, as developing economies say they cannot adapt to extreme weather or invest in cleaner energy without more support from the rich nations whose historical fossil fuel burning caused climate change.\n\"Based on preliminary and as yet unverified data, the goal looks likely to have already been met as of 2022,\" said Mathias Cormann, Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nThe $100 billion is far below poor nations' actual climate investment needs, which by 2025 could total $1 trillion per year, the OECD said.\n\"The delivery of the $100 billion is vitally important,\" said Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, a nation vulnerable to rising sea levels.\n\"From building sea walls to adapt to climate change, to installing renewables, to helping people rebuild their lives and livelihoods if they're forced to move \u2013 all of these things cost money,\" she said.\nThe OECD confirmed the target was not met in 2021. That year, wealthy nations provided $89.6 billion, an 8% increase from 2020 levels.\nMost of the 2021 money - $73 billion - was public finance and, of this, more than two thirds was loans.\nThe OECD warned, however, that this funding - from sources including multilateral development banks and national aid agencies - has so far failed to mobilise substantial private capital, which is needed to cover the climate investment gap.

It does raise the risk of the BOJ stepping into the (forex) market to strengthen the yen, but I think markets are expecting no intervention unless dollar/yen moves to about 152,\" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\nThe Aussie and the kiwi were likewise headed for a 2.3% and 1.75% weekly decline against the dollar respectively, also their steepest drop in months.\n\"Even though we don't expect Powell to deliver on the tightening bias, that tightening bias does support the dollar,\" said Kong.\nThe Australian dollar last stood at $0.63615 after slipping to a one-week low of $0.6352 earlier in the session, while the New Zealand dollar was last at $0.5895, having similarly hit a one-week trough of $0.5886 earlier.\nFalling oil prices and a faltering economic recovery in China have also kept a lid on the Antipodean currencies.\nAustralia's central bank, in its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy released on Friday, warned there were risks of further upside surprises to inflation following its latest hike in interest rates, though investors remained doubtful.\nElsewhere, the euro steadied at $1.06665, while sterling rose 0.05% to $1.2227. They were both on track to lose roughly 0.6% and 1.2% for the week, respectively.\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, meanwhile held near an 18-month high and last bought $36,653, having peaked at $37,978 in the previous session, its highest level since May 2022.\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency Ether jumped to its highest since April at $2,136.50.\nPrices of the digital assets have surged on swirling speculation of an imminent approval of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, with the asset management giant also having registered to create an ethereum trust.\n\"The potential approval of spot ETFs by the (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) could significantly impact the cryptocurrency sector,\" said Carl Szantyr, managing partner of digital asset hedge fund Blockstone Capital.\n\"Such an endorsement would make it more accessible for institutional investors to enter the crypto space, likely boosting demand and subsequently, prices.\"\n(Reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Kim Coghill)",

According to the United Nations, more than 1.8 million have been displaced by military offensives, which critics charge have involved gross violations of human rights.\nWar crimes have become easier to document in recent years thanks largely to the ubiquity of cellphone cameras and the near-universal access to social media, where photo and video evidence can easily be posted and viewed.\nBut it's harder to establish who is responsible for such crimes, especially generals and other high-ranking officers behind the scenes who make the plans and give the orders.\n\u201cGenerals and lower ranking officers should fear being dragged before a court of law and imprisoned for crimes they ordered or authorized,\u201d Tom Andrews, the United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, told the AP by email. \u201cResearch must move beyond merely stating the obvious \u2014 that crimes are occurring \u2014 and connect those who are responsible to specific atrocities. The victims of these crimes deserve justice and that will require the research necessary to hold those responsible fully accountable.\u201d\nThe new website, myanmar.securityforcemonitor.org, is an interactive online version of a report, \u201cUnder Whose Command? \u2014 Human rights abuses under Myanmar\u2019s military rule,\u201d compiled by Security Force Monitor, a project of the Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute, to connect alleged crimes with their perpetrators.\nThe project\u2019s team constructed a timeline of senior commanders and their postings, which can be correlated with documented instances of alleged atrocities that occurred under their commands. It exposes the army\u2019s chain of command, identifying senior army commanders and showing the connections from alleged rights violations to these commanders, study director Tony Wilson told The Associated Press in an email interview.\n\u201cThis is one of the pieces of the jigsaw that has up until now been missing in terms of accountability \u2014 demonstrating how the system works and that these abuses are not just the result of rogue units or individual soldiers,\u201d he said.\nWilson said the Myanmar data show that 65%, or 51 of all 79 senior army commanders between the end of March 2011 and the end of March this year, \u201chad alleged disappearances, killings, rape or instances of torture committed by units under their command.\u201d\nHe said the study also shows the officer with the most links to serious human rights violations is Gen. Mya Htun Oo, who became defense minister and a member of the ruling military council when the army seized power in 2021. He also became deputy prime minister in 2023.\nThe legal significance leans on the established doctrine of \u201ccommand responsibility,\u201d which allows the prosecution under international law of military commanders for war crimes perpetrated by their subordinates.\n\u201cEstablishing the command structures of militaries and other groups involved in atrocities is the lifeblood of properly conducting investigations into international crimes,\u201d Mark Kersten, assistant professor of criminology and criminal justice at Canada\u2019s University of the Fraser Valley, said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cWhen the Nazis were prosecuted at Nuremberg, the lead counsel for the Allies famously exclaimed that it was individuals who would be prosecuted for atrocities, and not abstract entities, namely states.\u201d\nCollecting evidence of human rights violations in Syria\u2019s civil war has served as a guide to utilizing online information and technical advances to gather and organize evidence of war crimes. Similar projects have also been launched in other areas of conflict including Sudan, Yemen and Ukraine.\nSince 2021, evidence-gathering groups have formed in Myanmar, including Myanmar Witness, an NGO that seeks to \u201ccollect, analyse, verify and store evidence related to human rights incidents \u2026 in a way that is compatible with future human rights prosecutions.\u201d\nSimilar work for Myanmar has already been done by groups documenting the security forces\u2019 brutal 2017 counterinsurgency campaign in the western part of the country that drove an estimated 740,000 Rohingya to seek safety across the border in Bangladesh. Several international tribunals have been considering charges of genocide and other crimes brought against the army for their activities.\n\u201cOur work can complement and feed into the work of documenting abuses,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cBecause we always aim to map the entire police or military, our research can help make connections between what human rights groups have documented and the wider chain of command.\u201d\nHe said the project relied on open-source information drawn from the work of national and international human rights organizations and local activists, as well as books, independent newspapers and the military\u2019s own media outlets.\nIts previous work includes research on the Mexican Army\u2019s chain of command for a complaint to the International Criminal Court alleging crimes against humanity. Its methodology has been used to support the Syrian Archive\u2019s submission of evidence to investigative and prosecute authorities in Germany, France, and Sweden about the 2013 sarin gas attack on Khan Shaykhun.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve applied lessons learned from researching militaries around the world to our work in Myanmar, and we would not have been able to map the Myanmar Army without those lessons,\u201d said Wilson.",

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - African countries are less likely to follow East Asia's development model of expanding manufacturing to pull people out of poverty, according to a study that shows a declining share of factory jobs for most countries by mid-century.\nThe new paper released on Monday by the Center for Global Development shows there will be fewer factory workers in 2050 globally than there are now, and that even in poor countries with abundant cheap labor, manufacturing job growth will stagnate.\nChina may be an exception, further expanding its share of manufacturing output among 59 countries modeled in the study to 43.8% in 2050 from 30% in 2018 and 10.5% in 1975.\nThe study's authors say that China will continue to dominate global manufacturing, moving into higher-value segments.\nWhile this may create some space for other developing countries in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America to move into lower-end manufacturing in low-end sectors abandoned by China, it won't be enough to replicate the transformative East Asian development model of moving from Agriculture to manufacturing.\nInstead, CGD senior fellows Charles Kenny and Ranil Dissanayake say that many countries will move straight from agriculture to services, where jobs will expand rapidly, especially because of new technologies -- even in countries such as Bangladesh and Ethiopia.\n\"There\u2019s still a popular idea that low-income countries will progress naturally from being dominated by agriculture to manufacturing-led growth, but mounting evidence suggests that\u2019s not going to happen,\" said Kenny. \"We think that farms are going to empty out across Africa and Asia in the coming decades, but people are likely to flood into offices and shops, not factories.\"\nThe study projects global growth through the year 2050 and models changes in the economies of 59 countries accounting for about three quarters of the world\u2019s GDP and population.\nIt projects that even for the lowest-income countries, the number of factory jobs will barely keep pace with population growth over the next 30 years, and manufacturing is likely to remain a small part of most of these countries\u2019 economies.\nAcross all low-income countries, manufacturing jobs are projected to hold steady at below 8% of total employment, the study finds. It projects the share of manufacturing jobs in high-income countries will continue to fall, to 8.3% by 2050 from 11.4% currently.\nIt said that private service sector jobs will make up roughly 37% of global jobs by 2050, and 26% in today\u2019s low-income countries, up from about 12% currently.

In our view the bid offer for first cuts is June to Q3 next year,\" he said.\nElsewhere, the Japanese yen flattened at 149.58, after strengthening following data that showed Japan's core consumer price growth picked up slightly in October, having eased the previous month.\nThat reinforced investors' views that stubborn inflation may push the BOJ to roll back monetary stimulus before long.\nThe Asian currency has slowly crawled away from the near 33-year low of 151.92 it touched at the start of last week and is up 1.5% for the month.\nING economists said they expect the BOJ to move away from its super-accommodative stance next year.\n\"We believe that the BOJ may scrap the yield curve programme as early as the first quarter of next (year), as Japanese government bonds appear to have stabilised,\" they said.\nThe bank will \"then begin its first rate hike in Q2 2024 if wage growth continues to accelerate next year\".\nThe nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.9% year-on-year in October, government data showed on Friday, against 3.0% expected by economists in a Reuters poll.\nJapan's factory activity shrank for a sixth straight month in November, while modest growth in the service sector was little changed, a business survey showed on Friday, highlighting the fragility of the economy amid soft demand and inflation.\nThe euro edged 0.05% higher to $1.0911, after data confirmed an initial estimate published in late October that showed Germany's economy shrank slightly in the third quarter compared with the previous three months.\nThe single currency is pausing for breath after gaining some ground on Thursday after a series of preliminary surveys showed recession in Germany may be shallower than expected, which offset a downbeat reading on French business activity.\nSterling flattened at $1.2541.\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore and Joice Alves in London; Editing by Jan Harvey)",

        "text": "\nBy Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed in October in part as strikes by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union against Detroit's \"Big Three\" car makers depressed manufacturing payrolls, and the increase in annual wages was the smallest in nearly 2-1/2 years, pointing to an easing in labor market conditions.\nThe Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate rising to 3.9% last month, the highest level since January 2022, from 3.8 in September.\nThe economy added 101,000 fewer jobs in August and September than previously estimated, also suggesting slowing labor market momentum. The report strengthened financial market expectations that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates for the current cycle, and improved the chances of the U.S. central bank engineering a \"soft-landing\" for the economy rather than plunging it into recession as some economists had feared.\n\"This is a very Fed-friendly report,\" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. \"The only wrinkle is that the labor force shrank. Still, the overall softness in the report will go a long way to keeping the Fed on the sidelines for a third straight meeting in December.\"\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 jobs last month after rising by 297,000 in September, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 180,000.\nAbout 52.0% of private sector industries reported increases in employment, the lowest since April 2020, compared to 61.4% in September, the survey of establishments showed.\nManufacturing employment dropped 35,000, with the UAW strike at Ford Motor, General Motors and Chrysler parent Stellantis factories as well as at Mack Trucks plants subtracting 33,000 jobs.\nIn addition to the industrial action, which has since ended, the slowdown in employment gains last month was pay-back after September's gains, which were the largest in eight months.\nThough hiring is slowing as a result of the cumulative impact of rate hikes from the Fed, payroll gains remain way above the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\n\"A payroll increase of 150,000 is not bad, and 180,000 - what it would have been without the strike and ancillary impacts - is solid,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. \"So, no need to worry about excessive weakness at least until we see what the post-strike environment looks like.\"\nLast month's increase in hiring was led by the healthcare sector, which added 58,000 jobs, the bulk of them in ambulatory health care services. Employment in government increased by 51,000 positions, returning to its pre-pandemic level. The rise in government payrolls was driven by local government hiring.\nThe construction industry added 23,000 jobs. There were also gains in social assistance as well as professional and business services payrolls, with temporary help jobs - a harbinger of future hiring - rebounding after eight straight monthly declines. Leisure and hospitality employment rose 19,000, well below the monthly average of 52,000 in the last 12 months.\nThe transportation and warehousing industry suffered job losses as did the information industry, continuing to be weighed down by an ongoing strike in Hollywood.\nFinancial markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to keep rates unchanged in December and January, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. Stocks on Wall Street rallied. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note hitting a five-week low.\nWAGE GROWTH COOLS\nThe U.S. central bank held rates unchanged on Wednesday but left the door open to a further rise in borrowing costs in a nod to the economy's resilience. Since March 2022, it has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% band.\nAverage hourly earnings rose 0.2% in October after climbing 0.3% in September. In the 12 months through October, wages increased 4.1%, the smallest increase since June 2021, after rising 4.3% in September. The average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.4 hours. Aggregate hours worked fell 0.3%. Both reflected the impact of the auto strikes on the economy.\nThe labor market is the major force behind the economy's staying power, with gross domestic product recording an annualized growth pace of nearly 5% in the third quarter.\nThough wage pressures are easing because of a recent expansion of the labor pool and fewer people changing jobs, the annual growth in average hourly earnings remains above the 3.5% that economists say is consistent with the Fed's 2% target.\n\"We'll see a significant deceleration in growth in the fourth quarter, but not in a way that we're plunging into any kind of recession,\" said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Forecasting.\nEconomists were split on the impact of record-breaking labor contracts, including the ones scored by the UAW, airline pilots and the union representing UPS workers, on wage inflation.\nSome argued that the recent surge in worker productivity, if maintained, would be enough to offset the higher compensation. Others pointed out that the U.S. economy was now predominantly based on services, which would make it harder to boost productivity.\nEbbing labor market momentum was also evident in the smaller household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived. Household employment fell 348,000, accounting for the rise in the jobless rate. The strike also impacted the unemployment rate. About 201,000 people dropped out of the labor force.\nThat lowered the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, to 62.7% from 62.8% in September.\nThe prime-age group participation rate declined, mostly because of men dropping out of the labor force.\nThe ranks of Americans experiencing long-term unemployment increased 66,000 to 1.282 million. The number of people working part-time for economic reasons rose 218,000 to 4.283 million. There was also an increase in people working multiple jobs.\n\"October's employment report, in conjunction with the third-quarter report on productivity and costs, clearly indicates that the economy has converged already to potentially a more sustainable path of low inflation and solid potential growth,\" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Paul Simao)",

        "text": "\nCitibank systematically discriminated against Armenian Americans for six years, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wednesday, and now has to pay $25.9 million in fines and consumer redress.\nThe government watchdog said that from 2015 to 2021, Citi \u201ctreated Armenian Americans as criminals who were likely to commit fraud.\u201d Citi managers trained and directed employees to target retail services credit card applicants based on their surnames and area of residence. Those living in or around Glendale, Calif., which is home to 15% of Armenian Americans in the US, were singled out for rejection.\nThe actions are a violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the CFPB noted, as applicants were denied services based on their nationality. Now, the nation\u2019s third-largest bank has to pay $1.4 million to harmed consumers \u2014 along with a $24.5 million fine to the CFPB\u2019s victims relief fund.\n\u201cArmenian-Americans commonly have last names with certain endings. Citi developed a scheme where the company would flag applicants with these last names,\u201d CFPB director Rohit Chopra, said in a statement. \u201cCiti also used applicants\u2019 place of residence to guess national origin.\u201d\nChopra added: \u201cCiti often rejected these applicants outright. When Citi did not, the bank subjected those who may be of Armenian descent to additional scrutiny. The internal message to Citi employees was clear: root out Armenian-American applicants.\u201d\nIn response to the announcement on Wednesday, Citigroup issued an apology, indicating that a small group of employees took \u201cimpermissible actions\u201d in an attempt to thwart fraud surrounding a \u201cwell-documented Armenian fraud ring operating in parts of California.\u201d\n\u201cWe sincerely apologize to any applicant who was evaluated unfairly by the small number of employees who circumvented our fraud detection protocols,\u201d Citigroup said in a statement provided to the press. \u201cFollowing an internal investigation, we have taken appropriate actions with those directly involved in this matter and we promptly put in place measures to prevent any recurrence of such conduct.\u201d\nThe court order said the practice of discrimination affected credit card applicants, including those seeking a new credit card or a credit line increase on an existing card because these were \u201csubject to manual underwriting\u201d by certain employees from Citi\u2019s retail services unit.\nCourt documents said any employees or agents who have the authority to approve or deny a credit card, those who assist or supervise those employees or agents, and those involved in risk detection, compliance, or fraud prevention related to credit cards were under review.\nAccording to the court order, some Citi employees referred to these applicants as \u201cArmenian bad guys\u201d or the \u201cSouthern California Armenian Mafia.\u201d\nThe CFPB noted that Citi employees purposefully barred applicants with a last name ending in -ian or -yan and addresses known to have a high concentration of Armenian Americans. These disparities in underwriting were \u201chighly unlikely to have occurred by chance.\u201d\nThe CFPB also said that Citi supervisors \u201cconspired to hide the discrimination\u201d by instructing employees to avoid discussing discriminatory practices in writing or on recorded phone lines. Citi employees also lied to denied applicants about their basis of denial.\n\u201cAt one point, a Citi employee explained it had been a while since they had denied an application because of a consumer\u2019s Armenian surname, and wanted a suggestion on how to cover up the discrimination,\u201d the CFPB said. \u201cThe response was to decline the credit card application due to suspected credit abuse, which essentially blamed the applicant for the denial.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s action makes clear that banks and other lenders, regardless of their size or political clout, cannot deny an individual\u2019s application for credit merely based on their name and perceived national origin,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cThe CFPB\u2019s case against Citi shows that each person who applies for credit is entitled to fair, non-discriminatory consideration of their application.\u201d\nGabriella is a personal finance and housing reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\nBy Phil Stewart\nTOKYO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. military's top general expressed optimism on Friday for a potential improvement in military-to-military ties with China and sent an introductory letter to his Chinese counterpart saying he was open to meeting.\nAir Force General Charles Q. Brown, who took over as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff just over a month ago, also said he did not believe that Chinese President Xi Jinping necessarily wanted to take Taiwan by force, while not ruling out the possibility.\nThe remarks by Brown during a trip to Japan came ahead of expected talks next week between Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden as they seek to stabilise tense relations.\nPentagon officials say a restoration of military ties, largely severed by Beijing, is crucial to preventing a miscalculation from spiralling into conflict.\n\"I think there's an opportunity and ... as the President potentially meets with Xi next week, we're getting indications that there is some interest,\" Brown told a small group of reporters in Tokyo. \"If the opportunity presents itself, I will definitely engage.\"\nBrown did not specify to whom he sent the introductory letter. But China's General Liu Zhenli is the Chief of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the military body responsible for China's combat operations and planning.\nBrown said he sent a standard introductory letter that explained, \"I'm in the position and willing to open a line of communication.\"\nU.S. officials have cautioned that even with some restoration of military communications, forging truly functional dialogue between the two sides could take time.\nSome analysts say China seeks ambiguity in defence relations to constrain what Beijing sees as U.S. military provocations in the region.\nTAIWAN\nWashington and Beijing are at loggerheads over everything from the future of democratically ruled Taiwan to territorial claims in the South China Sea. Diplomatic relations are still recovering after the U.S. downed an alleged Chinese spy balloon in February.\nBrown appeared to downplay Xi's enthusiasm for a potential invasion of Taiwan, in part given the military difficulty of such an operation. CIA Director William Burns has said Xi has instructed his country's armed forces to be ready to invade by 2027.\n\"I do think that Xi Jinping doesn't necessarily want to take Taiwan by force. He will try to use other ways to do this,\" Brown told a small group of reporters in Tokyo. \"I also believe that taking Taiwan by force and doing a major amphibious operation is not an easy feat.\"\nBrown, a former commander of the U.S. Air Force in the Asia-Pacific region, has met People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials in the past, including the People's Liberation Army Air Force's northern theatre commander in 2019 during a visit to Seoul.\nLiu has emerged as the top contender to replace China's country's defence minister, General Li Shangfu, who was dismissed from his position last month. Reuters reported in September that Li was under investigation over suspected corruption related to equipment procurement and development.\nBrown acknowledged corruption in the Chinese military when asked about Li's removal, and broader issues in the PLA, but also noted \"alignment with Xi Jinping and his thinking as he continues to consolidate power\".\nLi was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018 for an arms deal he secured with Russia in an earlier role. China had demanded the sanctions - which include a visa ban and prohibitions on conducting U.S. financial transactions - be lifted.\nLiu, 59, is not under Western sanctions.\nAny decision to improve military-to-military ties - frozen by Beijing when then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August 2022 - would be made by Xi, who has the ultimate say in all important policies and appointments.\nXi is also commander in chief of the armed forces and chairman of the CMC, China's top defence decision-making body, on which Liu already sits.

It had a more than a 12,600-vote margin at Ford and a 9,600-vote lead at Stellantis with just a few small locals' results yet to vote or be reported.\nThe votes locks in the UAW's tentative agreement with the Detroit Three automakers through April 2028, which includes a 25% increase in base wages and will cumulatively raise the top wage by 33%, compounded with estimated cost-of-living adjustments to over $42 an hour.\nWorkers on Thursday at General Motors voted to approve the deal, with about 55% of nearly 36,000 members in favor.\nStellantis, Ford and the UAW did not comment.\nThe deal includes a $5,000 bonus and an 11% immediate pay hike upon ratification. The contract also hikes wages of current temporary workers by 150% by 2028 and will make them permanent employees.\nThe agreement also cuts the time needed to get to top pay from eight years to three years.\nThe new contract follows an unprecedented six-week campaign of coordinated strikes at the Detroit Three automakers.\nUltimately, the union was able to clinch record pay hikes for auto workers after years of stagnant wages and painful concessions following the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe UAW now plans to turn its focus to organizing non-union auto factories operated by foreign automakers and Tesla .\nWhen President Joe Biden, a Democrat, visited Illinois last week, he backed the UAW's efforts to unionize Tesla and Toyota , adding that all U.S. auto workers deserve a deal similar to the UAW's recent agreements with the Detroit Three.\nHyundai Motor, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor have all announced significant wage hikes for U.S. factory workers after the UAW contract deals were announced.\nAutomakers are looking to trim costs as they make the shift to electric vehicles and face higher hourly labor costs. Ford has estimated the new contract will add $850 to $900 in labor costs per vehicle.\nStellantis said Monday it was offering 6,400 U.S. salaried employees voluntary buyouts. The buyouts offered are to about half the company's salaried U.S. employees not represented by a union, which is currently 12,700. Another 2,500 Stellantis U.S. salaried workers are unionized and are not being offered the current buyout.

He is due to meet Biden at an undisclosed location in the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday morning and then attend the annual summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.\nXi's summit with Biden will be the firstface-to-face meeting between the U.S. and Chinese leaders in a year and has been billed by U.S. officials as an opportunity to reduce friction in what many see as the world's most dangerous rivalry.\nXi waved from the steps of his Air China plane upon arrival and descended to meet U.S. officials on the tarmac, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.\nHe then got into his Chinese Hongqi, or \"Red Flag,\" limousine and departed the airport into San Francisco, where demonstrations are expected both for and against his visit.\nLess than two hours earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed ministers of the 21-member APEC and stressed the U.S. believed in \"a region where economies are free to choose their own path ... where goods, ideas, people flow lawfully and freely.\"\nBlinken did not mention China by name, but his language echoed U.S. rhetoric in recent years in which Washington has accused China of bullying smaller countries in the Indo-Pacific and trying to undermine what the U.S. and its allies call the \"rules-based\" order.\nU.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, who with Blinken opened the APEC ministerial session, said the San Francisco meeting came at a time of \"great uncertainty and challenges\" for the region. She noted increasing geopolitical tensions, fragile supply chains and a worsening climate crisis.\nEarlier, Biden said he aimed to improve the relationship with China after a period of strained ties and would seek to resume normal communications between the two superpowers, including military-to-military contacts.\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that Biden and Xi would also talk about the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza as well as U.S. efforts to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian military.\nEconomic issues will be high on the agenda.\nBiden said the U.S. does not want to decouple from China, but wants to change the economic relationship for the better. His administration has made a push to \"de-risk\" some critical U.S. supply chains from China as the two countries\u2019 economic and military competition has grown.\nXi, who is seeking to entice foreign investment during the APEC to counter his country's recent struggles, is expected to dine with top U.S. business executives on Wednesday.\nFor American businesses, it will be a chance to hear directly from China's leader as they search for ways to navigate that country's economic slowdown and uncertainty caused by expanding Chinese security rules.\nCONCERNS ABOUT A SHOWDOWN\nBiden has been careful to assure countries in the region, including China, that the U.S. does not seek complete economic separation, a notion that has fueled concerns among Washington's partners and allies of a superpower showdown that would upend the global economy.\nChina severed military-to-military contacts with the U.S. after then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited democratically governed but Chinese-claimed Taiwan in August 2022.\nRestoring the contacts is a top U.S. goal to avoid miscalculations between the two militaries.\nWashington also hopes for more cooperation from Beijing in combating production of the potent synthetic opioid drug fentanyl, which has become a scourge in the United States and particularly in San Francisco.\nSino-U.S. relations worsened after Biden ordered the shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over the United States.\nTop Biden administration officials have since visited Beijing and met with their counterparts in an effort to rebuild communications and trust.\nSeveral hundred mostly pro-China demonstrators carrying Chinese flags gathered outside the Chinese delegation's hotel ahead of Xi's arrival in the U.S.\nLarger protests, including by rights groups critical of Xi's policies in Tibet, Hong Kong and toward Muslim Uyghurs, are expected near the summit venue on Wednesday.\nAs Biden arrived in San Francisco, shortly before Xi was due to land, dueling demonstrators greeted the U.S. president's motorcade from the airport. Some waved Chinese flags and held banners calling for \"kindly\" and \"warm\" U.S.-Sino ties. Others held signs condemning the Chinese Communist Party.\nEarlier on Tuesday, a small aircraft flew circles over the APEC summit venue in downtown San Francisco, trailing a banner that read, \"END CCP FREE CHINA FREE HK FREE TIBET FREE UIGHUR,\" referring to China's treatment of Uyghurs, which the Biden administration calls \"genocide.\" (Reporting by Michael Martina, Ann Saphir, David Brunnstrom, Trevor Hunnicutt, David Lawder, Sayantani Ghosh and Peter Henderson; Editing by Leslie Adler, Chris Reese, Josie Kao, Don Durfee and Lincoln Feast.)",

Singapore ordered the firm to stop doing business in the city state. Hong Kong warned more than two years ago that Binance was an unregulated platform. Even Dubai, where CZ primarily resides, has yet to grant the exchange full authorization.\nRead: Binance\u2019s Lead in Offshore Markets Falls as Rivals Gain Ground\nBut beyond the embattled exchange business, another corner of the broad CZ-owned portfolio of crypto companies said it\u2019s seeing growth in countries like India and Pakistan \u2014 based on third-party data on downloads \u2014 as well as business opportunities in the UAE.\nTrust Wallet is a software-based crypto wallet service designed to let users self-custody the kinds of digital assets popular in decentralized finance applications. CZ acquired a majority stake in the company that operates Trust Wallet in 2018. Its current CEO since 2022, Eowyn Chen, was previously a vice president of marketing at Binance.\n\u201cI do want to make Asia a high priority for growth,\u201d Chen, who is 33, told Bloomberg News in an interview on the sidelines of a crypto conference in Australia last month.\nChen identified Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia as markets to expand for the platform. \u201cI would imagine the average revenue per user in those places will be lower, but the collective amount could potentially also be very interesting,\u201d she said.\nGlobally, the app-based service has 56 million downloads on iOS and Android, making it the most popular crypto wallet for handheld devices, according to Data.ai. Rival MetaMask is second, with 43 million such downloads. In India, Trust Wallet saw about 8.5 million downloads and in Pakistan some 3.5 million, followed by MetaMask, according to Data.ai.\nDespite the perceived growth potential in Asia, it is to the United Arab Emirates that the company is shifting its operations.\nChen herself moved to Dubai from Virginia in October, while the company will be based in Ras Al Khaimah, the sixth-largest city in the UAE. The company has about 80 employees worldwide with about 15%-20% in the UAE, Chen said.\nRead: The Emirate Pitching Itself as the Next Haven for Billionaires\n\u201cThe regulatory uncertainty in the US is a challenge,\u201d Chen said. \u201cSo we are also diversifying our risk management from a corporate perspective by setting up the UAE entity.\u201d\nChen described regulators in the UAE as having a \u201cfriendlier outlook toward crypto in general\u201d. That gives Trust Wallet confidence about the likelihood of \u201creasonable regulation on decentralized finance,\u201d Chen said.\nChen said Trust Wallet operates from the free trade zone of Ras Al Khaimah, where it has a business license. The zone is also known as RAK DAO, for \u201cDigital Asset Oasis,\u201d and caters primarily to blockchain companies.\nRAK has \u201cmore flexible and better corporate treatment\u201d for web3 companies, she said in explaining the reasons for basing operations there. Officials at RAK DAO declined to comment.\nA separate company, DApps Platform, holds the intellectual property rights for the wallet service and is based in Abu Dhabi Global Market, another free trade zone in the UAE, Chen said.\nTrust Wallet is not profitable yet, Chen said, and only started generating revenue in the last year.\nCZ and Trust Wallet\nWhile CZ doesn\u2019t have any role in Trust Wallet\u2019s day-to-day operations, he provides \u201coperational strategic advice\u201d as the majority owner of the entity. CZ \u201cbrings a lot of spotlight and exposure\u201d when he talks about Trust Wallet, Chen said.\nTrust Wallet\u2019s native token TWT jumped about 50% to $2.48 in a single day last November, after CZ promoted the app on X in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX crypto exchange. It was trading at about $1.11 as of 2:15 p.m. on Friday in Singapore, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much marketing budget. We probably only spend about a few thousand dollars per month on marketing,\u201d Chen said. \u201cA lot of our growth happened organically or with word-of-mouth promotions,\u201d she said.\nCZ\u2019s settlement with US prosecutors saw him resign as CEO of Binance, where he was replaced by Richard Teng. CZ additionally relinquished his role as chairman of Binance\u2019s US exchange while retaining an economic interest in that beleaguered platform.\nBinance recently launched a similar, branded crypto wallet that appears to compete directly with the Trust Wallet platform \u2014 and it remains to be seen whether Teng will seek to expand the Binance product aggressively.\nRead: New Binance CEO Teng\u2019s First Job Is to Avert Customer Exodus (3)\n--With assistance from Ben Bartenstein.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAnduril Builds a Tiny, Reusable Fighter Jet That Blows Up Drones\nB-School Admissions Deans Are Feeling The Pressure From Falling Applications\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

We\u2019ve reflected the latest trends and advertiser reaction that we\u2019ve seen into our Q4 outlook, which again, I think reflects the greater uncertainty and volatility ahead.\"\nThe company's shares initially rose as much as 4% in after-hours trading, but erased those gains in the aftermath of Meta's call and were over 3% lower in Thursday's pre-market.\nMeta's been navigating rough waters, steadying itself as an AI-powered advertising giant and working through its capital-intensive expansion into VR and AR. The Facebook and Instagram parent has been in the process of shoring up two key areas of interest for investors \u2014 its AI efforts and its position in the digital advertising market, which has been in a prolonged slump and is just showing signs of a rebound.\nMeta's Q3 advertising revenue came in at $33.64 billion, compared to the expected $32.94 billion. The company beat on ad impressions estimates, clocking an increase of 31% year over year, versus the expected 29.6%.\nMeta shares have risen more than 130% year to date, massively outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Internet Index, which are up around 9% and 34% this year, respectively.\n\"The stock has done well this year,\" Neuberger Bergman analyst Daniel Flax told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. \"[If they can] drive durable growth and translate that into earnings per share and free cash flow generation, I think the stock can continue to work its way higher.\"\nMeta's near future could be mired in legal risks, as the company is staring down federal and state lawsuits from 42 attorneys general, who are alleging that Facebook and Instagram's features geared toward children are addictive.\n\"We\u2019re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.\nCurrently, Wall Street analysts' recommendations for Meta break down to 60 Buys, seven Holds, and two Sells.\nHere are the key numbers that Meta reported, as compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\nRevenue: $34.15 billion actual, up 23% year-over-year, versus $33.52 billion expected\nEarnings per share: $4.39 actual, up 168% year-over-year, versus $3.60 expected\nFacebook daily active users: 2.09 billion actual, versus 2.07 billion expected\nReality Labs operating loss: $3.74 billion actual, versus $3.94 billion expected\nQ4 revenue outlook: $36.5 billion-$40 billion actual, versus $38.76 billion expected\nZuckerberg's \"Year of Efficiency\" initiatives seem to be paying off, as the company is decreasing its 2023 capital expenditures outlook. It's revising the range to be between $27 billion and $29 billion, a decline from the previously announced $27 billion to $30 billion.\nMeta's Family of Apps business, which also includes WhatsApp, raked in over $33 billion in revenue. The division's operating income was $17.49 billion for the quarter, handily beating analysts' expectation of $15.23 billion.\nBut Reality Labs, the company's mixed reality business, has been a subject of controversy. Since 2022, Meta has lost more than $20 billion running Reality Labs; $13.7 billion of that came from last year.\nThe company said it expects these losses to continue, and will increase notably year over year in 2023. Meta recently launched its Quest 3 headset, priced at $499.99.\n\"We had a good quarter for our community and business,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. \"I'm proud of the work our teams have done to advance AI and mixed reality with the launch of Quest 3, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and our AI studio.\"\nAllie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

But as the potential fallout of business-halting cyberattacks becomes too big to insure, issuers are seizing the moment.\nBeazley Plc, which owns specialist insurers across Europe and the US, is exploring a potential $100 million cyber cat bond, according to Artemis, a research firm specializing in insurance-linked securities. And Axis Capital is preparing to issue a $75 million cyber catastrophe bond, according to a preliminary offer document seen by Bloomberg.\nSpokespeople for Axis Capital and Beazley declined to comment on the deals.\nThe wider market for cat bonds is likely to reach a record $40 billion this year. A lot of that growth has been fueled by the impact of climate change, as extreme weather shocks threaten to make insurers\u2019 business models untenable. For that reason, some of the most active players in the cat bond market are reinsurers such as Swiss Re AG and Munich Re AG.\nInvestors have been drawn to returns that trounce those of US Treasuries. This year, the Swiss Re Global Cat Bond Performance Index is up 18%, while the Bloomberg US Treasury Index has dropped about 1%.\nIssuers of cyber cat bonds want to protect themselves from financial losses that can follow a major cyberattack, including lost revenue, legal fees and regulatory fines.\nRead More: ICBC Hit by Cyberattack, Tells Clients to Reroute Trades\nInsurance-linked securities \u201coffer corporate boards and business owners a degree of comfort over their balance sheet resilience in the event of a larger cyber event,\u201d according to a recent report co-authored by Kathleen Faries, chief executive officer of Artex Capital Solutions.\nBut with limited historical data to analyze, as well as increasingly sophisticated forms of cyber crime, investors face unusually high levels of risk.\n\u201cWith hurricanes we have decades of data,\u201d said Marco della Giacoma, portfolio manager at Tenax Capital, a London-based hedge fund that regularly invests in cat bonds. \u201cBut it\u2019s more difficult to price cyber risk.\u201d\nToby Pughe, an analyst at Tenax, says it\u2019s hard to trust a cyber model. \u201cIf they say the loss estimate is 1%, it could actually be 5% or 6%,\u201d he said.\nOther investors said they welcome the opportunity to get more exposure to the market for insurance-linked securities.\n\u201cWe are now seeing leading cyber underwriters positioning themselves to tap the ILS market with transparent deal structures that target catastrophe\u2014rather than attritional\u2014risk, in a form and at pricing levels that we believe have become attractive,\u201d said Joanna Syroka, director of new markets at Fermat Capital Management, one of the biggest cat bond investors.\nFermat \u201cwill consider all deals as they are announced,\u201d she said. \u201cCyber could be the fastest growing line of ILS, in line with the growth rate of the underlying cyber insurance market, due to the relative lack of internal diversification within the peril.\u201d\nPaul Bantick, global head of cyber risks at Beazley, said the threat of cyber losses is now such that \u201ctraditional reinsurance can\u2019t get you there.\u201d Though he declined to comment on specific deals, Bantick said the message from investors is \u201cthe time is now\u201d for cat bonds to fill the reinsurance gap.\nThere has been a handful of cyber cat bonds issued so far, including three privately placed by Beazley. The new securities expected from Axis and Beazley are notable because they will likely trade on secondary markets, providing access to a much wider pool of hedge funds, pensions and other investors.\nHannover Re, which underwrote about \u20ac800 million ($856 million) of premiums for cybersecurity last year, is also exploring the new market.\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly confident we\u2019ll use cat bonds to transfer cyber risk to the capital markets,\u201d said Henning Ludolphs, a managing director at the German reinsurer. \u201cThis could be sooner rather than later, maybe even within the next couple of months.\u201d\nThe list of known cyberattacks is long and growing. In 2017, suspected Russian malware shut down Ukrainian banks, government agencies, drugmaker Merck & Co. and shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, an event that cost $10 billion in losses, according to the White House. In 2021, an attack on the computer network of Colonial Pipeline disrupted US oil supplies.\nLast year, the number of ransomware attacks against industrial firms alone surged 87%, cybersecurity firm Dragos Inc. estimates. Earlier this month, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. was hit by a cyberattack that prevented it from clearing swathes of trades. The incident forced clients of the world\u2019s largest lender by assets to reroute transactions, leaving brokers and traders scrambling to assess the extent of the impact.\nAnd DP World Plc has been struggling to work through a backlog of 30,000 shipping containers piled up at ports across Australia as the company resumes operations following a cyberattack on Friday.\nRead More: Cyberattack Keeps Australian Ports Offline as Containers Pile Up\nIn the US, losses stemming from cyber crime soared 48% to $10.2 billion last year from 2021, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And a recent PwC survey of CEOs found that a quarter consider their companies to be highly or extremely exposed to cyber risk over the next five years. They outnumber the 22% who voiced similar concerns about the threat of climate change.\nThe perceived risks are reflected in costs. Munich Re estimates the premiums that corporations will have to pay to insure themselves against cyberattacks are set to almost triple to $33 billion between 2022 and 2027.\n\u201cCyber risk is one of Munich Re\u2019s main strategic growth areas,\u201d said Chris Storer, head of the reinsurer\u2019s cyber center of excellence.\nTheo Norris, head of cyber insurance-linked securities at Gallagher Securities, said \u201cthere are enough ILS investors to make a dent in the capital needs of the cyber insurance market.\u201d\nFor Gallagher Securities, which structured and placed Beazley\u2019s private cyber cat bonds, the goal is to \u201ccontinue building on this to attract even more ILS investment to support our clients and ultimately make cyber insurance more available and affordable,\u201d he said.\n(Adds details of weekend cyberattack on Australian ports.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nA German Startup Races Google to Develop a Universal Translator\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

        "text": "\n(Recasts, adds details and background throughout)\nBy Michael S. Derby\nNEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) -\nThe Cleveland Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it has begun to search for a replacement for its current president, Loretta Mester, a veteran central banker who has led the regional bank since 2014.\nMester is scheduled to retire on June 30, 2024 due to Fed rules that limit officials' service based on age and length of service. Over her tenure, she has been one of the U.S. central bank's more hawkish voices and has at times favored a tighter monetary policy stance than her colleagues.\nThe search process will be overseen by members of the Cleveland Fed's Board of Directors who do not come from firms the central bank regulates.\nThe process will be led by Heidi Gartland, the chief government and community relations officer with University Hospitals and the deputy chair of the Cleveland Fed's board. The U.S. central bank must approve the Cleveland Fed's choice.\nThe 12 regional Fed banks are quasi-private institutions that are technically owned by local banks, although they operate under the control of the Fed's Board of Governors in Washington. Their respective boards are drawn from the private sector.\nIn a press release announcing the start of the search, Gartland said, \"Mester's strong leadership over the past decade has positioned the Cleveland Fed as an important resource to the community and the nation.\"\nGartland added that \"thanks in no small part to her intellect, energy, and dedication to public service, the Cleveland Fed today is known around the globe for its top-quality economic research, financial institution supervision, community development outreach, and delivery of financial services.\"\nLEADERSHIP FLUX\nSearches for regional Fed banks have become contentious in recent years due to the opacity of the process. Whereas Fed officials in Washington are selected by the U.S. president and confirmed by the Senate in a public process, regional Fed leaders are chosen behind closed doors and the public rarely knows who is in contention for a position that helps set the nation's monetary policy and regulates local financial institutions.\nIn the last few years, regional Fed leadership has been in flux.\nTwo officials left early\nin September 2021 amid questions about their investment activities, while the Kansas City Fed dealt\nwith an extended search\nfor new leadership even as its own former leader, Esther George, had faced mandatory retirement. Also, the St. Louis Fed is still searching for a new boss after its former chief, James Bullard,\nabruptly quit over the summer\nto take a position leading Purdue University's business school.\nFed banks have also been under increased pressure in recent years to diversify their leadership away from the white males drawn from business or finance who have typically dominated those positions. And to that end, a number of regional Fed banks have flagged diversity as a key consideration in their respective search processes.\nMester will exit the Fed after spending most of her professional life within the central bank. Before coming to the Cleveland Fed, Mester led the research department of the Philadelphia Fed.\nMester, according to data from Wrightson ICAP, dissented in 8% of her Federal Open Market Committee votes in favor of a tighter policy stance than preferred by other policymakers. Mester\nnotably voted against parts\nof the Fed's initial response to the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.\nRegional Fed leaders\nmust retire\nwhen they hit 65. If they join the central bank after the age of 55, they can be allowed to serve for 10 years, or until 75, whichever comes first. According to Brookings Institution data, the next regional Fed official who must exit due to age is Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in June 2025. (Reporting by Michael S.

I know it's not easy for many of them, but we don't want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire,\" Mark Regev, an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told MSNBC on Friday.\nSuch a move could compel hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled south from the Israeli assault on Gaza City to relocate again, along with residents of the southern city of Khan Younis, worsening a dire humanitarian crisis.\nKhan Younis has a population of more than 400,000.\nIsrael vowed to annihilate the Hamas militant group that controls the Gaza Strip following an Oct. 7 rampage into Israel in which its fighters killed 1,200 people and dragged 240 hostages into the enclave.\nSince then, Israel has bombed much of Gaza City to rubble, ordered the depopulation of the entire northern half of the enclave and left homeless around two-thirds of the strip's 2.3 million Palestinians.\nMany of those who have fled fear their displacement could become permanent.\nGaza health authorities raised their death toll on Friday to more than 12,000 people, 5,000 of them children. The United Nations deems those figures credible, though they are now updated infrequently due to the difficulty of collecting information.\nIsrael overnight Thursday dropped leaflets over eastern areas of Khan Younis telling people to evacuate to shelters, suggesting that military operations there are imminent.\nRegev said that Israeli Defence Forces will have to advance into the city to oust Hamas fighters from underground tunnels and bunkers, but that no such \"enormous infrastructure\" exists in less built-up areas to the west.\n\"I'm pretty sure that they won't have to move again\" if they move west, he continued. \"We're asking them to move to an area where hopefully there will be tents and a field hospital.\"\nBecause the western areas are closer to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, humanitarian aid could be brought in \"as quickly as possible,\" he said.\nFUEL DELIVERIES\nWith the war entering its seventh week, there was no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.\n\"We have prepared ourselves for a long and sustained defence from all directions. The more time the occupation's forces stay in Gaza, the heavier their continuous losses,\" Abu Ubaida, Hamas armed wing spokesman, said in a video statement.\nAmid warnings that its siege would cause starvation and disease, Israel on Friday appeared to bow to international pressure, agreeing to allow fuel trucks into Gaza and promising \"no limitation\" on aid requested by the United Nations.\nIsrael said it would allow two truckloads of fuel a day at the request of Washington to help the United Nations meet basic needs, and spoke of plans to increase aid more broadly.\n\"We will increase the capacity of the humanitarian convoys and trucks as long as there is a need,\" Colonel Elad Goren, from COGAT, the ministry of defence agency that coordinates administrative issues with the Palestinians, told a briefing.\nWhile Israel has promised to allow in aid in the past, the remarks appeared to signal a shift in tone after U.N. agencies warned that humanitarian conditions in Gaza were rapidly deteriorating, including a stark warning from the World Food Programme of the \"immediate possibility of starvation\".\nAt Gaza's biggest hospital, Al Shifa, Israel said its forces had found in two days of searching a vehicle with a large number of weapons and an underground structure it called a Hamas tunnel shaft.\nThe facility has been a primary target of Israel's ground assault and a focus of international alarm over the deepening humanitarian crisis.\nThe army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of the hospital, littered with concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.\nIsrael has long maintained that the hospital sat above a vast underground bunker housing a Hamas command headquarters. Hospital staff say this is false and that Israel's findings there have so far established no such thing.\nHamas denies using hospitals for military purposes. It says some hostages have received treatment at medical centres but they have not been held inside them.\nBABY, HOSTAGE DIE\nAl Shifa staff said a premature baby died at the hospital on Friday, the first baby to die there in the two days since Israeli forces entered. Three had died in the previous days while the hospital was surrounded.\nHamas also announced the death of a captive from Israel, an 85-year-old it said died of a panic attack during an air strike.\nIn Modiin, Israel, family held a funeral for Noa Marciano, 19, an Israeli army conscript whose body was recovered from Gaza City near Shifa hospital on Thursday. She had been abducted from a military base during the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught.\nThe military said it had also recovered the body of Yehudit Weiss, 65, a mother of five who was seized from Kibbutz Be\u2019eri.\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi, James Mackenzie Henriette Chacar and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Jonathan Landay; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

        "text": "\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 The billionaire Haslam family says in a lawsuit that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are trying to artificially depress the price the company is obligated to pay for the family's remaining 20% stake in the Pilot Travel Centers truck stop chain that Jim Haslam founded.\nBerkshire has paid nearly $11 billion since 2017 for the first 80% of Pilot.\nBerkshire changed the accounting practices at Pilot this year after it acquired control of the company. The lawsuit that was unsealed Thursday said that change is artificially depressing Pilot's reported earnings, which are used to set the purchase price Berkshire agreed to pay in 2017.\n\u201cBerkshire is intent on using the accounting change to justify grossly underpaying Pilot (the Haslam family) for its 20% interest,\" the lawsuit said.\nThe Haslam family, which includes Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, declined to comment beyond the lawsuit.\nThe redacted lawsuit didn't reveal how much the Haslam's believe they could lose because those figures were withheld from the document. But the family did say Berkshire estimated its stake would be worth $3.2 billion without the accounting change.\nBuffett didn't respond to questions about the dispute that were emailed to his assistant on Friday.\nPilot's Chief Legal Counsel Kristin Seabrook said in a prepared statement that this dispute isn't related to the operation of the nation's largest network of truck stops that has more than 850 locations and roughly 30,000 employees in the United States and Canada.\n\u201cThis legal dispute is limited to a narrow issue between owners and is in no way related to the management or day-to-day operations of Pilot Company,\" Seabrook said.\nBerkshire is known for largely letting its businesses run themselves and holding onto nearly every business it buys forever. The Haslams said their respect for Buffett and his conglomerate was a big part of why Berkshire was the only buyer they considered. In a somewhat unusual move, Berkshire installed a new CEO at Pilot after it took over this year and made the accounting change at the heart of this dispute.\nThe truck stops provided a meaningful boost to Berkshire's revenue and profits this year.\nBerkshire's decision to shift to something called \u201cpushdown accounting\u201d this year forced Pilot to take on higher depreciation and amortization costs and that resulted in lower net income, according to the lawsuit.\nThe Haslams tried unsuccessfully to argue at Pilot board meetings that the company shouldn't make that change or at least that the new accounting method shouldn't be used to determine the value of their stake, but they were outvoted by the five Berkshire members of the board.\nSo the elder Haslam appealed directly to Buffett, but the lawsuit says that all the revered investor would say is to reiterate that Berkshire will comply with the terms of the contract they all signed in 2017.\nAs part of that deal, Berkshire bought 38.6% of Pilot in 2017 for $2.758 billion before more than doubling that to 80% this year for an additional $8.2 billion. Buffett told Berkshire shareholders this spring that he wishes he could have bought the entire company at once because the price was better in 2017, but the Haslams wouldn't sell it all then.\n\u201cThe first stage we bought at what turned out to be a very attractive price,\" Buffett said at the meeting. \"The second stage turned out to be a very good year for the diesel business, which means that the seller got a very good price.\u201d\nThe Haslam's have the option once a year to decide whether they want to sell their remaining stake. The family asked the court to intervene and force Pilot to revert to the accounting method it used to use before they have to make that decision early next year.",

        "text": "\n(Updates with release of hostages)\nNov 25 (Reuters) - Hamas fighters released a first wave of 13 Israeli women and children on Friday under a truce deal and also released 11 farm workers from Thailand and the Philippines, after guns fell silent across the Gaza Strip for the first time in seven weeks.\nHere is what we know about the hostages.\nWHO ARE THE HOSTAGES?\nGunmen from Palestinian group Hamas took about 240 hostages and killed 1,200 people when they raided Israel on Oct. 7, according to the Israeli government. The hostages were from communities, including collective farms, called kibbutzim and military bases in southern Israel as well as people attending an outdoor music festival.\nIn addition to Israeli citizens, more than half the hostages held foreign and dual citizenship from some 40 countries including the U.S., Thailand, Britain, France, Argentina, Germany, Chile, Spain and Portugal, Israel's government has said.\nAccording to Israeli media and the Israeli government, up to 40 hostages were children, including a 10-month-old baby and pre-schoolers.\nAlso among those taken were soldiers, elderly people and people with disabilities.\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE HOSTAGES?\nHamas has to date released 28 hostages under the terms of a temporary truce deal. On Friday, 24 hostages were handed over at the Rafah border crossing - 13 Israelis, plus 10 Thais and a Filipino. The Israeli hostages included four children and their mothers, and five elderly women.\nBefore the deal was struck, Hamas had released four captives: U.S. citizens Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, 17, on Oct. 20, citing \"humanitarian reasons,\" and Israeli women Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, on Oct. 23.\nIsraeli forces freed one hostage, Ori Megidish, a soldier, in their ground invasion of Gaza on Oct. 30.\nThe Israeli military said earlier this month that it recovered the bodies of two hostages in Gaza City, including 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano.\nThe armed wing of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, which participated in the Oct. 7 raid with Hamas, announced late on Tuesday the death of another Israeli hostage but did not identify the individual.\nWHERE ARE THE HOSTAGES BEING HELD?\nHamas has said it has hidden the captives in \"safe places and tunnels\" in Gaza. Israel says the group has a vast underground network where it stores weapons, commands operations and uses tunnels to move its fighters.\nLifshitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was freed by Hamas, said that after she was seized, she was taken into underground tunnels that she compared to a spider web.\nThe Israeli military has said it found evidence that some hostages were held at or under hospitals.\nThe Israel Defence Forces said on Sunday that Marciano, the soldier whose body was recovered, was killed by Hamas within Al Shifa hospital. The military released video that it said also showed militants forcing two hostages into Shifa hospital on Oct. 7.\nWHAT HAVE CONDITIONS BEEN LIKE FOR HOSTAGES?\nLifshitz said her captors separated hostages into small groups. She said she and a few others with her slept on mattresses on the floor of the tunnels.

        "text": "\n(Corrects spelling to Samy from Sami in paragraph 6)\nBy Amanda Cooper\nLONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Global stocks steadied on Tuesday, underpinned by the conviction among investors that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates again, which kept the dollar at three-month lows and supported gold above $2,000 an ounce.\nTraders will have to weigh up data this week on how the U.S. economy fared in the third quarter, along with a key read of consumer inflation and spending - both of which could be instrumental in setting expectations for the timing of the first rate cut.\nThe MSCI All-World index was last unchanged on the day, still heading for its best month in three years, up 8.5% in November. The dollar, which has lost 3.2% in value against a basket of currencies this month, was also flat, around its lowest in three months.\nEuropean stocks fell 0.6%, driven by losses in pharma and consumer goods companies, while U.S. stock futures fell 0.1%.\nThe spotlight this week will be on Thursday's U.S. October personal consumption expenditures report (PCE), which includes core PCE, said to be the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, and euro zone consumer inflation figures - giving further clarity on where prices and monetary policy are headed.\nU.S. consumer inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), is running at a rate of 3.2%, having dropped from September's 3.7%, and core PCE, at 3.7% in September, is unlikely to buck that trend. What might give traders more pause for thought is the spending component of the PCE report, according to Lombard Odier economist Samy Chaar.\n\"That is important because, basically, the market is totally anchored in that 'soft landing' type scenario, where disinflation continues, with slow growth, allowing the Fed to cut four times next year starting March. That is a very complacent scenario,\" he said.\n\"Everything has to go great and in the Fed\u2019s direction for this scenario to actually materialise and play out. So the spending data is where we get some new information,\" he said.\nThe resilience of the U.S. consumer, thanks in part to a strong labour market, has helped the United States outperform most other developed economies in the past year.\nFutures markets show traders expect U.S. rates to stay where they are at 5.25-5.50%, with a small chance of a first cut by March and at least three subsequent cuts that would take rates closer to 4.25-4.5% by the end of 2024.\nGold traders will also keep a close eye on the U.S. inflation numbers. The price is at six-month highs above $2,000, driven by a weaker dollar and lower Treasury yields.\nPolicymakers at a number of central banks have reiterated their commitment to keeping interest rates high enough to bring down inflation towards their targets.\nEuro zone inflation data this week will keep that debate alive in European markets.\nNO LET-UP IN INFLATION FIGHT\nOn Monday, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the central bank's fight to contain price growth was not over, citing persistently strong wage growth and an uncertain outlook even as inflation pressures in euro zone ease.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell also speaks on Friday and traders will be watching to gauge where rates may head.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury yields, which have dropped by the most in a month since March in November, were up 2 basis points at 4.41%, surrendering some price gains after data on Monday showed new home sales fell more than expected in October as higher mortgage rates reduced affordability.\nShorter-dated yields were a touch higher, following auctions on Monday for over $100 billion in new supply of two- and five-year notes.\nIn currencies, the Japanese yen, which often tracks U.S. yields, strengthened, leaving the dollar 0.1% down at 148.44, while the euro was flat at $1.0956.\nWith the dollar trading a touch softer on the day, the oil price rose, with Brent crude up 1.1% at $80.83 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures rose 1.1% to $75.68.\nVolatility in the oil market has been stirred up this week by Thursday's meeting of the OPEC+ group of major exporters to discuss production targets.\n\"The Saudis and OPEC+ have made a habit of surprising markets in recent years when it comes to their meetings. However, with aggressive cuts already in place, it does leave one wondering the degree to which the group could surprise the market with deeper-than-expected cuts,\" ING strategist Warren Patterson said.\nMeanwhile, gold was up 0.1% at $2,014 an ounce.\n(Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee Editing by Sam Holmes, Kim Coghill,Ed Osmond and Frances Kerry)",

The index was up 0.4% for the week.\n\"This time of the month there are month-end flows that tend to predominate at certain points,\" Bipan Rai, North America head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets, said. \"I would expect some of that is reflected in the price action that we are seeing for the dollar today.\"\nFollowing big gains for the July-September period the dollar has struggled to make further advances despite relatively upbeat U.S. economic data, Rai noted.\n\"We have seen some signals, at least in the near term, that the dollar is a bit overbought,\" said Rai, who still expects the dollar to remain strong.\nForex moves were muted ahead of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan policy meetings next week.\n\"Additional positioning doesn't really make sense until those two key risk events are out of the way,\" Rai said.\nCooling inflation will likely keep the Fed on pause in coming months, traders bet on Friday, even as persistent underlying price pressures amid strong consumer spending kept some chance of a rate hike later this year in play.\nThe U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the third quarter, data on Thursday showed, as higher wages from a tight labour market helped power consumer spending.\nThe European Central Bank on Thursday left interest rates unchanged as expected, ending an unprecedented streak of 10 consecutive rate hikes.\nThe euro was\n0.12\n% higher at $\n1.0573\non Friday.\nData earlier this week showed euro zone business activity took a surprise turn for the worse this month.\nOverall risk sentiment improved a little on Friday with the Australian dollar, often used as a proxy for risk appetite, climbing\n0.25\n% to $\n0.6338\n, having slid to a one-year low of $0.6271 on Thursday.\nThe yen pulled back from 150 per dollar, a level some have seen as a potential trigger for intervention by Japanese authorities.\nDollar/yen was\n0.6\n% lower at\n149.515\n.\nJapan will continue to respond to the currency market \"with a strong sense of urgency,\" Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told reporters on Friday.\nThe BOJ meets next week and speculation is mounting that the central bank could change its policy on bond-yield control. An increase to an existing limit on yields set just three months ago has been discussed as a possibility.\n\"There is next to no expectation in the market that the BOJ will attempt to move away from its negative policy rate at its Oct. 31 meeting,\" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank, in a note.\n\"By contrast, the market is split on the prospects of another tweak to yield curve control.\"\nIn cryptocurrency markets, bitcoin slipped\n1.7\n% to $\n33,584\n. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap has advanced sharply in recent sessions, helped by speculation that an exchange-traded bitcoin fund is imminent.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper London, Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by David Holmes, Mike Harrison and Richard Chang)",

        "text": "\nBy Howard Schneider\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A recent surge in U.S. productivity has underscored Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's emerging narrative for how inflation may continue to decline even amidst sustained job and economic growth.\nThe best-of-both-worlds outcome would rely on the U.S. finding a new balance between the demand for and the supply of goods and services less by \"destroying\" demand - the way Fed interest rate increases typically play out - and more through improvements in the economy's capacity.\nIn what has been a somewhat unheralded surprise, that is what has been unfolding through both improvements in the number of people willing to work, including new immigrants, and also through improvements in how much each worker produces, a dynamic that lowers effective labor costs even if wages are higher.\nNew data released Wednesday showed productivity grew an outsized 4.7% in the third quarter, the largest increase in three years and the second large gain this year. That caused unit labor costs to fall at a 0.8% annualized rate.\nThe net result is higher potential output with less inflationary risk, something Powell pointed to on Wednesday in his most extensive comments to date on the possibility that for the moment at least the economy may have an enhanced ability to grow, add jobs, and raise wages without adding to inflation.\nThe October employment report due on Friday at 8:30 EDT (1230 GMT) will provide updated estimates of the size of the labor force, a critical piece of the puzzle. After stalling through much of 2022, the workforce grew by 3 million workers, or about 2%, in the nine months through September.\nThe dynamic is one reason why the Fed kept its policy interest rate on hold at 5.25%-5.50% at its meeting this week despite recent data showing the economy grew at a 4.9% annualized rate in the third quarter - far beyond the 1.8% rate Fed officials see as the underlying long-term, noninflationary trend.\nThroughout the pandemic era growth has largely exceeded that rate even as inflation has continued to fall, and Powell at his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday tried to square the circle.\n\"People think trend growth over a long period of time is a little less than 2%,\" Powell said. But \"potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level...you're seeing actually elevated potential growth, catch up growth, that can happen\" because of improvements in things like labor supply that, all things equal, allow the economy to grow faster without the same price pressures. Along with more people working, productivity adds a boost as well.\nCAN IT LAST?\nHigher potential growth provides more leeway for the economy to grow without the Fed worrying about the impact on prices. In other words, it offers a wider runway for the \"soft landing\" Fed officials have hoped to engineer with inflation falling but the economy largely left on track.\nRising productivity \"signals receding inflationary pressure even as the economy continues to display notable resilience,\" said EY Senior Economist Lydia Boussour. \"If companies can generate strong productivity growth, they will not be so inclined to pass elevated input costs onto consumers.\"\nThe Fed's situation mimics in some ways the mid-1990s, when Alan Greenspan - the central bank's chief at the time - resisted pressure to raise interest rates, arguing that rising productivity would let the economy grow with less inflation, an insight credited with keeping that decade's strong economic performance on track.\nThe spread of Web-based technologies was still in its relative infancy then, and the years since have produced not only more tempered productivity numbers, but a generally dismal assessment that trend growth in output per worker hour was only around 1.5%. That, coupled with sluggish population growth, is the reason Fed officials in recent years have steadily downgraded their view of the long-term trend growth in overall economic output, with the median fixed at around 1.8% since 2016.\nPowell and his colleagues must now decide just how sustainable the recent improvements are.\nThe upside, as Powell described it, is the possibility of a virtuous cycle developing in which jobs remain plentiful, wages grow, and the economy continues to expand - all with a steady \"disinflation\" as the pace of price pressures fall back to 2%.\n\"The dynamic has been really strong job creation, with wages that are higher than inflation...and that raises real disposable income, that raises spending, which continues to drive more hiring,\" Powell said. \"It has been good. And the thing is, we've been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this.\n\"The question is, how long can that continue?\"\nIf and when it stops, the Fed may face the tougher choice of just how much the economy - the demand side at least - needs to slow to keep inflation in line.\n\"Growth is going to be slower this quarter...Higher rates are dampening activity here and there,\" wrote TSLombard Chief U.S. Economist Steven Blitz. But \"if real growth continues apace, disinflation runs its course and enough inflation eventually returns to pull the Fed back into a tightening cycle.\"\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Dan Burns and Andrea Ricci)",

The nights are very frightening, and so I wanted to get a license for a gun, to be safe, to protect my children,\" she said.\nAghast at the Hamas killing spree in their southern towns and villages, and worried by the military's slow response, Israelis are arming themselves in record numbers with the blessing of their government.\nGun stores and shooting ranges have been working overtime to accommodate the sudden demand, with some former advocates of stricter firearms controls among the new clients.\nIsrael has been bombarding the Gaza Strip since Hamas's attack on Israeli communities on Oct. 7, which it says killed some 1,400 people.\nOn Thursday it said its ground forces had made a big push into Gaza overnight to attack Hamas targets as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was still preparing for a ground invasion that could be one of several.\nAccording to Channel 13 TV, there have been 150,000 applications for gun licenses since the cross-border onslaught - compared to just 42 applications in the same period last year. Firearms sales are highly restricted in Israel, and obtaining a civilian firearms license is no easy feat. An application can sometimes take months.\nSome survivors of the rampage credit the guns they had near to hand, with which they said they defended their homes until security forces arrived - often after delays of several hours.\nThe far-right minister for police, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has also described private gun ownership as a precaution against any recurrence of the internal unrest between Israel's Arab minority and Jewish majority that accompanied the last Gaza war, in 2021.\nNetanyahu has said Israel was in an all-out war against Hamas. This included \"encouraging civilians and helping civilians to arm themselves for their self-defence,\" he said in a televised speech on Wednesday.\nThe gun licenses - usually for pistols, rather than rifles - once took months to process. They can now be obtained in just days online. Before, it was mostly veterans of military combat units or residents of frontline towns who qualified. Now a year of civilian national service can suffice, the police ministry says.\nArab citizens of Israel, many of whom identify as Palestinian, are generally exempted from mandatory conscription and may not be able to get a license.\nBefore Oct. 7, the Kfar Saba Shooting Range was holding just one training course per day, now they\u2019re holding three to four daily.\nGil Shemesh, a firearms instructor at the shooting range, said the swelling number of applicants has been overwhelming and includes \"people living in dangerous areas, to normal people who just want to protect themselves because they saw what happened.\"\nThe company is hiring new instructors just to keep up, he said.\nGun control advocates say making firearms too freely available raises the risk of accidental shootings, murder and suicide.\n\"An untrained response in the event of a subjective sense of danger is liable to bring about the needless death of innocents,\" said an Israeli advocate group called \"Pistol on the Kitchen Table\".\n(Writing by Dan Williams, editing by Deborah Kyvrikosaios)",

        "text": "\n(Refiles to correct French president's first name to Emmanuel instead of Francois, paragraph 20)\n*\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS:\n*\nHamas deputy head says no more exchanges without ceasefire\n*\nU.S. says it wants to see Gaza and West Bank unified\n*\nIsrael wants 'security envelope' around Gaza\nBy Suhaib Salem and Nidal al-Mughrabi\nGAZA, Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said too many innocent Palestinians had been killed in Gaza as Israeli war planes and artillery bombarded the enclave on Saturday following the collapse of a truce with Hamas militants.\nResidents feared the barrages presaged an Israeli ground operation in the south of the Palestinian territory that would pen them into a shrinking area and possibly try to push them across into Egypt.\nThe Gaza health ministry said at least 193 Palestinians had been killed since the truce ended on Friday, adding to the more than 15,000 Palestinian dead since the start of the war. Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas following its Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel in which it says 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage.\nSpeaking in Dubai, Harris said Israel had a right to defend itself, but international and humanitarian law must be respected and \"too many innocent Palestinians have been killed\".\n\"Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering, and the images and videos coming from Gaza, are devastating,\" Harris told reporters.\nShe also sketched out a U.S. vision for post-conflict Gaza, saying the international community must support recovery and Palestinian security forces must be strengthened.\n\"We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the center of this work,\" she said, adding that Hamas must no longer run Gaza.\nThe Western-backed Palestinian Authority governs parts of the occupied West Bank. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' mainstream Fatah party and has ruled the enclave ever since.\nIsrael has vowed to wipe out Hamas once and for all. The Iranian-backed Islamist group is sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction. One of its officials has said Hamas would repeat the Oct 7 attacks if possible.\nMark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel did not want to see Gaza's civilians caught in the crossfire.\nISRAEL SEEKS 'SECURITY ENVELOPE'\n\"Israel is targeting Hamas, a brutal terrorist organization that has committed the most horrific violence against innocent civilians. Israel is making a maximum effort to safeguard Gaza's civilians,\" Regev said.\nHe said that when the war was over, Israel would seek a \"security envelope\" with special zones and arrangements to prevent Hamas from being positioned on its border.\nThroughout Saturday morning, a steady stream of wounded people were carried into the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, some receiving treatment on the floor. Gaza health officials said 650 had been wounded since the truce collapsed.\nThe head of the International Committee of the Red Cross said the renewed fighting was intense.\n\"It's a new layer of destruction coming on top of massive, unparalleled destruction,\" Robert Mardini told Reuters in Dubai.\nWith conditions inside Gaza reaching \"breaking point\", in Mardini's words, the first aid trucks since the end of the truce entered from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, Egyptian security and Red Crescent sources said. Some 100 trucks passed through, carrying food, water and medical supplies, the sources said.\nA senior official said Israel would facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza's civilians.\nThe warring sides blamed each other for the collapse of the seven-day truce, during which Hamas had released hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.\nIsrael said it had recalled a team from Qatar, host of indirect negotiations with Hamas, accusing the Palestinian faction of reneging on a deal to free all the women and children it was holding.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said he was heading to Qatar to work on a new truce.\nThe deputy head of Hamas, however, said no prisoners would be exchanged with Israel unless there is a ceasefire and all Palestinian detainees in Israel are released.\nSaleh Al-Arouri told Al Jazeera TV that Israeli hostages held by Hamas are soldiers and civilian men who previously served in the army.\nBut Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas breached its commitment to free 17 women and children still held in Gaza and insisted that the militant group must keep its word.\nThe latest conflict broke out on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants burst through the Gaza border fence in an onslaught that killed mostly Israeli civilians.\nIsrael responded with a bombing campaign and a ground offensive in the north, destroying swathes of Gaza.\nSOUTH TARGETED\nThe southern part of Gaza including Khan Younis and Rafah was being pounded on Saturday. Residents said houses had been hit and three mosques destroyed in Khan Younis. Columns of smoke rose into the sky.\nDisplaced Gazans have been sheltering in Khan Younis and Rafah because of fighting in the north, but residents said they feared Israeli troops were preparing to move south.\nPalestinian witnesses said Israeli tanks had taken up positions near the road between Khan Younis and Deir Al-Balah.\nYamen, who gave only his first name, fled to Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza from the north after Israel destroyed several districts there.\n\"Where to after Deir Al-Balah, after Khan Younis? I don't know where I would take my wife and six children.\"\nOn Saturday morning, Israeli air strikes hit areas close to the Nasser Hospital six times, medics and witnesses said.\nThe hospital is filled with thousands of displaced and hundreds of wounded, including many of those who had been evacuated from north Gaza hospitals.\n\"A night of horror,\" said Samira, a mother of four. \"It was one of the worst nights we spent in Khan Younis in the past six weeks since we arrived here ... We are so afraid they will enter Khan Younis.\"\nAmong the dead on Saturday was the president of the territory's Islamic University, a theoretical physicist and applied mathematician killed with his family when a house was bombed, health officials said.\nMILITANT TARGETS\nThe Israeli military said that in the space of 24 hours its ground, air and naval forces had hit 400 militant targets and killed an unspecified number of Hamas fighters.\nThese included many in northern Gaza, some in a gun battle at a mosque used by Islamic Jihad militants as a command post.\nHamas said its forces had killed and injured a number of Israeli soldiers in northern Gaza.\nLeaflets dropped by Israel on eastern areas of Khan Younis ordered residents of four towns to evacuate further south to Rafah.\nReuters could not confirm the battlefield accounts.\n(Reporting by Suhaib Salem in Gaza, Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo; additional reporting by Mohammed Salem and Roleen Tafakji in Gaza, Ari Rabinovich and Emily Rose in Jerusalem, Andrew Mills in Doha, Nandita Bose and Steve Holland in Dubai; Writing by Angus MacSwan, Giles Elgood and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Alison Williams)",

It also said that a Barcelona property she bought in May 2012 served as a family home.\n\"It is logically a ruling of conformity that involves a recognition of the facts. But the decision has been motivated by personal issues,\" Miriam Company, one of Shakira's lawyers, told reporters outside the courthouse.\nShe said the legal team was convinced it could prove Shakira's innocence but that the circumstances had changed.\nShakira, 46, lived with former Barcelona and Spain soccer star Gerard Pique for 11 years and the couple have two children. The singer, whose full name is Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, moved to Miami after their separation.\nSpanish authorities have pursued other major celebrities over tax evasion, including soccer players such as Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, Argentina's Lionel Messi and Brazilian-Spanish player Diego Costa. All settled and paid large fines.\nBayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso refused to settle and eventually won a trial against the tax agency. Spain's Supreme Court last month upheld his acquittal.\n($1 = 0.9211 euros) (Writing by Emma Pinedo and Joan Faus; Editing by Aislinn Laing, Inti Landauro, Alexander Smith and Bernadette Baum)",

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration is launching a multi-agency effort to encourage states and cities to convert more empty office buildings into housing units, with billions of federal dollars available to help spur such transitions.\nThe new initiative, announced Friday morning, involves the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Transportation, along with the General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget in a multi-pronged effort to address both the national shortage of affordable housing and the post-pandemic surplus of vacant office buildings.\n\u201cThis presents an area of opportunity to both increase housing supply while revitalizing main streets. It's a win-win,\u201d said Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council. \u201cWe're utilizing resources from across the government.\u201d\nSeveral of the new measures will be designed to specifically encourage the creation of new affordable housing units near transportation hubs like bus terminals and subway stations. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said his department will issue new guidance to states and municipalities on how to access funding through a pair of federal programs \u2014 the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act and Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing.\nButtigieg said that \u201cover $35 billion in lending capacity\u201d will be made available to provide below-market rate loans to finance both new housing construction and office conversions near transportation hubs.\n\u201cThese downtowns and central business districts .. are already designed and oriented around public transit,\u201d Buttigieg said. \"Our intention is to make the most of this opportunity to add more housing near transit in ways that not only reduce the cost of housing but also reduce the cost of transportation.\u201d\nThe Department of Transportation is also releasing new guidance to make it easier for transit agencies to transfer unused properties or buildings to local governments or nonprofit organizations for conversion into affordable housing. Buttigieg said buildings \u201clike an underutilized storage facility\u201d could also be transferred to private developers at below-market prices, provided that those developers commit to including a negotiated percentage of affordable housing units.\nIn addition, the GSA will work with the Office of Management and Budget to identify surplus federal properties that could similarly be transferred for development into affordable housing units.\nThe White House is also releasing a Commercial to Residential Federal Resources Guidebook with over 20 federal programs across six federal agencies that can be used to support conversions. These programs include low-interest loans, loan guarantees, grants and tax incentives for developers.\nCities across the country have struggled to cope with half-empty downtown business districts. Many businesses have embraced a hybrid work from home model with employees coming to the office two or three days a week.\n\u201cThe pandemic really changed the patterns of how many Americans live and work,\u201d Buttigieg said.\nWith fewer employees working from the office, many businesses have abandoned large offices, leaving some downtown property owners struggling with half-empty buildings and city governments struggling with shrinking tax revenue.\nThe trend may actually be continuing even after the end of the pandemic, as businesses are waiting until long-term leases expire and then drastically shrinking the amount of floorspace they occupy. Multiple municipal governments have embraced the idea of office-to-housing conversions, offering tax incentives to developers to help subsidize the often-prohibitive costs of such changes.\nDeputy HUD Secretary Adrianne Todman said the new package of initiatives is designed to \u201creally supercharge\u201d that office-to-housing conversion effort across the country.",

Meanwhile in Washington, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in prepared remarks that he\u2019s \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d that monetary policy is tight enough to reduce inflation.

The move emphasizes traders\u2019 enduring uncertainty over whether Saudi Arabia will extend production cuts as initially expected, he added.\nThe group is heading into the meeting with prices having dropped by about a fifth since late September due to plentiful supplies and concerns about the global economy.

It\u2019s taking place as Putin asserts Russian \u201csovereignty\u201d against the US and its allies ahead of a likely declaration he\u2019ll run for a fifth presidential term in March elections.\nGerman airport operator Fraport, the Qatar Investment Authority, and Russia\u2019s VTB Bank each hold about 25% of Pulkovo\u2019s concession. The remainder is controlled by a consortium of investors including Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, RDIF, Mubadala and Baring Vostok, according to the Interfax news service.\nPutin told the government to create a new management body for the operator of Pulkovo, which is Russia\u2019s busiest airport after Domodedovo in Moscow and served 17.5 million passengers through October this year. St. Petersburg also has a military airport, Levashovo.\nWhile Germany is viewed as \u201cunfriendly\u201d by the Kremlin, Qatar and Abu Dhabi are not. Putin\u2019s decree potentially left open the door for the Middle East investors to regain their voting rights by saying stakeholders could restore them \u201cupon their application, subject to the conclusion of corporate agreements with other participants in the company and upon the assumption of obligations to comply with Russian legislation.\u201d\nThe order on Pulkovo relied on laws signed long before Putin\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and was based on a \u201cthreat to the national interests and economic security of the Russian Federation resulting from the violation of obligations by certain foreign legal entities.\u201d\nThat differed from earlier Kremlin takeovers of the local operations of international holdings, which were based on legislation Putin signed in April that allowed Russia to impose temporary state control over the assets of companies or individuals from \u201cunfriendly states.\u201d\nIt seized Russian plants owned by Danone SA and Carlsberg A/S in July and installed allies of Putin to run them. Russia also took control of utilities owned by Finland\u2019s Fortum Oyj and Germany\u2019s Uniper SE.\nFraport is evaluating the consequences of the Kremlin\u2019s decision, a spokesman said. The company has already written down the value of the holding to zero following the attack on Ukraine, and there\u2019s been no interaction with Russia or any transfer of money in either direction since then, he said.\nQIA and Mubadala declined to comment.\nPulkovo airport welcomed Putin\u2019s order, saying it would \u201crestore corporate governance mechanisms,\u201d RIA Novosti reported, citing the company\u2019s statement.\n--With assistance from Benedikt Kammel and Nicolas Parasie.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAnduril Builds a Tiny, Reusable Fighter Jet That Blows Up Drones\nB-School Admissions Deans Are Feeling The Pressure From Falling Applications\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

It said on Sunday it considered the board's decision \"unlawful\", adding it would use \"any legal means at its disposal to challenge\" it.\nIn Vivendi's view, the sale required an extraordinary shareholder vote. Vivendi also wanted clearance from an internal TIM board committee for related party transactions, given the Treasury's double role as owner of TIM shareholder CDP and investor in the grid.\nTIM on Sunday also dismissed as not in line with its strategy an alternative plan pitched in recent weeks by London-based investment firm Merlyn Advisors, which Vivendi had called on the board to assess.\n\"Merlyn ... reserves the right to take any steps to bring the board to call ... a shareholder meeting to decide whether the plan approved on Sunday is what shareholders want,\" Merlyn said in a note.\nTIM worked with advisers Goldman Sachs, Mediobanca and Vitale & Co as well as law firm Gatti Pavesi Bianchi Ludovici. Citi, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan advised KKR. UBS worked with the Treasury.\nEquita, Lion Tree and Studio Carbonetti supported TIM's independent directors.

December 2024 is the target for a test flight, with ambitions to start commercial service four years later, Shin said in an interview this week with Bloomberg News in Singapore.\n\u201cConsidering all the battery technology and all the infrastructure and regulation to come along, it\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d he said.\nBatteries are the biggest technical challenge for electric air mobility, accounting for up to 40% of an eVTOL craft\u2019s weight. \u201cThat\u2019s really the killer,\u201d Shin said.\n\u201cFrom the operation side, we don\u2019t have air traffic management systems to govern these vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cUp until this point, even the foreseeable future, we don\u2019t have man-made objects flying routinely below 500 meters.\u201d\nNext Steps\nWashington, DC-based Supernal will submit an application to the US Federal Aviation Administration in the coming months to get the eVTOL certified. Given how young the industry is, companies and regulators need to collaborate to figure out the best paths forward, Shin said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing out there \u2014 no infrastructure, no policy, no regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cSince it\u2019s so brand new, the FAA doesn\u2019t have an established certification method.\u201d\nHyundai already has a factory producing cars in Alabama, while affiliate Kia Corp. has a plant in Georgia. Shin didn\u2019t provide investment figures for the planned Supernal plant, or its size, potential location or other details.\nSupernal joins an increasingly crowded field of companies trying to get eVTOL vehicles certified. EHang Holdings Ltd. is a step ahead after receiving a certificate to begin trial aerial operations in China, while California-based Joby Aviation Inc., with backers including Delta Air Lines Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp., also has approval from the FAA to test its flying taxis.\nRacing to catch up, Supernal opened a new engineering headquarters in Irvine, California, in July and a new R&D facility in Fremont two months later. Its workforce has doubled from last year to nearly 600, with many coming from Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Tesla Inc., according to Shin.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to hire more because we\u2019re going start the flight testing next year,\u201d he said.\nIn the two years since Supernal was founded, Hyundai, Kia and Hyundai Mobis Co. have invested about 1.2 trillion won ($920 million) into the company, filings show. With funding coming from Hyundai, Supernal doesn\u2019t plan an initial public offering, Shin said.\nThe company last month also signed an agreement with Korean Air to work together on air mobility for the South Korean market. Speaking at an aviation conference in Singapore on Tuesday, the airline\u2019s CEO Walter Cho said vertical mobility vehicles will likely first be used to carry cargo and then evolve.\n\u201cI have to be confident enough to get on it myself,\u201d Cho said.\nEvolution of eVTOL Aircraft\nFor transporting people, air mobility craft such as eVTOL taxis will initially be limited to \u201cvery progressive cities,\u201d but they have the potential to spread rapidly once the public becomes more comfortable and familiar with them, similar to how people adapted to mobile phones and elevators, Shin said.\n\u201cThe inflection point will come real fast,\u201d he said.\nHyundai\u2019s mass-production know-how puts Supernal in a strong position as demand for alternative public transport increases with more people moving to urban areas, Shin added. \u201cAll of a sudden, the world market will demand hundreds of thousands of these vehicles, then you have to be able to produce.\u201d\nThe United Nations says 70% of the global population will live in cities by 2030.\n\u201cUrbanization is happening like crazy everywhere,\u201d Shin said.\nBut with work still needed to be done on battery technology and regulation, 2028 is the \u201cright timing\u201d to aim for a commercial launch.\n--With assistance from Danny Lee and Emily Yamamoto.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nMarvel\u2019s Latest Movie Will Show If Superheroes Ever Get Tired\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

It contracted to 17.9% between July and September from 25.1% a year earlier due the EV maker's rampant price cuts, which also triggered a price war in key markets such as China.\nTesla was trading at about 56 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with 5.6 times for Ford and General Motors' 4.1, according to LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

The plant near Charlotte is doubling its capacity due to increased demand for electric vehicles spurred by consumer tax credits of up $7,500 approved in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\nIn excerpts of remarks to be delivered at the plant, Yellen said similar investments were taking place across the country, with $614 billion worth of clean energy investments and manufacturing projects announced since the Biden administration took office in 2021. These include $142 billion in EVs and batteries and $71 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and she attributed much of the investment to tax credits in the inflation reduction act.\n\"We're seeing the emergence of a battery belt across the Midwest and South,\" Yellen said, adding that this would bolster U.S. energy security reducing American dependence on China's EV battery supply chain.\nThe Biden administration in coming days is expected to release new guidance on the levels of Chinese content that EV batteries can have and still qualify for IRA tax credits. The Livent plant processes lithium brine largely from Argentina and Canada.\nYellen said the bulk of investments spurred by the legislation was flowing to counties with below-average college graduation rates, providing good jobs \"where they are most needed.\"\nSTRONG GROWTH, LITTLE CREDIT\nIncreased investment in new manufacturing projects, machinery and warehouses, which also include new semiconductor plants, helped the U.S. economy to grow at a torrid 5.2% annual pace in the third quarter, defying predictions earlier this year that it was headed for a recession.\nBut Biden has struggled to win voter confidence in his handling of the economy, with polls earlier this month showing Republican frontrunner Donald Trump ahead in five of the six most important battleground states.\nVoters remain deeply scarred by the higher living costs brought about by post-pandemic inflation, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. It will take time for this to fade and for people to feel the benefits of higher wages, he added.\n\"People are hearing that things are getting much better, inflation is coming down and we're not coming into a recession,\" Sabato said. \"But in their lives every week, when they go to the gas station or into the grocery store, they still perceive higher prices, and their minds are oriented to bad news. And people are going to blame the president.\" (Reporting by David Lawder and Howard Schneider; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",

The EU-wide platform now has almost 3 million vacancies, a vivid illustration of how third-country nationals could profit.\nOn top of the platforms, the plan calls for measures to cut red tape when it comes to professional qualifications so that job seekers should not be held back for months and years because of diverging paperwork.\nThe plans will now be assessed by the 27 member states and the EU's parliament before they can be turned into reality.\nIn the meantime, the issue gets mixed up in the overall European debate on migration, where labor concerns often get short shrift in a shrill debate that often spills over into raw racism. The theme will also be key in next Wednesday's parliamentary elections in the Netherlands.\nEconomically too, the urgency is there, and EU businesses realize they are facing competitors across the globe.\n\u201cEurope is engaged in a global race for talent, the same way that we are fighting a global race for raw materials or energy,\u201d Schinas said, mentioning the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia as prime rivals.\nSuch is the need that even the EU's economic juggernaut, Germany, is looking for some extraordinary measures. Two weeks ago, the government approved legislation that would allow asylum-seekers to start working earlier even if their situation has not fully been settled.\nThe German package still requires parliamentary approval and is the latest in a series of steps taken recently by the government as it tries to defuse migration as a major political problem. The issue was one of several that led to a poor showing in state elections last month for Chancellor OIaf Scholz\u2019s quarrelsome three-party coalition and gains for a far-right party.\nSchinas had no doubt the battle with the far-right would continue.\n\u201cWe will continue to oppose this populist discourse that Europe is either incapable of doing anything on migration, or opening the floodgates we are not doing either. We are working for a regulatory solution long term,\u201d he said.",

In August, four miners were killed after a fire erupted at the same mine, while five people died following a methane leak at another site in November 2022.\nThe company confirmed Saturday that it was finalizing a deal with the Kazakh government to nationalize the firm amid growing discontent from officials.\nPrime Minister Alikhan Smailov said in a statement on the Kazakh president\u2019s website the government had reached a preliminary agreement with the company's shareholders and was now in the process of \u201cformalizing\u201d the nationalization.\nSpeculation around the company's future had been growing since September, when Kazakhstan\u2019s first deputy prime minister, Roman Sklyar, told journalists that the government had started talks with potential investors to buy out ArcelorMittal after becoming increasingly unhappy with its failure to meet investment obligations and repeated worker safety violations.\nSpeaking on Saturday, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced Oct. 29 as a national day of mourning in Kazakhstan. The office of the country\u2019s Prosecutor General has also said it was starting an investigation into potential safety violations in the coal mine.\nIn a statement, ArcelorMittal Temirtau said that work had been halted at all of their coal mining sites in Kazakhstan. It also conveyed \u201cpain\u201d at the lives lost and said its efforts \u201care now aimed at ensuring that affected employees receive comprehensive care and rehabilitation, as well as close cooperation with government authorities.\u201d\nArcelorMittal Temirtau is the local representative for Luxembourg-based multinational ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s second-largest steel producer.\nBesides worker safety concerns, ArcelorMittal Temirtau has also fallen under scrutiny in recent years for its environmental violations.\nThe Kazakh city of Temirtau \u2014 the company\u2019s namesake and home of its steel plant \u2014 made global headlines in 2018 after being blanketed in black snow, a phenomenon that the company attributed to a lack of wind.\nIn November 2021, local residents also shared videos of the town carpeted in fine, magnetic dust.\nFollowing the November 2022 deaths, Tokayev said that more than 100 workers had died at ArcelorMittal sites in Kazakhstan since 2006.",

        "text": "\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Republicans floated changes Wednesday to a funding proposal for Milwaukee Brewers stadium repairs including a new tax on non-Brewers events, seeking to win over skeptics of the current plan intended to keep the team at American Family Field until at least 2050.\nA Brewers official testified at a state Senate hearing Wednesday that the team didn't want to leave the city, saying it didn't make sense to build a new stadium and that the priority was making urgent repairs extend the life of the 22-year-old ballpark.\n\u201cWe want to be here for the next generation,\" said Rick Schlesinger, president of business operations for the Brewers. \"The last thing I want to do is figure out a way to leave. ... I\u2019m not here threatening to leave. I want to be here.\u201d\nWhile the stadium funding plan cleared the Assembly with bipartisan support last week, it does not have a majority of Republican support yet in the Senate. It must pass both houses in identical form before it can be sent to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has voiced support for the current plan.\nMore changes may yet be needed to win over wary Senate Republicans, like increasing payments from the Brewers to decrease the state\u2019s contribution, said Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to try and get to 17,\u201d LeMahieu told reporters, referring to the number of Senate votes needed to pass the bill. \u201cI believe we can get there.\u201d\nRepublicans hold a 22-11 majority and LeMahieu said he hoped the measure would win bipartisan support in the Senate as it did in the Assembly.\nThe proposed tax on non-Brewers events and other changes are being discussed and may be introduced, bill co-sponsor Rep. Robert Brooks testified at a Senate committee hearing.\nSuch a tax would apply to all non-Brewers events, everything from monster truck rallies to George Strait concerts, Brooks said.\nTaxing Brewers games is a \u201cnon-starter\u201d with the team, which does support a ticket tax for non-Brewers events, Brooks said.\nThe ticket tax could offset the state's $411 million contribution, Brooks said. There's also talk of forming an advisory board that includes the Brewers and local governmental officials to look at development of land around the stadium, including parking lots, Brooks said.\nUnder the current plan, the city of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County would put forward a combined $135 million in addition to the state share. Milwaukee's leaders support the proposal, which calls for less money from the city and county than an earlier version. The Brewers would contribute $100 million and agree to extend their lease at the stadium through 2050.\nDemocratic Sen. Kelda Roys, of Madison, said she wanted to see the state's share decrease.\n\u201cEvery dollar that we\u2019re spending on the Brewers is money that can\u2019t go to our other priorities,\" she said.\nPublic funding for professional sports facilities is hotly debated across the country. The Brewer\u2019s principal owner, Mark Attanasio, has an estimated net worth of $700 million, according to Yahoo Finance. The team itself is valued at around $1.6 billion, according to Forbes.\nThe Brewers are pushing for renovations at 22-year-old American Family Field, arguing that glass outfield doors, seats and concourses should be replaced and that luxury suites and video scoreboards need upgrades. They said the stadium\u2019s signature retractable roof, fire suppression systems, parking lots, elevators and escalators need work, as well.\nUpgrades could include winterizing the stadium so it can host concerts, conventions and other sporting events throughout the year, said bill co-sponsor Republican Sen. Dan Feyen.\nLawmakers trying to broker a deal have warned that without one, the Brewers and the tax revenue they generate will leave the state.\nAccording to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, baseball operations at the stadium currently generate about $19.8 million annually in state and local taxes. That is expected to grow to $50.7 million annually by 2050, according to the fiscal bureau.\nAmerican Family Field opened in 2001 as Miller Park, replacing aging County Stadium. Construction cost about $392 million and was funded largely through a 0.1% sales tax imposed in Milwaukee County and four surrounding counties. The stadium was renamed American Family Field in 2021.",

The company plans to start a formal pitch early next year, said the people, who declined to be identified citing confidential information.\nThe new fund would be the largest ever for Everstone if it meets the target, even as private equity groups globally struggle to raise fresh funds amid soaring interest rates and slowing economic growth. Carlyle Group Inc.\u2019s top executive said this week he was not pleased with the pace of fundraising this year.\nIndia\u2019s not immune to the slowdown, with just $1.7 billion raised by buyout and venture funds in the first seven months of this year, down from a record $8.5 billion in 2022, according to data from Preqin Ltd.\n\u201cSo far, 2023 has been a tough year, with both deal-making and fundraising bearing the full brunt of these macroeconomic headwinds,\u201d Preqin said in a recent report.\nThe new fund would be more than three times bigger than its predecessor fund, Everstone Capital Partners IV, which collected about $300 million last year, the people said. Everstone refers to the fourth fund as an \u201cinterim\u201d or \u201cbridge\u201d fund as it waited for the macro-economic environment to improve for a larger fund, they said.\nEverstone declined to comment on its fundraising plans.\nThe firm, started by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives Sameer Sain and Atul Kapur in 2006, wrapped up its first fund with $425 million in 2006, followed by $580 million for a second fund in 2010 and $730 million for a third fund in 2016.\nInvestors in Everstone\u2019s prior funds include International Finance Corp., the World Bank\u2019s private-sector arm, which committed $60 million to the fourth fund.\nEverstone pivoted from taking minority stakes in businesses to taking control of firms from its second fund. Since its third, the company has been following a \u201cbuy and build\u201d model, which involves buying a mid-sized business and making acquisitions to help the business grow, the people said. The firm invests in digital tech services in India, along with healthcare, industrial, consumer and financial services companies.\nLast year, the firm acquired Cprime Inc., a US digital technology consulting and solutions company, alongside Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

        "text": "\nBy Tom Wilson\nLONDON(Reuters) - The Ethereum blockchain's historical greenhouse gas emissions before a major software upgrade last year were equivalent to the yearly emissions of Honduras, a University of Cambridge study showed on Friday.\nBlockchains - the digital ledgers that underpin cryptocurrencies - typically consume large amounts of energy as they produce coins and process transactions, drawing criticism from environmentalists and some investors.\nYet calculating the environmental impact of the crypto sector is fraught with difficulty, given its relative opacity and lack of centralised data.\nGlobal leaders and delegates from nearly 200 countries are gathering for the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, with how to maximise energy efficiency in industry among questions on the agenda.\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain - which hosts the world's second biggest token ether - underwent a major software upgrade known as the \"Merge,\" which drastically reduced its energy usage.\nFrom its launch in 2015 until the Merge, Ethereum's greenhouse gas emissions totalled 27.5 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), the study showed. Honduras emitted 27.7 MtCO2e in 2020, according to Climate Watch.\nUnder its post-Merge system, Ethereum uses over 99% less energy, developers say. Its current yearly emissions are around 2.8 kilotonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, the study found - around the same as five round-trip flights from London to New York.\nIt is generally thought that blockchain is \"a highly emitting technology,\" said Anna Lerner, executive director at the Ethereum Climate Platform, an organisation that seeks to use blockchain tech to accelerate climate finance. \"Ethereum has shown that it doesn't have to be such a polluter,\" she said.\nThe study is among the most thorough examinations of Ethereum's historical emissions, its author, Alexander Neumueller, research lead for digital assets climate impact at the University of Cambridge, told Reuters.\nBitcoin, in comparison, creates about 73.9 MtCO2e a year, Neumueller said, based on its daily emissions in November 2022.\nThe annual emissions of Bitcoin, the largest blockchain and cryptocurrency, are therefore roughly equivalent to those of Cambodia in 2020, according to Climate Watch.\nCrypto tokens such as bitcoin and ether remain primarily an investment tool, with little widespread practical usage in business or commerce.\n(Reporting by Tom Wilson; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)",

        "text": "\n(Adds details, analyst comments throughout, updates markets)\n*\nThird-quarter GDP increases at 4.9% rate\n*\nConsumer spending accelerates; business investment soft\n*\nInventory accumulation, government spending offer boost\nBy Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew almost 5% in the third quarter, again defying dire warnings of a recession, as higher wages from a tight labor market helped to fuel consumer spending and businesses restocked at a brisk clip to meet the strong demand.\nThe fastest growth pace in nearly two years reported by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday in its advance estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product was also spurred by a rebound in residential investment after contracting for nine straight quarters.\nGovernment spending picked up. But business investment dipped for the first time in two years as outlays on equipment like computers declined and the boost faded from the construction of factories related to a campaign by President Joe Biden's administration to encourage more semiconductor manufacturing in the United States.\nThough the blockbuster performance over the summer is likely not sustainable, it showcased the economy's stamina despite aggressive interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. Growth could slow in the fourth quarter because of the United Auto Workers strikes, the resumption of student loan repayments by millions of Americans and the lagged effects of the rate hikes.\nThe report also showed underlying inflation subsiding considerably last quarter. Most economists have revised their forecasts and now believe the Fed can engineer a \"soft-landing\" for the economy, citing expectations that the July-September period will show a continuation of second-quarter strength in worker productivity and moderation in unit labor costs.\n\"We've seen for a period of time now a post pandemic induced negative bias about an imminent recession and persistent inflation,\" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. \"But not only is the economy surprisingly resilient, we also got productivity-driven growth for two consecutive quarters in 2023, meaning the business cycle still looks very solid.\"\nGross domestic product increased at a 4.9% annualized rate last quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 4.3% rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the April-June quarter and is expanding at a pace well above what Fed officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%.\nGrowth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, accelerated at a 4.0% rate after only rising at a 0.8% pace in the second quarter. It added 2.69 percentage points to GDP growth, and was driven by spending on both goods and services.\nThough wage growth has slowed, it is rising a bit faster than inflation, lifting households' purchasing power.\nThe increase in wages last quarter was partially offset by a rise in personal taxes, resulting in income at the disposal of households after taxes falling at a 1.0% pace. That led to consumers tapping their savings to fund some of their spending. The saving rate dropped to 3.8% from 5.2% in the second quarter.\nStocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields dipped.\nSLOWDOWN AHEAD\nThe declining saving rate combined with the resumption of student loan repayments in October, which economists estimated was equal to roughly $70 billion, or around 0.3% of disposable personal income, could dent spending. Low-income consumers are increasingly relying on debt to fund purchases, with higher borrowing costs boosting credit card delinquencies.\nEconomists estimate that excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic are mostly concentrated among high-income households and will run out by the first quarter of 2024. Some economists see a sharp slowdown around the corner, a concern shared by United Parcel Service, which on Thursday cut its 2023 revenue forecast for the second straight quarter.\nBut others are not too worried, arguing that spending was not reliant on credit, but rather on the strong labor market and generous government transfers during the pandemic.\n\"It is too early to take slower growth for granted, especially after three quarters of consistently stronger-than-expected economic activity,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. \"Any economist working on an update of their estimate of when pandemic savings will run out needs to tear it up and start thinking about what has allowed consumption to remain so strong. It is not borrowing.\"\nLabor market resilience was highlighted by a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday, showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 during the week ending Oct. 21, staying in the very low end of their range of 194,000 to 265,000 for this year.\nThe number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 63,000 to 1.790 million for the week ended Oct. 14, the highest since early May. Economists were divided on whether this was a sign that the unemployed were experiencing longer spells of joblessness or reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations.\nInventory accumulation rose at an $80.6 billion pace last quarter, contributing 1.32 percentage points to GDP growth. Businesses relied on imports to restock, resulting in a small trade deficit that imposed a minor drag on GDP growth. Excluding inventories and trade, the economy grew at a solid 3.5% rate.\nThe GDP data likely has no impact on near-term monetary policy amid a surge in U.S. Treasury yields and a recent stock market selloff, which have tightened financial conditions.\nUnderlying price pressures abated further, with the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) excluding food and energy rising at a 2.4% rate. That was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2020 and followed a 3.7% pace of increase in the second quarter.\nThe so-called core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the Fed for its 2% target. The U.S. central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged next Wednesday. It has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25% to 5.50% range since March of last year.\n\"From the Fed perspective there is little here to suggest any need to start lowering rates, nor does this suggest an imminent need to raise them again either,\" said Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair in London.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Andrea Ricci and Chizu Nomiyama)",

        "text": "\nWith the ever-increasing cost of college and many students graduating with crippling student debt, more high school graduates are considering trade schools and other non-college options instead. Students can learn a specific occupation using a combination of classroom instruction and hands-on practice. Once they graduate, they often work under an experienced tradesperson as an apprentice, where they continue to learn the ins and outs of their chosen trade.\nHere Are: Best Banks for Early Direct Deposit\nAlso: All of the States That Will Pay Off Your Student Loans\nEven though apprenticeships are still technically a training period, the salaries can be eye-popping for the highest-demand jobs. Here are some apprenticeships where you can earn $100,000 a year \u2014 and make your student loan debt disappear.\nA degree in computer science isn\u2019t necessarily required for some software developer positions. Some \u201clow-code\u201d development platforms allow developers to create applications with minimal coding, and these are skills that can be learned under the guidance of an experienced developer. Candidates should have previous experience in coding and technical knowledge of databases and system integration.\nWhile an electrician apprentice won\u2019t typically earn $100,000 right out of trade school, those who have been apprentices for two or three years, and who choose to specialize in a specific type of electrical work, may find themselves at or above that pay grade. Union electricians typically earn more than those who work for independent electrical contractors.\nMany sales positions are commission-based, and this one is no different. Boat sales is a specialized market, however, and learning the business could lead to significant earnings over the course of a career. Sales apprenticeship programs typically provide training and sales coaching and also have lead generation programs to provide a steady stream of prospects.\nPlumber\u2019s apprentices install plumbing equipment and fixtures in new construction, and also repair and replace fixtures in existing buildings. As with many construction trades, union members often make more money and have better benefits than their non-union counterparts.\nResidential service estimators examine and assess existing homes to provide estimates to repair or replace items like windows, chimneys and fireplaces. There is sometimes a sales component to this job, with commissions being paid when the customer purchases replacement products or services.\nAn automotive technician apprentice learns to troubleshoot and repair automobiles under the guidance of an experienced technician. Some technicians are trained on certain makes of automobiles and may work for a dealership rather than an independent mechanic who works on many different makes of cars. Those technicians that are trained by the manufacturer may command a higher wage.\nThe workers who install, repair and replace utility lines start out as apprentices as they learn to install new utility service and restore service after storms and other natural disasters.\nReal estate agents are paid on commission, so it\u2019s possible to earn $100,000 per year or more if you live and work in an area of expensive homes where there is high demand. Some real estate brokerages will hire apprentices to learn from experienced brokers, and they have commission goals of $100,000 or more. Whether or not an apprentice can reach that goal depends on several factors, including their drive and sales ability.\nHair stylists and barbers just starting out can learn a lot from their more experienced colleagues. Apprentices may start by helping other stylists with things like shampooing, as they are learning more complicated cuts and color processes. Based on an hourly wage plus tips, a full-time hair stylist or barber could earn $100,000 per year depending on their clientele.\nSponsored: Open a new checking account and earn early paycheck access; up to 2 days early with Discover\u00ae Cashback Debit with Early Pay\nOne thing to note about the trades in general \u2014 and about apprenticeships, in particular \u2014 is that these are typically hourly wage positions. They may include benefits, like health insurance, a 401(k) and so on, but as an hourly worker, you are only paid when you work. (On the other hand, many apprenticeship and trade jobs pay extra for overtime, which is anything more than 40 hours in a week.) Tradespeople hired for a specific project will need to find another job when the project is complete and may have to go where the work is in order to consistently be employed.\nWhether you want to avoid having to take on student loans to finance a college education, or the idea of four more years of classroom learning simply doesn\u2019t appeal, perhaps an apprenticeship is for you.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nLiving Frugally: Adopting Lessons From the Great Depression\nThe Average Retirement Age in 2023 in the US vs Canada\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n7 Ways To Squeeze the Absolute Most Out of an Average Salary\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 9 Apprenticeships Where You\u2019ll Earn $100K a Year and Be Student Loan Free",

All three major averages closed the three-and-a-half days of trading up about 1%.\n\nBroadly, the week ahead will provide a test for the current market as stocks ended Friday pacing toward their best monthly gain in more than a year.\nThursday's inflation reading will offer a final chance for economic data to derail the current narrative bolstering stocks that the US economy may be headed for a \"soft landing,\" in which inflation retreats to the central bank's 2% target without a severe economic downturn.\nRead more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nRecent economic data has fallen in line with that path, sending beaten-up areas of the stock market like small-cap stocks and meme stocks into rally mode.\nThis data has pushed around expectations for the Fed too, with markets now pricing in just a 12% chance the Fed raises rates again, according to data from the CME Group.\nEconomists expect annual inflation according to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge \u2014 \"core\" PCE \u2014 clocked in at 3.5% in October. Over the prior month, economists expect \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%.\nIn a note to clients this month, JPMorgan's chief US economist Michael Feroli noted this 0.2% monthly rise \"would leave the 3- and 6-month annualized gains in that measure at 2.5% and 2.6%,\" much closer to the Fed's 2% target than October's 12-month gain is set to show.\n\"Those increases are close enough to the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation goal that most on the FOMC are likely content to stand pat on policy and let cooling labor market activity finish the job of getting inflation back to target,\" Feroli added. \"We continue to think the next move from the Fed is toward easier policy, but not until 3Q24.\"\nEarlier this month, stocks surged and bonds rallied \u2014 which sent yields lower \u2014 after October's Consumer Price Index showed inflation continued to slow last month.\nOn the corporate side, a smattering of quarterly results will provide investors with a further look at the health of the consumer, a look at the state of software demand, and whether AI is moving the needle for these businesses' customers.\nFoot Locker, Ulta Beauty, and Dollar Tree will be closely monitored for any forecasts regarding the holiday season and commentary on whether elevated interest rates and a softening labor market are pushing consumers to trade down.\nSalesforce's guidance for the current quarter will be scrutinized by the Street, with analysts at Goldman Sachs noting this period captures when customers decide on renewals and add-ons for next year's service.\nWall Street analysts expect the company's results to reveal how companies paying for cloud services or tools like Slack are responding to price increases. Updates on demand for Salesforce's AI products will also be in focus.\n\"Customers continue to optimize spend, reduce shelf ware, and prioritize software that delivers near-term value creation, resulting in a challenging demand environment for [Salesforce],\" Citi analyst Tyler Radke wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\nResults from Workday, Intuit, Snowflake, and Okta should hit on similar themes in the coming week.\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity (-16 expected, -19.2 previously); New home sales, October (723,000 annualized rate expected, 759,000 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, October (-4.8% expected, +12.3% previously)\nEarnings: Zscaler (ZS)\nEconomic data: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, November (101 expected, 102.6 previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, September (+0.9% expected, +1.01% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, September (+4.2% expected, +2.16% previously)\nEarnings: CrowdStrike (CRWD), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intuit (INTU), Workday (WDAY)\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Nov. 24 (+3.0% prior); Wholesale inventories month-over-month, October (+0.2% previously); Third quarter GDP, second estimate (+5.0% annualized rate expected, +4.9% previously); Third quarter personal consumption, second estimate (+2.4% annualized expected; +2.4% previously)\nEarnings: Dollar Tree (DLTR), Foot Locker (FL), Five Below (FIVE), Hormel Foods (HRL), La-Z-Boy (LZB), Okta (OKTA), Petco (WOOF), Snowflake (SNOW), Salesforce (CRM), Victoria's Secret (VSCO)\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ended Nov. 25 (218,000 expected, 209,000 previously); Continuing jobless claims, week ended Nov. 18 (1.87 million expected, 1.84 million previously); Personal income, month-over-month, October (+0.2% expected, +0.3% previously); Personal spending, month-over-month, October (+0.2% expected, +0.7% previously); PCE inflation, month-over-month, October (+0.1% expected,+ 0.4% previously); PCE inflation, year-over-year, October (+3.1% expected, +3.4% previously); \"Core\" PCE, month-over-month, October (+0.2% expected, +0.3% previously); \"Core\" PCE, year-over-year, October (+3.5% expected; +3.7% previously)\nEarnings: Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Big Lots (BIG), Build-A-Bear (BBW), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Dell (DELL), Kroger (KR), Marvell (MRVL), TD Bank (TD), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\nEconomic news: S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI, November final (49.4 previously); ISM manufacturing, November (47.7 expected, 46.7 previously)\nEarnings: Bank of Montreal (BMO)\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "text": "\nBy Siddharth Cavale\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retail chain Walmart on Monday said it is investing more than $9 billion over a two-year period to upgrade and modernize some U.S. stores with improved layouts, expanded product selections and new tech additions.\nOn Friday, 117 stores in 30 states will be re-launched showcasing the enhancements, representing investments of more than $500 million, Walmart said in a statement. In total, it plans to modernize more than 1,400 of its 4,717 Walmart stores across the country. The remodels do not apply to its warehouse club chain, Sam's Club, a spokesperson said.\n\"These construction investments allow us to create more local jobs and make it easier for our associates to get customers what they want, when they want it,\" John Furner, chief executive officer of Walmart's U.S. business said.\nWalmart's low-cost and low-margin groceries have been a big draw for Americans dealing with steep inflation in food prices, including eggs, protein and chocolate, over the past two years. In 2022, the company's sales surpassed $600 billion, a record.\nNow the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer wants to change its image from merely a steep discounter to a destination where customers can also purchase fashionable home goods and clothing.\nAs part of those efforts, the company tested some remodeled concept stores called \"Stores of the Future\" at a few Walmart Supercenters, including Teterboro in New Jersey, earlier this year. Executives have previously said the concept was a success, with same-store sales rising by a few percentage points and in Teterboro's case, as much as 20%.\nMonday's investments mark the national rollout of that concept, a Walmart spokesperson said.\nThe enhanced stores will have refreshed interiors and exteriors, with new paint, updated flooring, modernized restrooms, LED-lighting and new signage for brighter and easier navigation through the stores, the company said.\nCustomers also will see increased check-out options, including staffed lanes and self-checkout areas, and more grab-and-go food and beverage options in its grocery areas.\nStores will also host bigger pharmacies with private screening rooms for pharmacist consultations and services, and digital screens and QR codes that offer information on Walmart's services offered online, the company said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",

Tens of thousands of people gathered on Washington\u2019s National Mall to express support for Israel in one of the largest such demonstrations since the war began.\nFor more stories on the Israel-Hamas war, click here.\nAll time stamps are Israeli time:\nNetanyahu-Trudeau Trade Barbs Over Casualties (5:15 a.m.)\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back publicly at Justin Trudeau after the Canadian prime minister lamented \u201cthe human tragedy that is unfolding in Gaza is heart-wrenching, especially the suffering we see in and around the Al Shifa Hospital.\u201d\nNetanyahu, in a social media post, said Israel is doing all it can to protect civilians and that Hamas is responsible \u201cfor committing a double war crime \u2014 targeting civilians while hiding behind civilians.\u201d\nIsraeli Troops Reported in Hospital Basement (5:00 a.m.)\nA spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Al Jazeera that Israeli troops were searching through the basement of the Shifa hospital. Israel has said Hamas uses areas beneath hospital facilities, including basements and tunnels, to hide troops and store weapons.\nBiden-Netanyahu Discussed Hostage Situation (4:09 a.m.)\nBiden spoke with Netanyahu Tuesday afternoon about efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas, the White House said in a statement.\nIt wasn\u2019t clear if the two leaders spoke before the Israel Defense Forces operation at the Shifa hospital, or if Biden was informed of Israel\u2019s plans. White House officials said they had intelligence suggesting that some of those captured during the Oct. 7 raid on Israel had been held under the hospital complex.\nTroops Reported Inside Hospital Compound (3:45 a.m.)\nRegional news channels Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya said the Israeli military had entered the Shifa hospital compound, following the IDF statement that it would carry out an operation against Hamas at the facility.\nThe scale of the Israeli move wasn\u2019t immediately clear, but the decision is likely to fuel international criticism, even after Israel said Hamas used the hospital and other medical facilities to hide its forces. Hamas rejects the charge.\nHundreds of patients, medical personnel and displaced civilians were at the Shifa hospital in recent days, and supplies of medicine and fuel were believed to be running very low.\nIsraeli Forces Begin Operation at Key Gaza Hospital (2:10 a.m.)\nIsrael Defense Forces said they are \u201ccarrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital.\u201d In a statement, the IDF said that they had \u201cconveyed to the relevant authorities in Gaza once again that all military activities within the hospital must cease within 12 hours. Unfortunately, it did not.\u201d\nHamas has denied using the facility as a base of operations. A health ministry official at the hospital told Bloomberg that Israeli tanks were at the gates of the complex.\nPentagon Sends More Armaments to Israel (12:30 a.m.)\nThe Pentagon has quietly stepped up military aid to Israel, delivering on requests that include more laser-guided missiles for its Apache gunship fleet, as well as 155mm shells, night-vision devices, bunker-buster munitions and new army vehicles, according to an internal Defense Department list.\nThe weapons pipeline to Israel is extending beyond the well-publicized provision of Iron Dome interceptors and Boeing Co. smart bombs. It continues even as Biden administration officials increasingly caution the Israeli government to try to avoid civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.\nTens of Thousands Turn Out in Washington to Support Israel (10:20 p.m.)\nTens of thousands of people gathered on Washington\u2019s National Mall to express support for Israel in one of the largest such demonstrations since the war began.\nCongressional leaders addressed the crowd, denouncing what they said was rising antisemitism and pledging continued backing for Israel. Organizers said the event drew more than 200,000 people, but there was no official confirmation of that estimate.\nSecurity was tight at the event, but there were no immediate reports of violence. Thousands of supporters of Palestinians demonstrated in Washington on Nov. 5.\nUS Says Intelligence Confirms Hamas Hides Under Hospitals (9:40 p.m.)\nThe US has intelligence confirming Israel\u2019s assertion that Hamas and other Iran-backed militant groups are using hospitals \u2014 including the central Al-Shifa facility in Gaza \u2014 to conceal and support their operations, the White House said.\nThe groups \u201coperate a command and control node\u201d from Al-Shifa and have stored weapons and used tunnels underneath the hospital to hide their military operations, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One. The US also believes that the groups have held hostages under the hospital, he added, without specifying the source of the information.\nThe US said it believes militants were \u201cprepared to respond to a military operation\u201d by Israel against the facility. White House officials have said they don\u2019t want to see an aerial bombing of the facility or a firefight inside, because they don\u2019t want innocent patients to be hurt in the crossfire. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military\u2019s spokesman, called on Hamas operatives hiding under hospitals to surrender so as not to endanger patients.\nMore Signs of Hostage Deal With Hamas Cited by Broadcaster (9:27 p.m.)\nIsrael may be nearing a deal with Hamas for the return of some of the hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, Kan News says.\nNegotiators are currently discussing the names of Hamas members who would be released as part of the deal, the stages in which the agreement would be carried out and the number of days that Israel must agree to a cease-fire, the Israeli public broadcaster reported. Axios reporter Barak Ravid said that the head of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security services met with the Egyptian intelligence chief in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss efforts to free the hostages as well as Egypt\u2019s role during the war and afterward.\nIsrael Says It Seized Control of a Hamas Camp (6:59 p.m.)\nIsrael\u2019s military said it has gained control over the Shati Camp in northern Gaza. \u201cInside the camp are Hamas infrastructure and battalions, including the Shati Battalion, which took a central part in the invasion and massacre of Saturday, October 7th,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.\nCombined air and ground forces struck numerous targets on the outskirts of the Shati Camp over several days, including buildings and government institutions belonging to Hamas from which the IDF said \u201cterrorist activity was directed against the citizens of Israel and IDF forces.\u201d\nDuring the operation Hamas operatives were apprehended and transferred to Israel for interrogation, according to the Israeli statement.\nBiden Expresses Confidence Hostages Will Be Released (6:08 p.m.)\nPresident Joe Biden said he\u2019s optimistic the remaining hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 assault on Israel would be released. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking with the people involved every single day,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to happen. But I don\u2019t want to get into detail.\u201d\nThe Biden administration has been in touch with the Israeli government as well as leaders in Qatar, which houses Hamas\u2019s political office, about securing the release of the hostages.\nAsked to deliver a message of hope to the hostages, Biden said, \u201cHang in there, we\u2019re coming.\u201d\nWar Cabinet Minister Says Cease-Fire Wouldn\u2019t End War (5:16 p.m.)\nBenny Gantz, a member of Israel\u2019s war cabinet, said that \u201ceven if a cease-fire is required for the return of hostages from Gaza, there will be no stopping of the war.\u201d He said Israel is making every \u201cpolitical and military effort to bring the daughters and the sons home safely.\u201d\nGantz, a former defense minister, spoke during a visit to Israel\u2019s northern border, where there have been escalating exchanges between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, prompting the evacuation of 60,000 Israeli citizens. \u201cI see Nasrallah\u2019s conduct and ask: Has he lost touch with reality? This question should now be asked by Lebanese citizens and the Lebanese government,\u201d Gantz said, referring to Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.\nIsraeli Gas Flows to Egypt to Recover (4:39 p.m.)\nIsrael\u2019s natural gas flows to Egypt are expected to almost double and reach pre-war levels early next week, according to a person familiar with Egyptian imports, after a major offshore field resumed output on easing safety concerns.\nImports are expected to rise to 650 million cubic feet a day on Thursday, and to the normal level of 800 million early next week, from about 250 million earlier in November, the person said, asking not to be named because the information isn\u2019t public.\nHamas Media Office Says Gaza Deaths Top 11,500 (3:47 p.m.)\nThe Hamas-run media office said more than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the conflict. Medical workers at the Al-Shifa hospital have buried some of the dead in a mass grave on the facility\u2019s grounds, according to health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qedra.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nTexas Battles Wall Street in Threat to State\u2019s Muni Market\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\nWhy It\u2019s So Hard to Make Money in Space\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

The S&P 500 Index rose 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index narrowed earlier gains to end flat.\nU.S. retail sales fell in October, though by less than expected, giving some investors cause to celebrate that the U.S. economy is poised for a so-called \"soft landing\" and that the Federal Reserve is likely done raising rates.\nRecent U.S. data \"supports our view that consumer price inflation will continue to fall more rapidly than many expect, even as activity in the real economy holds up under the weight of higher rates,\" economists at Capital Economics said in a note.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.4% after data showed British inflation cooled more than forecast in October, hitting sterling and reinforcing bets the Bank of England will be cutting rates by the middle of 2024. [.EU]\n\"Good weather seems to be back. The market is starting to price in the possibility of rate cuts in the United States and also in Europe,\" said Carlo Franchini, head of institutional clients at Banca Ifigest in Milan.\n\"I think the equity rally will continue into 2024 and so will bonds of course, subject to the international picture that remains complicated with the war in Ukraine, the Middle East and trade tensions with China,\" he added.\nThe British consumer price index rose by 4.6% in the 12 months to October, slowing from September's 6.7% increase, the Office for National Statistics said. Inflation in Italy and France also receded to an annual growth rate of 1.8% and 4.5% respectively last month, according to their statistics agencies.\nOn Tuesday, data showed U.S. headline consumer prices were flat in October, against expectations for a 0.1% rise. Core CPI, at 0.2%, also came in below a forecast of 0.3%.\n\"I think the CPI number has just pushed the last person to cover their shorts,\" Naka Matsuzawa, Nomura's chief macro strategist, said on the phone from Tokyo.\nHe sees a \"more complicated\" process ahead, where stock market exuberance eventually collides with bond market expectations that an economic slowdown will drive rate cuts.\nDOLLAR SPUTTERS\nThe dollar sputtered after slumping on Tuesday following the softer U.S. inflation print. The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of peers, stood at 104.33, not far from Tuesday's two-month low of 103.98. [FRX/]\nInterest rate futures swung to price in an interest rate cut by the Fed as early as May, with a 30% chance it could come even sooner, in March.\nAfter dropping 19 basis points (bps) on Tuesday in their biggest one-day drop since March, 10-year Treasury yields bounced to 4.5333%. Ten-year German bond yields stood at 2.639%.\nSterling slid 0.72% to $1.24105 as the cooler inflation print helped the British currency reverse part of Tuesday's surge against a falling dollar. [GBP/] That helped London stocks outperform, up 0.62%. [.L] The euro inched around 0.25% lower at $1.08515.\nCHINA SUPPORT\nAdding to markets' cheer was strong industrial output and retail sales data in China and a report from Bloomberg News that China plans to provide 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) of low-cost financing to boost the housing market.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 2.85%, hitting its highest since mid-September. The Hang Seng rose nearly 4% in Hong Kong as mainland property developers rallied over 5%.\nChina's retail sales rose 7.6% in October, although that may have been flattered by the Golden Week holiday at the start of the month. Real estate remains in a deep funk, with investment in January-October down 9.3% year-on-year.\n\"It is clear that Beijing has been turning more proactive in recent weeks to help support the recovery,\" HSBC economists said in a note to clients. \"With ongoing uncertainties highlighted by the property sector, we think Beijing will continue to step up support through both fiscal and monetary means.\"\nThe weaker dollar and the expectation of more stimulus in top metals consumer China kept London copper prices, hovering near a five-week peak scaled in the previous session.

Both have denied the allegations.\nIn its previous earnings call, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said he expects Coinbase to prevail in the case.\nIn its shareholder letter, Coinbase said it generated approximately $105 million of total transaction revenue in October as the price of bitcoin - the world's largest cryptocurrency - enjoyed a bounce, but the company urged caution in extrapolating those results.\n(Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Marguerita Choy)",

Prior to the Sunday night meeting, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant\u2019s office released photographs of him surrounded by officials involved in the negotiations, including the head of the Mossad intelligence agency, the news website said. An Israeli official said that a deal isn\u2019t expected today, Ynet reported.\nHamas Chief Returns to Hostage Talks, Axios Reports (9:42 p.m.)\nHamas\u2019s leader, Yahya Sinwar, has re-engaged in talks on a hostage release, Axios reported. He\u2019s agreed in principle to increase the number of women and children to be freed to more than 50, Axios said, citing three unnamed sources.

Hagari also presented camera footage that showed that two non-Israeli hostages, a Nepali and a Thai, were taken to Shifa Hospital by gunmen on Oct. 7. An additional photograph showed that an Israeli military vehicle that was stolen during the attack was taken to Shifa Hospital.\n\u201cThese findings add to previous evidence presented regarding Hamas\u2019 use of the hospital area as infrastructure for its terrorist activities in a systematic and ongoing manner,\u201d the IDF said.\nPalestinian Death Toll Rises Above 13,000, Hamas Says (8:30 p.m.)\nThe Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 13,000, the Hamas-run government media office said.\nMore than 5,500 children are among the dead and more than 6,000 people are reported missing or trapped under rubble.

It is registered in the UK.\nIsraeli Army Says It Uncovered Fortified Tunnel Under Al-Shifa Hospital (7 p.m.)\nIsrael said it has exposed a 10-meter deep, 55-meter-long fortified tunnel underneath the Shifa hospital complex.\nThe Israel Defense Forces released a video showing a deep staircase leading to the entrance to the tunnel shaft. The tunnel leads to a blast-proof door with a firing hole. This type of door is used by Hamas to block Israeli forces from entering the command centers and the underground assets belonging to Hamas, the military said. Forces are continuing to uncover the route of the tunnel, it said.\nThe tunnel shaft was uncovered in the area of the hospital under a shed alongside a vehicle containing numerous weapons including RPGs, explosives and Kalashnikov rifles, the IDF said.\nHostage Deal is Closer, Biden Aide Says (4 p.m.)\nAn agreement for Hamas to release hostages taken during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel may be the closest yet and would require a multiday pause in the fighting in Gaza, US Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer said.\nRead more: Deal to Free Hamas Hostages Has Gotten Closer, Biden Aide Says\nUNRWA Estimates Gaza Needs 160,000 Liters of Fuel Daily (2 p.m.)\nGaza needs 160,000 liters (42,000 gallons) of fuel daily to maintain \u201ca reasonable level of humanitarian services,\u201d said Adnan Abu Hassna, United Nations Relief and Works Agency spokesman.\nThe fuel is needed for water desalination, sewage treatment plants, wells and hospitals, as well as hundreds of vehicles for UNRWA\u2019s operations.

        "text": "\nA look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.\nAsia started Monday in hesitant fashion and has turned steadily grimmer, although there is no obvious catalyst for the risk-off mood. Most regional share markets are modestly lower, as are Wall Street and European futures.\nTreasury yields are a few basis points higher, but that hasn't helped the dollar which lost ground to a broadly firmer yen. Oil prices have slipped further, while gold hit a six-month high above $2,017 an ounce - although no fundamental factors were evident behind the move.\nChina's central bank announced it would encourage financial institutions to support private companies, including with a greater tolerance for non-performing loans. The market didn't seem impressed and China's blue chips are down around 1.2%.\nThere has been a build-up of reports about official steps to support the property sector, including white-listing companies for loans, yet it's still mostly talk rather than action.\nThe official China PMI for November is due on Thursday and analysts generally look for a small pick-up and maybe a reading above 50.0.\nThe approach of the month's end could also generate some caution given the hefty gains investors are sitting on. Japan's Nikkei is up more than 8% so far in November, as is the S&P 500 - and that would be its best performance since mid-2022.\nAbout 55% of the S&P 500's component shares are trading above their 200-day moving averages, the highest share in nearly two months, according to LPL Financial.\nThe oil market faces a tense few days ahead of a meeting of OPEC+ on Nov. 30, which was postponed from Sunday as producers struggled to forge a unanimous position.\nOPEC+ sources have said that African oil producers are seeking higher caps for 2024, while media reports suggest that Saudi Arabia may extend its additional 1 million bpd voluntary production cut which is due to expire at the end of December.\nBrent was down another 0.8% today, and 8.6% for the month so far, which if sustained would be a boon both for the battle against inflation and for consumer spending power.\nThe Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation - personal consumption expenditures - is due on Thursday and forecast to dip back to 3.1%, in part due to falling gas prices. The core is seen easing to 3.5%, its lowest since mid-2021.\nData on EU inflation is also due Thursday, along with measures for Germany and Spain. Core EU inflation is forecast at 3.9%, the lowest since the middle of last year.\nIf realised, this will support market wagers of no more rate hikes, and policy easing in 2024. Futures imply around 80 basis points of cuts for both the Fed and the ECB, starting in June.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will have a chance to push back against the doves at a Fireside Chat on Friday, and there are at least seven other Fed speakers on the docket this week.\nEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has also sounded in no hurry to ease and will have another opportunity to drive home the message at the EU parliament later on Monday.\nKey developments that could influence markets on Monday:\n- ECB President Christine Lagarde at ECON Hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament\n- UK CBI distributive trades for Nov\n- U.S. new home sales, building permits for Oct\n(By Wayne Cole; Editing by Edmund Klamann)",

Employees should also avoid wearing luxury brands or revealing their compensation to third parties, the memo said.\nThe directive underscores the increasing level of self-scrutiny at Chinese financial institutions after authorities lashed out this year at bankers\u2019 \u201chedonistic\u201d lifestyles, and ordered them to comply with President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d drive. It also highlights concern among international investors that China is increasingly restricting access to transparent data and research in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nWhile Xi has vowed to make the country a more attractive place for foreign capital, his government has also been curbing the availability of some economic statistics and cracking down on consultants that help global fund managers make investment decisions in China. Among recent examples of pushback against negative commentary, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts attracted a wave of criticism in July after publishing a bearish report on Chinese banks.\nCICC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nExtra Caution\nCICC told its analysts to take extra caution when sharing views with clients outside China to reduce national security and political risks, according to the memo. They were also asked to conduct due diligence on experts they intend to invite to deal pitches and conferences, it added.\nThe Beijing-based firm is not alone in disciplining its employees as China stepped up its scrutiny over the conduct of analysts since mid-2020.\nAt least two other major investment banks have given verbal guidance to analysts over the past year barring them from making negative comments on the domestic economy or bragging about their pay, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. A Shenzhen-based brokerage discouraged its economists from discussing topics including deflation and the yuan exchange rate, one of the people said.\nThe environment has made it difficult for financial conference organizers to line up speakers who are willing to share candid views about Chinese economy and markets at financial conferences, said the people.\nChallenges Ahead\nCICC\u2019s latest document covers conduct guidelines that span from client engagement and social media use to expense reimbursement, with some parts extending to employees\u2019 family members.\nThe company has already resorted to cost cuts amid slumping profits and a leadership reshuffle. Business-related expenses will be strictly controlled, with analysts discouraged from taking taxis home after roadshows or ordering drinks at business banquets, according to the document. CICC earlier this year slashed some senior bankers\u2019 compensation for 2022 by more than 40% and scaled back travel perks.\nBankers may have to brace for more challenges ahead. China\u2019s parliament said earlier this month the financial industry\u2019s profits still have room to fall as a share of the economy, as regulators nudge banks to extend more support to the embattled property sector. On Wednesday, 19 Chinese brokerages including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley\u2019s local ventures vowed to fight corruption in their investment-bank businesses.\nXi\u2019s signature anti-graft campaign has brought down more than 100 senior financial executives and officials this year alone. And while China is striving to restore investor confidence in its feeble economy and markets, it\u2019s likely to continue with its historic crack down on information deemed harmful.\nAccording to the memo, CICC analysts should be discreet in commenting on social media, and avoid posting or sharing politically sensitive content. They\u2019re also mandated to \u201cactively\u201d participate in party-building activities, which typically involve studying the musings of the top leaders.\nHere are some other restrictions that CICC is imposing on its analysts:\nAvoid making comments that are inconsistent with government policies\nAvoid sharing unpublished views, full reports on social media WeChat, and try to keep all posts work-related\nMake sure family members abide by basic moral standards\nAvoid using full per diem allowance on meals when working overtime\n--With assistance from John Cheng, Jackie Cai, Heng Xie and Denise Wee.\n(Adds other banks\u2019 restrictions from the seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

        "text": "\n(Updates at 0925GMT)\nBy Samuel Indyk and Ankur Banerjee\nLONDON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - European shares were holding near a 5-1/2 week high on Tuesday while the dollar languished near its lowest in two-and-a-half months on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely done with interest rate hikes.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index was little changed on the day at 455.98 points. The index is up over 5% this month and on track for its biggest monthly gain since January.\nGermany's DAX was eking out a 0.15% gain, while France's CAC 40 and Britain's FTSE 100 were a touch softer.\nWith the economic calendar bare in Europe, Wall Street futures were trading lower before the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting, which investors will use to gauge which way rates are headed, and also on earnings from Nvidia, which hit a record high on Monday.\nOn Monday, Wall Street's three major stock averages rose, with Nasdaq's 1% rally leading the charge as heavyweight Microsoft hit a record high after it hired Sam Altman, who headed OpenAI until he was ousted late last week.\nStock markets have broadly rebounded in November as a flurry of data that showed U.S. inflation might be easing has spurred bets that the Fed is done with monetary tightening and rate cuts may be on the way next year.\nTraders have nearly fully priced in the likelihood that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in December, and some have started pricing in rate cuts as soon as March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\"The rapid drop in inflation, both in the U.S. and Europe, has been incredibly positive and quite substantial,\" said Hani Redha, portfolio manager, global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments.\n\"Inflation relief and then loosening of financial conditions has provided relief for risk assets.\"\nTrading is expected to be muted for much of the week, ahead of Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and a sparse data calendar for the week.\nIn Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.6% higher having earlier touched 511.05, the highest since Sept. 5. Japan's Nikkei closed lower but remained close to the 33-year high it touched on Monday. The index is up roughly 28% this year, making it the best performing stock market in Asia.\nThe MSCI World Equity Index gained 0.1%.\nTreasury yields were lower in the wake of solid bidding in the $16-billion sale of 20-year Treasury bonds on Monday that suggested the market still anticipates inflation will decelerate and the Fed will cut rates next year.\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 1 basis point to 4.41%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was down 3 basis points to 4.547%.\nLower yields kept the dollar on the back foot, with the dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major currencies, down 0.1% at 103.30, having touched near three-month low of 103.17 earlier in the session.\nThe Japanese yen strengthened to 147.155 per dollar, lifting further away from the one-year low of 151.92 it touched last week.\nChina's yuan rose to its highest since July in both the offshore and onshore markets, gaining from a much stronger midpoint fixing.\n\"A softer dollar environment has seen Chinese authorities turn the screws on those with short renminbi positions,\" ING strategist Chris Turner said.\n\"For the short term, we think these moves can lift the Asian FX bloc in general and add to the current soft dollar environment.\"\nThe Australian dollar, often seen as a barometer of risk appetite, touched a more than three-month high of $0.6587 earlier in the session.\nThe head of Australia's central bank said on Tuesday inflation will remain a crucial challenge over the next one to two years, in comments made two weeks after policymakers raised interest rates to a 12-year high earlier to tame high prices.\nOil prices eased, reversing the previous day's rally. U.S. crude eased 1% to $77.03 per barrel and Brent was at $81.54, down a similar amount.\nSpot gold rose to $1977.60 per ounce, its highest level in more than two weeks, aided by the weaker dollar.\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Bernadette Baum)",

The net result is that the yen was little changed on the day, leaving it down some 13% this year, the worst performance of any Group-of-10 currency.\n\u201cI suspect it is the market doing it to itself, with the fear of BOJ intervention,\u201d according to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global. Approximately $1.25 billion in yen options expire Monday at the 152 per dollar level, likely contributing to any sudden movements in the currency around the key level, he said.\nChandler likened it to an episode in early October, when the currency saw a similarly sudden bout of strength in New York trading, triggering a debate over whether Japan had intervened.\nThe currency traded around the 151.70 level early Tuesday in Asia.\nThe yen has been mired in a trend of sustained depreciation, driven by a persistently wide interest-rate gap between Japan and the US. The Bank of Japan further loosened its grip on government bond yields on Oct. 31, but stuck with its negative interest-rate policy, a decision that underwhelmed traders looking for a trigger to drive a sustained yen rebound.\nThe Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is saying it may lift rates again after hiking them to the highest in more than two decades, a dynamic that has fueled broad dollar strength this year.\nThe yen\u2019s decline this year has fed into an inflation rate that has been above the BOJ\u2019s 2% target since April 2022, putting pressure on it to normalize monetary policy.\nLow volatility in foreign-exchange rates has also encouraged so-called carry trades, a strategy that involves raising money in yen and selling it for higher-yielding currencies, another factor that\u2019s weighed on the Japanese currency.\nBrief Rally\nThe sharp, brief rally in the yen began around 10 a.m. New York time.\nJapan\u2019s finance minister, Shunichi Suzuki, said Monday that policymakers would respond as needed to sudden moves in the yen. The nation\u2019s top currency official, Masato Kanda, said on Nov. 1 that authorities were \u201con standby,\u201d when asked if he was prepared to intervene in the currency market or take other measures to curb the yen\u2019s slide.\n\u201cIn our view, this is again just reflective of a market that is cautious about potential BOJ intervention as opposed to actual involvement,\u201d said Simon Harvey, head of foreign-exchange analysis at Monex Europe.\n\u201cWe saw similar sharp retracements last month around the 150 handle, with the BoJ official intervention data showing no ultimate involvement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe move today looks similar in terms of volume and range to these instances in early October.\u201d\n--With assistance from George Lei, Robert Fullem and Lisa Wolfson.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

        "text": "\nBy David Lawder\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Trade ministers from members of an Asian free trade pact abandoned by the United States affirmed on Wednesday a desire for more countries to join the bloc if they can meet its standards.\nThe officials from the 12 Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) countries met in San Francisco just after trade negotiations for the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) initiative ground to a halt without an agreement this week.\nThe lack of an IPEF trade deal is a setback for the Biden administration. It had aimed to showcase the initiative during this week's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco as a symbol of its economic re-engagement in Asia, providing countries a counterweight to China's growing clout in the region.\nThe CPTPP is the successor to the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal, from which former President Donald Trump withdrew as soon as he took office in 2017.\nThe CPTPP meeting on the sidelines of the APEC leaders' summit was the first ministerial to include new member Britain, which signed up to the trade bloc in July.\nIn a joint statement posted on the UK trade ministry website, the ministers \"reaffirmed that the CPTPP is open to accession requests by economies that are ready to meet the high standards of the agreement and have a demonstrated pattern of complying with trade commitments.\"\nThe statement made no mention of China's application to join the bloc, nor applications by Taiwan, Costa Rica and Ecuador.\nIt said accession decisions are dependent upon consensus, and since July, they have been \"gathering information on whether aspirant economies can meet CPTPP\u2019s high standards.\"\nInformation collected to date \"will not prejudge any process, outcome, decision and/or actions to be taken by CPTPP members,\" it said, adding that the bloc would apply lessons learned in the UK accession.\nThe current CPTPP members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Most overlap with both APEC and the IPEF initiative.\n(Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

In May, it paused mining at Balama after oversupply hit prices.\nThe export controls could mean that automakers and suppliers of battery materials will have to accelerate their search for alterative sources of the mineral.\nSyrah said that, based on feedback from its customers and analysts, buyers are looking to stockpile graphite to reduce the risk of near-term supply disruptions ahead of the ban, and ahead of China's winter when it tends to produce less natural graphite.\n\"Any disruption or reduction in China anode precursor or AAM export supply without replacement supply would impact battery production outside China,\" it said.\nUncertainties regarding the impact of the controls on Chinese supply is expected to continue into 2024, Syrah added, but for now, it does not expect any near-term \"meaningful\" impact demand from China on its Mozambique project.\n\"Although the impacts of implementation are not yet known, the announced graphite export controls in China are increasing Government and private sector attention on the strategic importance of Syrah as a unique ex-China natural graphite and AAM supplier in the battery supply chain,\" the company said in a statement.\nSyrah's comments come as Australian government officials visit the United States to shore up cooperation over critical minerals.\nShares in Syrah spiked to 43% to A$0.95 a share on Friday when the export bans were announced before trading at $0.66 cents on Thursday.\nThe U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) last month approved a loan of up to $150 million for Syrah's Mozambique operations.\n(Reporting by Roushni Nair in Bengaluru and Melanie Burton in Melbourne, editing by Miral Fahmy)",

        "text": "\nNov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose moderately in October, while the annual increase in inflation was the smallest since early 2021, signs of cooling demand that could further strengthen expectations that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking campaign was over.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.7% gain in September, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast spending gaining 0.2%.\nThe moderation in consumer spending followed a brisk growth pace in the third quarter and reflects the impact of higher borrowing costs and depleted excess savings among low-income households. Though wages remain elevated, the pace of increase has slowed from earlier in the year as the labor market eases.\nMillions of Americans resumed student loan repayments last month, which could crimp spending next year.\nFears that the economy could slide into recession in early 2024 could see households reluctant to spend and instead build their savings. So far, the economy has defied predictions of a recession, growing at a robust 5.2% annualized pace in the third quarter, the fastest in nearly two years.\nGrowth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 2% rate. Most economists expect the economy to settle into a period of very slow growth, and avoid an outright recession.\nInflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was unchanged in October after climbing 0.4% in September.\nIn the 12 months through October, the PCE price index increased 3.0%. That was the smallest year-on-year gain since March 2021 and followed a 3.4% advance in September.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index gained 0.2% last month, after rising 0.3% in September. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% on a sustainable basis are needed to bring inflation back to the U.S. central bank's 2% target, according to economists.\nThe so-called core PCE price index advanced 3.5% on a year-on-year basis in October, after increasing 3.7% in September.\nThe Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for monetary policy.\nSubsiding demand and inflation pressures have raised optimism that the Fed is probably done raising interest rates this cycle, with financial markets even anticipating a rate cut in mid-2024. Since March 2022, the central bank has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range.\nEasing labor market conditions were reinforced by a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended Nov. 25. Economists had forecast 226,000 claims for the latest week.\nLast week's claims data included the Thanksgiving Holiday. Claims tend to be volatile around holidays. Still, the labor market is cooling in tandem with overall demand in the economy.\nThe number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 86,000 to 1.927 million during the week ending Nov. 18, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims resumed their upward trend, which started since mid-September, after a brief interruption in the prior week.\nA combination of loosening labor market conditions and difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations following an unprecedented surge in applications for jobless benefits early in the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed continuing claims higher.

        "text": "\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The United Kingdom is hosting the AI Safety Summit, bringing politicians, computer scientists and tech executives to a site chosen for its symbolism: Bletchley Park, synonymous with codebreaking and the birth of computing.\nDuring World War II, a group of mathematicians, cryptographers, crossword puzzlers, chess masters and other experts gathered at the Victorian country house 45 miles (72 kilometers) northwest of London to wage a secret war against Nazi Germany. Their goal: cracking Adolf Hitler\u2019s supposedly unbreakable codes.\nBletchley Park\u2019s most famous feat was outwitting Germany\u2019s Enigma encryption machine, which produced a constantly changing cipher and was widely considered unbreakable. To crack it, mathematician Alan Turing \u2014 building on work done by Polish codebreakers \u2014 developed the \u201cTuring bombe,\u201d a forerunner of modern computers.\nDeciphered Enigma messages revealed details of the movements of Germany\u2019s U-boat fleets and provided crucial information for the North African desert campaign and the Allied invasion of France. Some historians say cracking the code helped shorten the war by up to two years.\nHistorian Chris Smith, author of \u201cThe Hidden History of Bletchley Park,\u201d said it is impossible to prove the extent to which the work at Bletchley Park shortened the war, but it undoubtedly sped up the development of computing.\nBletchley Park's wartime scientists developed Colossus, the first programmable digital computer, to crack the Lorenz cipher that Hitler used to communicate with his generals.\n\u201cThey built, effectively, one of the early generations of computers from basically nothing,\u201d Smith said, exhibiting a \u201ctechnological optimism\u201d that's a striking feature of wartime Bletchley Park.\nNo wonder current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s government finds it inspiring.\nSmith, a lecturer in history at Coventry University, said a mythology has developed around Bletchley Park, as a playground for Turing and other eccentric scientists, that oversimplifies its true contribution.\n\u201cIt fits into this idea that a group of boffins with a bit of wool and some yards of wire and some bits and bobs can win the war,\u201d he said.\nIn fact, almost 10,000 people worked at Bletchley Park during the war, three-quarters of them women, overflowing from the mansion into newly built brick and concrete blocks and smaller wooden structures known as huts.\n\u201cThe way to imagine Bletchley Park is a massive civil service bureaucracy,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a factory. \u2026 Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. It\u2019s always going.\u201d\nWhen peace came, the codebreakers returned to civilian life, sworn to secrecy about their wartime work. It was not until the 1970s that the work at Bletchley Park became widely known in Britain.\nThe site opened as a museum in 1994, after local historians banded together to prevent it from being bulldozed to build a supermarket. It was restored to its 1940s appearance, complete with manual typewriters, rotary phones and enamel mugs \u2014 including one chained to a radiator in Hut 8, where Turing led the Enigma team.\nAfter the war, Turing continued to work on computing and developed the \u201cTuring test\u201d to measure when artificial intelligence becomes indistinguishable from a human \u2014 a test some say modern-day AI has already passed.\nIn 1952 he was convicted of \u201cgross indecency\u201d over his relationship with another man, stripped of his security clearance and forced to take estrogen to neutralize his sex drive. He died at 41 in 1954 after eating an apple laced with cyanide.\nTuring received a posthumous apology from the British government in 2009 and a royal pardon in 2013. The 2014 film \u201cThe Imitation Game,\u201d starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, cemented his national hero status.\nTuring is commemorated by statues and plaques across the U.K. One of the most prestigious honors in computing, the $1 million Turing Prize, is named after him. His face even adorns the Bank of England\u2019s 50-pound note.",

Markets climbed in recent days on hints from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that policymakers may be done raising interest rates and on signs of a slowing economy.\nSummers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV, also renewed his criticism of US debt issuance management in recent years \u2014 a topic newly in focus thanks to criticism of the Treasury from billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller.\nRelated: Druckenmiller Digs In on Criticism of Yellen, Disputes Her Math\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our debts have been well managed over the last few years,\u201d Summers said, pointing especially to the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing program. Through QE, the Fed created bank reserves to purchase what were at the time low-yielding, longer dated Treasuries. Today, the Fed now pays much higher interest on those reserves than the income it receives from its bond portfolio.\nFor federal authorities, they effectively swapped longer-term debt for shorter-term obligations. Summers said if a household that shifted into a floating-rate mortgage in 2021 when rates were low \u201cwould be regretting its decisions today.\u201d\nA knock-on effect from the Fed\u2019s policy is that it now no longer transfers about $100 billion a year in income to the Treasury \u2014 a shift that has worsened the fiscal deficit.\n\u201cWe probably need to rethink a lot of our thinking on debt management,\u201d Summers said.\nStocks and bonds added to their gains Friday in the wake of an October jobs report that showed weaker payroll gains than anticipated, along with a step down in wage increases and a tick up in the unemployment rate. Summers said the data weren\u2019t conclusive, however.\nRead More: US Jobs Data Show Broad Cooling After Run of Surprise Strength\n\u201cThe labor market\u2019s not quite red hot the way that it was a few months ago,\u201d said Summers. \u201cBut whether it\u2019s in a place that\u2019s consistent with sustainable inflation at 2% I think that\u2019s still very much in doubt.\u201d\nSummers also criticized Fed policymakers for specifying that the run-up in longer-term Treasury yields seen before this week effectively lessened the argument for them to raise rates again. Powell said last month that the rise in yields \u201cat the margin\u201d could lessen the need for more Fed action.\n\u201cI am not confident of a central element in the Fed\u2019s thinking,\u201d Summers said. \u201cWhich is, they can regard higher long term rates as some kind of contractionary impulse to which the right response is for their policy to be easy.\u201d\nIf yields are higher thanks to government borrowing or stronger investment, \u201cthat is not the basis\u201d for an easier stance, he said. If they\u2019re higher because of the term premium \u2014 where investors demand extra to buy longer-term securities instead of just rolling over shorter-dated ones \u2014 it\u2019s not clear how big the impact of that phenomenon is on investment decisions, Summers said.\nThe former Treasury chief also blasted House Republican policymakers for funding a package of aid to Israel by reducing the budget of the IRS. That \u201cfoolish\u201d approach would simply raise the deficit as less revenue is collected, he said. The White House threatened to veto the bill, which is also opposed in the Senate.\nRead More: House Passes Israel Aid Tied to IRS Cuts, Triggering Biden Clash\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World\nOnline Gambling Has Millions of Young Africans Battling Addiction\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nShipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Mondino, Milei\u2019s incoming foreign minister, met in Brasilia with Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira, to whom she handed the invitation for Lula.\n\u201cThe main message is that we are brotherly countries, and we will continue to be so,\u201d Mondino told reporters after the meeting. \u201cWe have to work hard together to make both countries grow.\u201d\nRead More: Caputo Tells Bankers Argentina Dollarization Is Medium-Term Goal\nMilei is softening his aggressive rhetoric toward trading partners such as China and Brazil after calling Lula a \u201ccommunist with whom he wouldn\u2019t deal\u201d in an interview with Bloomberg News. After winning election, Milei told local TV that Lula would \u201cbe welcome\u201d to attend the inauguration.

The partnership will continue better and as quickly as we can.\u201d\nLula put relations with Argentina on hold to understand the incoming Milei administration\u2019s plans for its relationship with what is its largest trading partner in South America.\nMondino, speaking alongside Vieira, said that trade agreements should be signed between the Mercosur bloc and the European Union \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and, eventually, with other countries such as Singapore.\nThe two did not discuss the BRICS grouping, Mondino said in response to a reporter\u2019s question, adding that she doesn\u2019t know what advantages the bloc could offer Argentina. \u201cWe already work with practically all the countries\u201d in the group, Mondino said.\nMilei will be joined on the US trip by sister Karina Milei, potential cabinet chief Nicolas Posse and adviser Santiago Caputo.\n(Updates with trip details in second paragraph, names of delegation members in final paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nScientists and Farmers Race to Save the World\u2019s Banana Supply\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nBy Lawrence White and Selena Li\nLONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) -StanChart shares fell 12% in London on Thursday before trading was briefly halted, after it announced its profit unexpectedly plunged by a third due to a nearly $1 billion combined hit from its exposure to China's real estate and banking sectors.\nThe bank said pre-tax profit dropped 33% in the third quarter, far worse than analyst estimates, as it booked a $700 million impairment from its stake in China Bohai Bank, and a $186 million charge from Chinese commercial real estate.\nBy 0919 GMT, Standard Chartered shares were down 10.5%, set for their largest one-day fall since March last year, when Russia invaded Ukraine.\nThe U.K.-headquartered bank, which earns most of its revenue in Asia, booked July-September statutory pretax profit of $633 million. That compared with $996 million a year earlier and the $1.41 billion average of analyst estimates.\nThe hefty loss in China, where StanChart has based much of its expansion effort, underlines the challenge it faces to improve returns via exposure to the world's second-largest economy at a time of slowing growth and widening losses on loans.\nStanChart said the hit on its 16% stake in China Bohai, a lender in the eastern coastal city of Tianjin in which it invested more than a decade ago, was due to lower forecast interest rates and decreased lending margins.\nBohai booked a 17.8% fall in January-June net interest income, leading to a nearly 7% decline in its overall profit, according to company filings.\n\"We took a couple of impairment charges a year and a bit ago, and we have taken the extra impairment charge as you can see today,\" Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told reporters.\n\"That is reflective of the fact that particularly its own net interest margin has been weaker,\" he said.\nA raft of government easing measures has done little to allay China's economic fragility as a crisis in its property market deepens with high-profile debt-repayment defaults.\nStanChart's Chinese real estate exposure totalled $2.7 billion as of the end of September, down $200 million from the previous quarter.\nShares in rival HSBC, which similarly has exposure to Chinese real estate and to the bank sector via its stake in Bank of Communications, were down only 2% on Thursday as investors saw limited read-across between the two.\nStanChart, which has been the subject of repeated takeover speculation in the last decade, saw renewed interest earlier this year after First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) in January said it had considered but abandoned a bid.\nStanChart has recently had \"no contact\" with FAB, Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told reporters on a conference call on Thursday.\n'SOLID PERFORMANCE' IN OTHER BUSINESS\nStanChart said it is confident of hitting its return-on-tangible-equity targets of 10% this year and 11% in 2024, but downgraded some other performance forecasts for the year.\n\"Investors were expecting a clean set of third quarter numbers, and we do not have that today,\" said Jefferies analyst Joe Dickerson.\nThe \"silver lining\" for investors was the bank's underlying business performance - excluding impairment charges - remained solid, Dickerson said in a note to clients.\nNet interest margin, a measure of return on lending, will now \"approach\" 1.7 percentage points rather than be \"around\" that level, StanChart said.\nRate-sensitive businesses received a boost, with income from transaction banking - the bulk in cash management services - increasing 42% and retail products reporting 17% growth.\nIn the financial markets trading division, income fell 8% as reduced market volatility curbed client appetite for trading.\n(Reporting by Selena Li and Lawrence White; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Christina Fincher)",

Since the last refunding announcement in August, borrowing rates have spiralled to their highest since 2006-07.\nThe dollar index was last down 0.14% at 106.45, hurt by a small pick up in the euro, which gained 0.17% to $1.05835.\nThe common currency has had a quiet October, and still is not far off a 10-month low of $1.0448 hit at the start of the month.\nIn the mix in Europe on Monday was cooling German state inflation data, which pointed to slowing headline inflation in the euro zone's largest economy, and a separate release showing German gross domestic product fell by 0.1% quarter on quarter, though this was above expectations.\nCENTRAL BANKS\nOf the three central bank meetings, the BOJ's is attracting the most scrutiny from investors given heightened speculation over a policy tweak.\nA recent surge in global interest rates has heightened pressure on the BOJ to change its bond yield control policy, as speculation mounts that the central bank could hike its existing yield cap at this week's meeting.\nThe Fed and BoE are both expected to keep rates steady so, barring any surprises, the focus will be more around the message the policymakers communicate.\nThe yen was little changed at 149.75 per dollar, getting a slight reprieve after having struck a one-year trough of 150.78 per dollar last week.\nThe pound was steady at $1.2125.\nU.S. nonfarm payrolls data on Friday will also be important for expectations of the Fed's rate hike path.\n\"October\u2019s jobs report takes on added importance on the back of September\u2019s dramatic outcome, when net of revisions the cumulative payroll gain was 455k. The report will help to determine whether September was more signal or noise,\" said BNP Paribas analysts in a note.\n\"We expect a 190k payroll print - still sturdy but not compellingly pointing to reacceleration. However, another firm print would likely see long-end yields increase further as the market reassess the degree of policy-rate restriction and inflation expectations rise,\" the note added.\n(Reporting by Rae Wee in Singapore and Alun John in London; Editing by Miral Fahmy and Mark Potter)",

The mine, owned by China's MMG Ltd, began operations in 2016 and is among the largest copper producers in Peru, the world's No. 2 producer of the metal.\nThe union had already kicked off a strike on Sunday, which is set to end Tuesday, over the profit sharing.\nThe miner, as part of its contract with workers, is to share some profits every year with employees.\nHowever, the mine \"had already said that there wouldn't be any profit sharing this year,\" Ramos said. \"So they're going to have to see how to pay the workers. By contract they were supposed to have given us part of that payment in November.\"\nLas Bambas has pumped out around 221,160 metric tons of copper from January to September this year, a 21.7% boost from the year before, according to sources at the mining ministry.\nThe mine's production has steadily increased after having to freeze operations at the beginning of the year due to roadblocks by anti-government protesters following December's ouster of President Pedro Castillo.\nA source close to the mine said the company respects labor rights \"and works hard to ensure a safe working environment for its workers,\" noting the labor ministry had declared the current strike \"inadmissible\".\nThe union, which represents more than 1,000 workers, is currently registering the strike set for Nov. 28 with the labor ministry, Ramos said.\n(Reporting by Marco Aquino, Writing by Isabel Woodford and Kylie Madry, Editing by Louise Heavens, Kirsten Donovan and David Gregorio)",

The top-spending hour is usually from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m., according to the company\u2019s analysts.\nMonday\u2019s spending will cap off a record five days of online purchasing: Black Friday topped projections at $9.8 billion, up 7.5% from a year earlier. Thanksgiving spending of $5.6 billion was up 5.5%, according to figures released early Monday from Adobe. Adobe expects total spending for the Thursday-Monday period, which they call Cyber Week, to be as much as $38.1 billion, an increase from its earlier forecast of $37.2 billion.\nFlexible spending options, including buy-now-pay-later features online, have helped shoppers stretch budgets otherwise battered by inflation. Consumers used such promotions to spend $7.3 billion from Nov. 1 to Nov. 26, up 14% from a year ago, according to Adobe, underscoring how credit is helping retailers spur spending.\nThe adjusted Cyber Monday forecast follows a robust Thanksgiving weekend for US retailers, which generate much of their sales and profits during the annual shopathon. US shoppers spent $10.3 billion online Saturday and Sunday, an increase of 7.7% from a year earlier. Analysts are closely watching holiday shopping this year to assess the American consumer\u2019s staying power as pandemic-era savings dwindle and interest rates remain at a 20-plus-year high.\n\u201cAn uncertain demand environment pushed retailers to deliver big discounts this season, while also fortifying their e-commerce services with flexible payment methods,\u201d said Vivek Pandya, a lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. \u201cConsumers have taken note and spent at record rates during the big shopping days, despite dealing with rising costs in other parts of their lives.\u201d\nThe S&P 500\u2019s Retailing Index rose less than 1% on Monday. Shopify Inc. shares surged as much as 5.2% after the Ottawa-based e-commerce company said merchants set a Black Friday record with a combined $4.1 billion in sales.\nAverage transaction sizes for most large retailers, including Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., were down slightly in the first eight hours of Cyber Monday compared with a year earlier, according to data compiled by researcher Attain. The exceptions were Best Buy, Temu and eBay, which all saw average transaction sizes increase in early shopping.\nThe data show shoppers are resilient and curious about shopping on new platforms such as Temu and Shein, said Brian Mandelbaum, chief executive officer of Chicago-based Attain, which gleans insights from credit-card transactions. \u201cThese emerging platforms like Temu are attracting new consumers and have an opportunity to chip away at market share from established giants like Amazon,\u201d he said.\nBig sale days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday have been gradually losing their cachet as shoppers spread their spending over longer periods. Still, with inflation-stung consumers watching their budgets, retailers increasingly count on these events to see what products shoppers are clicking on \u2014 then targeting them with bigger discounts as the clock counts down to Christmas.\nMost retailers recycled their same Black Friday discounts on Cyber Monday, meaning shoppers who waited aren\u2019t getting a better deal than if they\u2019d made the purchase a few days ago, said Kristin McGrath, an editor at RetailMeNot, which monitors deals.\n\u201cA lot of people ask if they should wait for Cyber Monday, but this year we\u2019re just seeing a lot of the same Black Friday deals across the board,\u201d she said.\nHot items included Barbie dolls, Lego sets, the Nintendo Switch, headphones and smartwatches, according to Adobe, which tracks 1 trillion visits to retail websites and monitors sales of more than 100 million products. Electronics and toys were among the most heavily discounted items, according to Adobe.\nTotal online sales for November and December combined is set to reach $228 billion, up 4.8% from last year, according to the firm.\n(Updated with Cyber Monday sales figures in the second paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

        "text": "\n(In paragraph 23, changes \"violence\" to \"finance\")\nBy Jack Queen and Luc Cohen\nNEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Donald Trump was fined $10,000 on Wednesday after the New York judge overseeing his civil fraud trial said the former U.S. president for a second time violated a gag order barring him from disparaging court staff.\nJustice Arthur Engoron had imposed the order on Oct. 3 after Trump shared on social media a photo of the judge's top clerk posing with U.S. Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, and falsely called her Schumer's \"girlfriend.\"\nDuring a break on Wednesday in the case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James concerning Trump's business practices, Trump told reporters in a hallway, \"This judge is a very partisan judge, with a person who's very partisan sitting alongside of him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is.\"\nEngoron, surmising that Trump was referencing his clerk, called the comments a \"blatant\" gag order violation.\nTrump's hallway remarks came as Michael Cohen, his onetime lawyer and fixer, testified for a second day against him.\nBefore being fined, Trump briefly took the witness stand and told Engoron he was referring to \"you and Cohen\" during his remarks. The judge rejected the idea, echoed by Trump's lawyer Christopher Kise, that the \"partisan\" person Trump mentioned was Cohen.\n\"The idea that that statement would refer to the witness, that doesn't make sense to me,\" Engoron said. \"Don't do it again or it will be worse.\"\nTrump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the 2024 U.S. election, walked out of the courtroom after being fined.\nOn Oct. 20, Engoron fined Trump $5,000 after finding he had not taken down a post disparaging the clerk, warning that future transgressions could bring \"far more severe\" sanctions including jail. In originally imposing the gag order, Engoron said comments against his staff were \"unacceptable, inappropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.\"\nEngoron's clerk has sat next to the judge during the trial, standard practice in a New York state court.\nAlina Habba, one of Trump's lawyers, told Engoron she saw the clerk appear to roll her eyes during Cohen's testimony, and that this was \"completely inappropriate.\"\nCOHEN DEFENDS CREDIBILITY\nThe trial concerns allegations that Trump and his family business, the Trump Organization, unlawfully manipulated asset values and his net worth to dupe lenders and insurers. The case could break up Trump's business empire.\nCohen's two days of testimony marked his first face-to-face encounters with Trump in five years. Trump \"arbitrarily\" inflated the value of real estate assets to secure favorable insurance premiums, Cohen testified on Tuesday.\nSince cutting ties and becoming one of Trump's fiercest critics, Cohen has written two books and created a political podcast.\nCross-examined by Habba on Wednesday, Cohen acknowledged having a financial incentive to criticize Trump, but defended his credibility. He rejected Habba's contention that he has \"made a career\" of attacking Trump and embellishing criticism for personal gain.\n\"The more outrageous your stories are about President Trump, the more money you make,\" Habba said. \"Is that accurate, Mr. Cohen?\"\n\"No,\" Cohen responded.\nA lawyer for Trump's adult son Eric Trump - also a defendant in the case - asked Engoron to immediately enter a verdict in the defense's favor based on what he called Cohen's contradictory testimony.\nCohen said on Tuesday Trump told him to inflate his asset values but said during 2019 congressional testimony he did not recall whether he received such a directive.\nEngoron denied the request, saying it would be \"absurd\" to rule in the defense's favor midway through trial based on an \"equivocal\" statement by one witness.\n\"There's enough evidence to fill this courtroom,\" Engoron said.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in the case. Trump separately has pleaded not guilty in four criminal cases this year.\nCohen's testimony could bolster the attorney general's case though his admitted record of deceit could undermine his credibility before Engoron, who alone will decide the outcome of the bench trial. In 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to tax fraud, campaign finance violations and perjury and was sentenced to three years in prison.\nBefore the trial's Oct. 2 start, Engoron found that Trump fraudulently inflated his net worth, and ordered that companies that control crown jewels of his real estate portfolio, including Trump Tower in Manhattan, be dissolved. That ruling is on hold while Trump appeals.\nThe trial largely concerns damages. James wants at least $250 million in fines, a permanent ban against Trump and sons Eric and Donald Jr. from running businesses in New York and a five-year commercial real estate ban against Trump and the Trump Organization.\n(Reporting by Jack Queen and Luc Cohen in New York; Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder)",

Its analysis includes companies like Hormel Foods Corp. and China\u2019s New Hope Liuhe Co., which supply household names like Walmart Inc. and McDonald\u2019s Corp.\nThe food industry\u2019s climate footprint is immense, accounting for about a third of global greenhouse gases. Livestock, which releases potent methane, makes up 14.5% of worldwide emissions. The Science-Based Targets initiative, a UN-backed agency that evaluates companies\u2019 net-zero goals, recommends that the food and agriculture sector cuts emissions by 3% a year between 2020 and 2030.\n\u201cThe sector is just not on track,\u201d said Thalia Vounaki, senior manager for research and engagements at FAIRR.\nRead more: Companies Aren\u2019t Using Quick Fix to Reduce Methane Emissions\nThat underlines the need to focus on food and agriculture as world leaders gear up for the upcoming COP28 summit in Dubai later this month, FAIRR said in its report.

But overall there are varying levels of climate commitments and disclosure, it said. Almost two-thirds of the companies it analyzed didn\u2019t disclose so-called Scope 3 emissions, which include those that occur indirectly along a company\u2019s value chain.

Maybe the track will be good, maybe it\u2019ll be bad. I think don\u2019t knock it until you try it.\u201d\nAnd he defended F1 and Liberty's direction. The United States Grand Prix was the lone F1 stop in America from 2012 through 2021. The Miami Grand Prix was added in 2022 and now Las Vegas makes its debut down the Strip after two races in 1981 and 1982 that utilized a parking lot at Caesars Palace.\n\u201cI hear there\u2019s a lot of people complaining about the direction that Stefano and Liberty have been going, but I think they\u2019ve been doing an amazing job,\u201d Hamilton added. \u201cThis sport is growing massively. We\u2019ve just got to think about the impact that we have in these different places. It\u2019s not just a circus that comes here and then we leave. We should look at how we can positively impact the community here and particularly like the kids.\u201d\nVerstappen conceded he's aware of what Liberty Media is trying to do with F1, even if he prefers the focus to be on racing.\n\u201cYou can look at it two ways, business side or sport side, so I of course understand their side of it as well, but I\u2019m just voicing my opinion on the performance side of things,\" he said. \u201cWe are not stakeholders, so we just go with it. I mean, they decide what they do, right? If someone really wants to go into this direction, that you want a lot more show attached to the kind of program, I guess we have to deal with that. Let\u2019s see how long fans also like this.\u201d\nTicket prices and hotel rates had plummeted for the event last week, and although tickets still remain directly from the Las Vegas Grand Prix site, brokers are now reporting there's been a last-minute uptick in interest. Gametime said the top-priced seats are listed at $7,109 for the weekend, up from $4,613 one week ago.\nStubhub, meanwhile, said the Las Vegas Grand Prix is the best-selling F1 race of the year and ranks among the top 10 highest-selling sporting events of the entire year globally on the secondary site. Stubhub said half of the tickets sold have been since F1's Nov. 5 race in Brazil, and that 30% of tickets purchased are from California-based buyers.\nIt's the most expensive race to attend on this year's 24-event calendar.\nMercedes head Toto Wolff said he's viewing this week from two different lenses. He said \u201cthe team principal in me dreads the race\u201d because of so many unknowns of the track and the expected temperatures don't suit the Mercedes' performance.\n\u201cThe team principal, that kind of narrow-minded racing person, says it is going to be very difficult,\u201d Wolff said.\nBut as a stakeholder in F1's success, he appreciates the attempt to race in Las Vegas.\n\u201cIf we provide great racing, it's going to be entertaining,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cAnd being able to do this in the middle of Las Vegas, on the Strip, was unthinkable many, many years ago. I hope we become a fixture among the big events that happen every year in Las Vegas and we provide great racing.\u201d\nRACE FOR SECOND\nMercedes has all but given up on Hamilton's chance to catch Sergio Perez for second in the final drivers' standings.\nWith two races remaining, Hamilton trails Perez by 32 points in the standings. A race winner receives 25 points, and only the top 10 finishers are awarded points.\nHamilton acknowledged its a longshot at this point, especially considering beating Verstappen for a race win seems impossible right now.\n\u201cHe would have to have two disasters and I would have to be second, basically,\u201d Hamilton said of Perez. \u201cBut for me, honestly it really doesn\u2019t make any difference if I\u2019m second or third. I think we still had an amazing year given the car that we\u2019ve had. We never thought that we would be fighting for second in the constructors\u2019 and knocking on the door of the most dominant car, probably, of our era.\u201d\nWolff also said it would take Perez failing to finish both Saturday night and in next week's season finale in Abu Dhabi.\n\u201cIt is very difficult. If Perez DNF's, then we have a shot,\u201d Wolff said. He instead said the team is fighting hard to maintain its 20-point lead over Ferrari for second in the constructors' championship.\n\u201cI think it would be a testament considering we had an uncompetitive car that will still be able to finish second,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cWe've been always there, not where we wish to be, but second in the world championship is not something to be ashamed of.\u201d\nJET LAG\nF1 is in a brutal final stretch of the season that saw the series race three consecutive weeks in Texas, Mexico City and Brazil, with one week off before Las Vegas. F1 then goes directly to Abu Dhabi for next Sunday's season finale.\nCompounding the issue is that all on-track activity in Las Vegas is late at night, with qualifying scheduled for midnight local time on Friday and the race itself goes off at 10 p.m.\n\"It feels like I've been jet-lagged for a month and a half,\u201d said Haas driver Kevin Magnussen, who said he'd been awake for 24 consecutive hours as he's adapting to Las Vegas times and preparing for a late race.\nAdded Perez of Red Bull: \u201cI\u2019m finding it a bit crazy to stay awake so long at night. It\u2019s quite a challenge, actually, to stay awake for so long.\u201d\nIt was another one of Verstappen's complaints, as well.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense,\u201d he said of leaving Las Vegas for Abu Dhabi, where there is a 12-hour time change. \u201cI don\u2019t really get that. This is very tiring. Also the end of the season that, we have to do this.\u201d\nOF NOTE\nThe Sphere will not be dimmed while drivers are on track, but F1 and the FIA asked that yellow, red and blue not be used on the massive LED screen in an effort to not distract the drivers.\nVerstappen didn't think the Sphere would be a problem, anyway, and hoped that the images shown during the race would be entertaining. But he balked when told that driver images would be projected, including his.\n\u201cNo, that definitely is a distraction for me,\" he said. \"I might shunt in the wall, so let's not do that.\u201d\n___\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",

        "text": "\nBy Arriana McLymore\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Generative AI will be Amazon's secret weapon this holiday season, leveraging data from its more than 160 million Prime subscribers to improve ad targeting and allowing merchants to produce promotions quickly.\nApart from fast shipping and the usual discounts for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the company is betting that targeted ads, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), will draw more shoppers and advertisers to its platform.\nAmazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said on a call Thursday with analysts that machine learning is helping the company present more relevant ads to shoppers.\n\"When (advertisers) have to think about budget decisions, they're going to choose (ads) that have large volume and perform better. I think both of those are real advantages in our advertising area right now,\" Jassy said.\nThis week, the company said it is using generative AI to create better product images for advertisers, a move to direct more eyes to third-party sellers' products. The tool generates background pictures for merchandise based on product details.\nAmazon is not the first online retailer to deploy AI for advertising, but given its scale, Amazon's use is expected to increase adoption of the strategy.\nThe main benefit of generative AI will be its \"ability to show dozens, if not thousands, of variations of your ad personalized to the user,\" said Swiftly Chief Revenue Officer Andy Friedland, a former ad executive at Amazon. Swiftly is a retail technology platform.\nHe said creating different ads for various audiences can be expensive and expects Amazon's AI tools to save money for advertisers.\nBrendan Witcher, a principal analyst at Forrester, said that Amazon's generative AI ad tool will be \"good for attracting and keeping a segment of third-party sellers and brands advertising on Amazon.\"\n\nOther companies including Ascendly Marketing are using generative AI imaging tools that combine pictures of public figures with products. In a recent AI-generated campaign, deceased singer Elvis Presley is holding products from Ascendly's client, Fast Passports and Visas.\nAdding such \"whimsical imagery\" has increased social sharing significantly, Marshal Davis, Ascendly's President said. His clients are seeing a bump in sales and Google click-through rates, a trend that Amazon wants to see for its own generative AI ad tools during the holiday season.\nAnalysts expect Amazon's advertising business to earn $14.2 billion during the holiday quarter, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier, according to LSEG estimates.\nThe AI-image generator could encourage hesitant shoppers to open their wallets if targeted products are more relevant, Friedland said.\nAmazon's Prime membership, which costs $14.99 per month or $139 annually, creates a \"huge advantage\" in advertising and better targeting shoppers, which leads to customers making more frequent purchases, Witcher said.\n\"Volume of traffic is a critical component for success in online advertising,\" he said.\nAmazon forecasts holiday-quarter revenue in the range of $160 billion and $167 billion, compared to analysts' forecasts of $165.6 billion. Amazon's revenue in the fourth quarter last year was $149.2 billion.\nAmazon's AI-imaging poses a threat to smaller advertising firms and freelancers who focus on graphic design, Ascendly's Davis said.\nIf widely adopted, Amazon's AI tools could also have another downside: producing ads with similar images for different products, making it harder for sellers to stand out.\n\"This could make it difficult for brands to differentiate themselves,\" Davis said.\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York City.

        "text": "\nDisney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger has faced many challenges since stepping back into the CEO position nearly one year ago \u2014 but he's well equipped to handle them, according to his former head of streaming Kevin Mayer.\n\"Bob has his hands full,\" Mayer, who now runs Blackstone-backed entertainment startup Candle Media, said at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Tuesday.\nDisney's stock has hit multiyear lows, and activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing for multiple board seats at the company. The company's parks business is slowing, its linear TV division is declining, and its streaming business is not yet profitable.\n\"Someone like Bob, he's very capable, he's multifaceted,\" Mayer continued. \"He has a lot of range so he can handle it. Not everyone can handle a situation like that. But I think you have to be disciplined, and Bob's always been very strategic.\"\nMayer, who is currently serving as a strategic adviser to Iger, added his former boss at Disney will \"look at all his options\" and ultimately make the decision that best benefits shareholders.\n\"When you do the right things strategically for the long term that don't hurt you too much for the short term, I think you can work through these multiple issues,\" he said.\nDisney has seen shares slide about 3% since the start of the year \u2014 massively underperforming the S&P's (^GSPC) 14% gain over that same time period.\n\nMayer said the stock is reacting to multiple uncertainties \u2014 from the future of Hulu and ESPN to the ultimate fate of linear networks \u2014 but that Disney is beginning to address some of those challenges.\n\"When the stock price goes up and [Iger] articulates a great strategic vision \u2014 that will take care of most most of the problems,\" he said.\nDisney recently committed to purchasing Comcast's (CMSCA) 33% stake in Hulu and just named its next CFO after the departure of longtime executive Christine McCarthy.\nThe company also raised streaming prices for the second time this year, upping the monthly price of its ad-free Disney+ and Hulu plans by more than 20%. Mayer said he believes streaming will reach profitability \"very, very soon\" while gaming is an untapped area that the company will be able to leverage in the future.\n\"No matter what happens to those linear networks, you have a really great growth company sitting there \u2014 [it's] a really bright future,\" he said\nIger said earlier this summer the company would take an \"expansive\" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling they could potentially be sold.\nAnalysts have questioned who would want to buy them given secular declines in linear television as more consumers cut the cord, or drop their cable packages.\nMayer said he's not sure who ultimately would buy a network like ABC but said one upside to linear businesses are their profit margins, which are often in the range of 30% to 40%, sometimes more.\n\"Streaming will really never get to that profitability level,\" he said, noting even a profitable streaming company like Netflix (NFLX) will likely tap out at margins in the 25% to 30% range.\nLooking ahead, the executive said digital, more Hollywood-centric players might make the most sense as buyers for such assets \u2014 especially given the competitive environment and likelihood of consolidation.\n\"You can see consolidation among these big media companies happening,\" he said, \"You can see a Warner Bros. (WBD) combining with an NBCUniversal or with a Paramount \u2014 there are some combinations to be had there. Starz is still sitting out there owned by Lionsgate. That needs to be consolidated with someone, maybe a big digital player or by a Hollywood player.\"\nEven Mayer's own Candle Media could be acquired. Mayer laid out three visions for the entertainment company: an acquisition by a strategic buyer like Disney or Warner Bros. Discovery, a public offering, or sale to another private equity firm.\n\"Who knows, maybe KKR owns us in three years or four years,\" he said. \"But we're set up for any of them.\"\nSee the latest coverage from Yahoo Finance's Invest event:\n'Democracy is on the line': Former CNN boss on 2024 election\nFormer CNN boss Jeff Zucker: 'Cable is still powerful'\nAnthony Scaramucci on clawing back FTX's 30% stake in his firm\nConsumers will pay up for new ESPN streaming service, former Disney exec says\nCava aims to forge a new path in fast casual, says CEO\nMarriott CEO: We remain committed to the Middle East\nConsumers 'starting to cut back' on discretionary spending, Klarna CEO says\nWhat Americans get wrong about the Biden economy\n3 warning signs for Biden: Yahoo Finance-Ipsos poll\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

For the week, the index was down 0.5%, after slipping 1.9% last week.\nThe index is on course for its weakest monthly performance in a year on growing expectations the Federal Reserve is done with raising interest rates and could start cutting them next year.\nElsewhere, the Japanese yen was about flat against the dollar at 149.45, after strengthening on news that Japan's core consumer price growth picked up slightly in October.\nThe data reinforced investors' views that stubborn inflation may push the BOJ to roll back monetary stimulus before long.\nING economists said they expect the BOJ to move away from its super-accommodative stance next year.\n\"We believe that the BOJ may scrap the yield curve programme as early as the first quarter of next (year), as Japanese government bonds appear to have stabilised,\" they said.\nThe bank will \"then begin its first rate hike in Q2 2024 if wage growth continues to accelerate next year.\"\nThe nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.9% year on year in October, government data showed on Friday, against 3.0% expected by economists in a Reuters poll.\nThe euro was 0.39% higher at $1.0946 after data confirmed an initial estimate published in late October that showed Germany's economy shrank slightly in the third quarter from the previous three months.\nGerman business morale improved for a third straight month in November, data showed.\nThe single currency is pausing after gaining ground on Thursday on a series of preliminary surveys showing recession in Germany may be shallower than expected, which offset a downbeat reading on French business activity.\nSterling rose 0.57% to its highest since early September after data on Thursday showed British companies returned to growth in November, fuelling hopes Britain will avoid a recession.\nIn cryptocurrency markets, bitcoin rose 1.14% to $37,728, its highest since May 2022.

Governments in 13 of the G20 members will reduce emissions by an average of 4.5% annually between 2022 and 2030, up from a 0.8% annual fall in the five years after the Paris Agreement, MSCI said.\nMSCI's Net-Zero Tracker analysed 4,458 companies that are constituents of the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index and based in G20 countries.\nThe United Nations COP28 climate summit begins this month.

Polish truckers argue it is being applied uniformly to fully loaded EU trucks as well as empty ones, causing long waiting times for the latter.\nThe ministry said among the measures agreed between the countries was the opening of the Uhryniv checkpoint, currently operating only for passenger cars and buses, for free passage of empty trucks aimed at reducing the load on other checkpoints.\nRegistration upon arrival in the electronic system will be introduced for the Nyzhankovychi crossing, along with special passes for empty trucks at two crossings currently under blockade - Yahodyn and Krakivets.\n\"At the same time, Polish protesters insist on the operation of Uhryniv \u2013 Dolgobychow and Nyzhankovychi \u2013 Malchowice only for transport registered in the EU.

It said it would review the decision again next month.\nAramco said total hydrocarbon production in the quarter was 12.8 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.\nAramco's reported its revenue fell to $113.09 billion in the quarter from $144.99 billion a year earlier, while royalty and other tax payments fell to $14.7 billion from $24.3 billion.\nIt declared a quarterly $19.5 billion base dividend, which is paid regardless of performance. A second $9.87 billion distribution of performance-linked dividends will be paid out in the fourth quarter, based on 2022 and the first nine months of 2023.\nThe Saudi state remains overwhelmingly Aramco's biggest shareholder, and heavily relies on its generous payouts.\nThe government directly holds 90.19%, the sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF) 4% and PIF subsidiary Sanabil another 4%, according to LSEG data.\nSaudi Arabia last week reported a budget deficit of about $9.5 billion in the third quarter.

        "text": "\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has long been recognized for his unorthodox leadership strategies, and perhaps one of the most striking was his approach to employee retention and career development. Central to this philosophy was the idea that empowering employees to pursue their career goals, even beyond the company, was beneficial for both the workforce and the corporation.\nIn his 2014 Letter to Shareholders, Jeff Bezos said, \u201cNothing gives us more pleasure at Amazon than \u2018reinventing normal.'\u201d This mindset underpinned the \u2018Pay to Quit\u2019 program, an innovative measure aimed at prompting Amazon employees to reflect on their career ambitions while ensuring the company maintained a workforce that was dedicated and enthusiastic.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWith returns as high as 300%, it\u2019s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret.\nUntil 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups. Thanks to changes in federal law, this Kevin O\u2019Leary-backed startup lets you become a venture capitalist with $100.\nOriginally inspired by a similar program at Zappos, Amazon adapted the Pay to Quit program within its fulfillment centers, offering employees a sum to leave the company. Starting at $2,000, the offer increased by $1,000 each year, capping at $5,000. This unconventional tactic was presented with the tagline \"Please Don't Take This Offer,\" indicating that Amazon's preference was for employees to remain with the company.\nThe rationale behind this offer was simple yet profound: it prompted employees to deeply consider their career paths. If an individual felt their future lay elsewhere, the offer provided a financial cushion to assist them in their transition, ensuring that those who remained were truly invested in their roles and the company\u2019s vision. In the letter, Bezos said: \u201cThe goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they really want. In the long run, an employee staying somewhere they don't want to be isn't healthy for the employee or the company,\u201d affirming the program\u2019s intent to benefit both the employee\u2019s well-being and the company\u2019s health.\nTrending: From Jeff Bezos to Oprah Winfrey, the success stories began with an early investment in startups. Be part of the next big thing here.\nBezos and his team understood that an employee who stayed out of necessity rather than desire could detrimentally affect both their well-being and the organization\u2019s health.\nComplementing Pay to Quit, Bezos instituted the Career Choice program, which underscored his commitment to workforce development. By pre-paying 95% of tuition for courses in in-demand fields, Amazon empowered its employees to further their education in areas such as nursing or aircraft mechanics, regardless of their applicability to Amazon itself. The intent was to cultivate choice and facilitate personal growth, recognizing that for some, Amazon may have been a stepping stone to varied career trajectories.\nThis strategic approach to human resources was telling of Amazon's ethos under Bezos's guidance \u2014 one that prized innovation and customer satisfaction but not at the expense of its employees\u2019 career fulfillment. While investing in the continuous growth of its services and products, Amazon also invested in the potential of its workforce, acknowledging that its success was interlinked with the individuals who upheld the company's operations.\nThe \u201cwow\u201d factor, a term often associated with Amazon\u2019s customer service mantra, can also be seen as a guiding principle for investors looking at startups. Jeff Bezos began Amazon in his garage, turning a visionary idea into a powerhouse brand that transformed global e-commerce. This transformation from a small startup to a major corporate player highlights the dramatic growth that innovative new companies can achieve. Investing in startups offers individuals the opportunity to be part of the next big success story.\nThese programs reflected a larger trend in corporate management that values long-term success over short-term gains and considers employee satisfaction as a cornerstone of a thriving company. Bezos\u2019s philosophy was not without risks, yet it was initiatives like these that continually positioned Amazon as a leader in not just market share but also in its progressive approach to workplace dynamics.\nIn 2022, Amazon suspended the Pay to Quit program. This decision came after a period of unprecedented growth and change for the company, which included coping with the global e-commerce surge and labor shortages prompted by the pandemic. The suspension of the program took place against a backdrop where Amazon, like many companies, reassessed its operational and strategic priorities following peak seasons that put extraordinary demands on its workforce and infrastructure.\nRead Next:\nThe VC firm that backed Apple before its IPO in 1980 is focusing on AI \u2014 Here's how you can do the same with $1,000.\nThe $340.23 billion wine market has a brave new contender for its throne.

It plans to offer 643 million ordinary shares and wants to list on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. The shares are expected to be priced on Nov. 10.\nReuters reported in June some of the initial plans for the vehicle, which will operate as an independent company, and hold Investcorp's private market co-investments across assets including credit, real estate and private equity.\nThe planned flotation from Investcorp with $50 billion in assets under management, is the first major public deal from the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas conflict unsettled regional markets. Abu Dhabi's stock index is down just under 3% since the conflict began on Oct 7, and down 7% year-to-date.\nFounded in 1982, making it one of the oldest Middle Eastern private equity houses, Investcorp is best known in the globally for listing luxury goods brands such as Gucci and Tiffany & Co, but it has increasingly branched out into other sectors.\nInvestcorp said on Thursday that IVC Strategic Investment, a special purpose vehicle, signed up as a cornerstone investor in the IPO with a commitment of roughly $250 million.\nThe vehicle was set up to act as an aggregator of orders from certain wealth management investors and a prominent Abu Dhabi-based investor, the company added.\nThe vehicle includes the top 160 investors from the six Gulf countries and the IPO has been covered in the first hour by strong demand from local, Gulf and international institutional investors, a source familiar with the matter said.\nInvestcorp declined to comment.\nUnder the leadership of Mohammed Al Ardhi, current executive chairman, Investcorp has grown its assets under management fivefold over the last seven years by diversifying into sectors including infrastructure and insurance.\nIt listed two blank check companies on the Nasdaq, has also diversified its sources of fundraising. Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Company acquired 20% of the firm in 2017.\nInvestcorp joins a growing number of companies looking to list in the region, where there were 23 new stock market listings in the first half of 2023, more than any other first-half total since 2008.\nIPO activity in the Gulf is picking up after the pace slowed from an exceptional 2022. Saudi Arabia and the UAE led new listings that year, raising nearly $22 billion - more than half the total for the wider Europe, Middle East and Africa region, Dealogic data shows.\nBy contrast, private equity firm CVC has postponed plans for a European IPO this year due to unfavourable market conditions, a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Wednesday.\n($1 = 3.6726 UAE dirham) (Reporting by Chandni Shah in Bengaluru; Editing by Sonali Paul, Janane Venkatraman, Robert Birsel and Miral Fahmy)",

This month, OpenAI, the company that rocked the world a year ago with its launch of ChatGPT, fired and then rapidly rehired its chief executive, Sam Altman, setting off a frenzy of speculation.\nRead More: What\u2019s Effective Altruism? What Does It Mean for AI?: QuickTake\nInternal disagreements had ostensibly flared up over how ambitious OpenAI should be, in light of the potential societal risks. Altman\u2019s reinstatement puts the company on track to pursue his growth plans, including faster commercialization of AI.\nApple has said it plans to tread cautiously in the field of AI, with CEO Tim Cook saying in May that there are \u201ca number of issues that need to be sorted\u201d with the technology. And companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., have agreed to enact voluntary safeguards to minimize abuse of and bias within AI.\nStotzel said he\u2019s less worried about the risks stemming from small-scale AI startups than about those lurking in the world\u2019s tech giants. \u201cThe biggest companies could do the most damage,\u201d he said.\nOther investors share those concerns. The New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System, one of the biggest US public pension plans, said it\u2019s \u201cactively monitoring\u201d how portfolio companies use AI, according to a spokeswoman for the $248 billion plan. Generation Investment Management, the firm co-founded by former US Vice President Al Gore, told clients that it\u2019s stepping up research into generative AI and speaking daily with the companies it\u2019s invested in about the risks \u2014 as well as the opportunities \u2014 the technology represents.\nAnd Norway\u2019s $1.4 trillion sovereign wealth fund has told boards and companies to get serious about the \u201csevere and uncharted\u201d risks posed by AI.\nWhen OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched last November, it quickly became the fastest-growing internet application in history, reaching 13 million daily users by January, according to estimates provided by analysts at UBS Group AG. Against that backdrop, tech giants developing or backing similar technology have seen their share prices soar this year.\nBut the absence of regulations or any meaningful historical data on how AI assets might perform over time is cause for concern, according to Crystal Geng, an ESG analyst at BNP Paribas Asset Management in Hong Kong.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have tools or methodology to quantify the risk,\u201d she said. One way in which BNP tries to estimate the potential social fallout of AI is to ask portfolio companies how many job cuts may occur because of the emergence of technologies like ChatGPT. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen one company that can give me a useful number,\u201d Geng said.\nJonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at Boston-based Trillium Asset Management, which helped push Apple and Meta\u2019s Facebook to include privacy in their board charters, has been pressing tech companies to do a better job of explaining their AI work. Earlier this year, Trillium filed a shareholder resolution with Google parent Alphabet asking it to provide more details about its AI algorithms.\nKron said AI represents a governance risk for investors and noted that even insiders, including OpenAI\u2019s Altman, have urged lawmakers to impose regulations.\nThe worry is that, left unfettered, AI can reinforce discrimination in areas such as health care. And aside from AI\u2019s potential to amplify racial and gender biases, there are concerns about its propensity to enable the misuse of personal data.\nMeanwhile, the number of AI incidents and controversies has increased by a factor of 26 since 2012, according to a database that tracks misuse of the technology.\nInvestors in Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet\u2019s Google have filed resolutions demanding greater transparency over AI algorithms. The AFL-CIO Equity Index Fund, which oversees $12 billion in union pensions, has asked companies including Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. to report on whether they have adopted guidelines to protect workers, customers and the public from AI harms.\nPoints of concern include discrimination or bias against employees, disinformation during political elections and mass layoffs resulting from automation, said Carin Zelenko, director of capital strategies at AFL-CIO in Washington. She added that worries about AI by actors and writers in Hollywood played a role in their high-profile strikes this year.\n\u201cIt just heightened the awareness of just how significant this issue is in probably every business,\u201d she said.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\u201cThe EU may regulate AI that\u2019s tied to anything from a social media platform\u2019s recommendation systems to employment management tools, like resume-sorting software, and credit and exam scoring, deeming them \u2018high risk\u2019 applications. Such systems would need a conformity assessment and to be registered before their placement on the EU market.\u201d\nClick here for the full report by BI\u2019s Tamlin Bason.\nHigh-Risk Requirements\n(Adds Bloomberg Intelligence comment and chart in final paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nScientists and Farmers Race to Save the World\u2019s Banana Supply\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

That\u2019s lower than the 7.48% forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Insurers probably lapped up the paper as they had expressed strong interest before the auction to lock in higher yields to take care of long-term commitments.\nThe nation\u2019s burgeoning life insurance and pension fund industries, driven by an expanding middle class, are changing the landscape for India\u2019s $1 trillion sovereign debt market. India\u2019s yield curve has been nearly flat even amid record borrowing by the government as insurers stepped up purchases of long-term bonds.\nIt\u2019s the insurance companies and provident funds buying at these levels, said Murthy Nagarajan, head of fixed income at Tata Asset Management. \u201cSince we are coming toward the end of the rate hike cycle, the demand is there,\u201d he said.\nThe Reserve Bank of India received 216 bids worth 402 billion rupees for the 50-year paper, more than four times the amount on offer. It sold a total of 300 billion rupees of bonds at Friday\u2019s auction, including the 2028 and 2033 bonds.\nThe government plans to sell 300 billion rupees of the 50-year bond in the October to February period.\nThe sale of long-term bonds may help the government elongate the tenure of debt sold and keep its interest costs under control. Today\u2019s cutoff came in lower than 7.54% yield for the 40-year paper auctioned last week.\nOver one-third of the government\u2019s fiscal second-half bond supply is in papers maturing in 30-50 years. The RBI in September said it planned to add the 50-year bond in response to market demand for ultra-long papers, extending the nation\u2019s yield curve.\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year bond fell one basis point to 7.32% Friday. That on the 40-year note declined two basis points.\nIssuance of long-term paper was a very specific demand made to RBI for a long time, said Umesh Tulsyan, managing director at Sovereign Global Markets in Delhi. \u201cIf the response is good, RBI will definitely continue offering papers in the ultra-long segment,\u201d he said.\n(Updates prices, adds analyst comment)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nShipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\nFoxconn Makes Your iPhone.

        "text": "\nSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fate is now in the hands of 12 jurors, setting up a dramatic conclusion to a trial that captivated the crypto world for the last five weeks.\nThe key question the nine women and three men are likely considering after beginning their deliberations at 3:14 pm ET Thursday: Did the 31-year-old founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX intentionally defraud customers, lenders, and investors?\nProsecutors argued that\u2019s exactly what happened. Bankman-Fried, they say, deliberately stole $14 billion in customer deposits from the exchange in a scheme that he carried out with three of his top executives.\nThe group, prosecutors claimed, allowed Bankman-Fried\u2019s sister crypto trading firm Alameda Research \"secret\" backdoor access to FTX\u2019s customer deposits, then spent the money on investments, loan repayments, political donations, and real estate.\n\"It\u2019s about perception. It\u2019s about stealing. It\u2019s about greed,\" Assistant US Attorney Nicolas Roos said, describing the government's accusations during closing arguments. \"He knew Alameda was taking money from customers, and that makes him guilty of fraud.\"\nBankman-Fried, on the other hand, argued that management screwups \u2014 and not fraud \u2014 were to blame for the undoing of the cryptocurrency exchange. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.\nIn a risky gamble, he took the stand for a dramatic three days at the trial\u2019s end. He repeatedly distanced himself from certain company decisions and actions, arguing that he thought Alameda borrowing and using funds from FTX was \"permissible\" and that any \"borrows\" would be reflected on its balance sheets as liabilities to FTX.\nHe said he didn\u2019t know FTX customer funds were being used to pay off Alameda loans and trading debts until October 2022, roughly one month before the exchange collapsed.\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense lawyer, Mark Cohen, said in his closing argument Wednesday that no witnesses testified that Bankman-Fried told them to break the law. His client, he said, didn\u2019t commit crimes and had been unfairly portrayed by the prosecution as a \"villain.\"\nPoor business decisions, he said, do not equate with fraud. If jurors believe Bankman Fried acted in good faith, he said, then he can't be found guilty of any charges.\n\"We\u2019ll agree that there was a time when Sam was probably the worst-dressed CEO in the world, and had the worst haircut,\" Cohen said. \"That made his life messy,\u201d he added. \"But that\u2019s not a crime.\"\nBankman-Fried faces seven separate criminal charges ranging from wire fraud to money laundering. He also faces even more legal jeopardy in the year ahead. He is scheduled to face a separate set of criminal charges in another trial due to begin in March.\nConvictions on all counts could mean a sentence of more than 100 years in federal prison.\nSome of the most dramatic moments in his current trial came when Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon confronted Bankman-Fried on Monday and Tuesday, asking him to explain his many statements to reporters and what he did in 2022 when it became clear FTX customer funds had been used to pay off Alameda loans and trading debts.\n\"Did you fire anyone for spending $8 billion of customer deposits?\" Sassoon asked.\n\"No,\" Bankman-Fried said.\nMany times on the stand Bankman-Fried responded to questions from prosecutors with \u201cnot sure\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d At one point the judge reprimanded him: \u201cJust answer the question,\u201d Judge Lewis Kaplan said.\nRoos told jurors Wednesday during his closing argument that Bankman-Fried \"came up with a tale that was conveniently put together to exclude himself from the fraud\" at FTX. \u201cOver three days he took the stand and he lied.\"\nHe pointed to six points in time as evidence that Bankman-Fried could have exposed Alameda\u2019s \"giant\" liabilities and secret use of customer funds, yet chose instead to double down on its risk.\nIn September 2021, the prosecutors said, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison to buy back roughly $2 billion in FTX equity from its rival exchange Binance, even though FTX\u2019s revenues were $1 billion.\nBankman-Fried, they said, also commented on a spreadsheet later that same year on which Ellison calculated Alameda\u2019s net asset value to negative $2.7 billion.\nProsecutors contend that Bankman-Fried also lied on the stand when he testified that he didn\u2019t know about Alameda\u2019s use of customer funds until October.\nAll three of his top deputies, Ellison, Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang, they said, testified that they met with Bankman-Fried to discuss Alameda\u2019s $10 billion deficit in June 2022.\nRead the latest news about Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX fraud trial:\nSBF\u2019s risky gamble to testify concludes as FTX trial nears end\nSBF confronted with his own words during cross-examination in FTX trial\nSBF tells jury he didn't take FTX customer money but 'a lot of people got hurt'\nSam Bankman-Fried tells judge he relied on advice from lawyers at FTX\nSam Bankman-Fried to testify in his own defense in FTX trial\nAnother member of SBF's inner circle says crimes were committed at FTX\nProsecutors\u2019 challenge in FTX trial: A scant paper trail left by SBF\nSBF's ex-girlfriend: He 'directed me' to steal billions from FTX\nSBF's problem in FTX trial is evidence from his closest friends\nA social worker, nurse, and librarian will help determine SBF\u2019s fate in FTX trial\nSBF defense in FTX trial: 'There was no theft'\nSam Bankman-Fried faces crypto-crash fatigue with potential jurors in FTX trial\nSam Bankman-Fried begins the fight for his freedom in FTX fraud trial\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTs\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

But the UAW document noted that GM expects to invest $1.25 billion in its Lansing Grand River plant in Michigan and $391 million in its Fairfax, Kansas, plant.\nGM is considering whether to build a lower-cost version of the Bolt electric utility vehicle at the Fairfax plant in 2025 and the premium EVs for Cadillac and Chevy \u2014 including a pure electric performance model with the Corvette name \u2014 in Lansing beginning in 2027, according to sources familiar with the automaker\u2019s thinking, who asked not to be identified.\nGM said on Monday it would not comment on the tentative agreement pending ratification by the UAW.\nIn a statement, the company said, \"We'll have more specifics around product details moving forward.\"\nThe UAW summary did not specify products or timing for GM's Fairfax and Lansing plants. GM currently builds the Chevrolet Malibu and Cadillac XT at Fairfax and the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 and Chevrolet Camaro in Lansing. All of the vehicles have combustion engines.\nChief Executive Officer Mary Barra has said the current Bolt will be phased out of production at the end of this year. She said GM expects to introduce a revised Bolt with lower-cost batteries, but has not said when or where the new model will be launched.\nThe bulk of GM\u2019s U.S. investments over the contract\u2019s 4-1/2 years \u2014 about $9.1 billion \u2014 will go toward five vehicle assembly plants and seven parts plants to build electric vehicles and components, according to the UAW summary.\nBoth GM and Ford Motor in the past month have announced delays in future EV-related investments.\nGM\u2019s future product investment strategy diverges markedly from those of Ford and Stellantis, where the introduction of hybrid gas-electric models is aimed at consumers who are not prepared or cannot afford to move from combustion models to battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs. GM has not said if it plans to introduce new hybrid models in the U.S.\n\u201cGM\u2019s transition is a little trickier given their focus on BEVs,\u201d said Bill Rinna, director of Americas vehicle forecasts at GlobalData. \u201cBEV demand over the life of the (UAW) contract is certainly not a given, so kicking the can down the road on that front may be justified.\u201d\nSam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, noted the timing on some of the EV investments by GM, Ford and Stellantis was \u201cappropriately vague.\u201d\n\u201cIf the demand for EVs doesn't pick up in the next two to three years, (the timing on) some of these new products could be premature,\u201d he said.\n(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

October began with the eight-day Golden Week national holiday, where tourist spending per person remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nBeijing in late October announced an unusual 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) additional government bond issuance, earmarked for post-flood recovery and disaster prevention. While that can help support employment, \u201cit still does not seem sufficient to improve consumer demand,\u201d Von Mehren added.\nThe QuantCube indicators are based on alternative data sources, such as web search queries, transportation figures reflecting people\u2019s movements, and consumer reviews.\n\u201cDespite the government\u2019s latest financial stimulus, during October our data indicates a persistent deceleration across all sectors, notably in transportation,\u201d the company said in a report.\nMorning Consult\u2019s consumer sentiment index \u2014 which asks consumers about their personal finances, expectations for business conditions and attitudes on major household purchases \u2014 fell below 150 for the first time since February, the company said in a report.\n\u201cConfidence in China is falling fast,\u201d it added.\nIn addition, an index of private sector business conditions by CKGSB in Beijing fell slightly in October from the previous month and remained below the threshold indicating confidence. The survey covers privately owned companies that are generally relatively successful within their sectors.\nThe survey\u2019s index of profit expectations has remained below the confidence threshold for five successive months. \u201cFor profit expectations to stay below the confidence threshold for an extended period has not been often seen in our 12-year-long survey,\u201d the business school said in a report.\nOn Wednesday, China is set to release official data including retail sales for October. Several indicators are expected to improve from September in year-on-year terms, partly because many cities tightened coronavirus restrictions in October last year, resulting in a lower base of comparison.\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. economists expect retail sales growth to rise to 6.2% on-year in October, from 5.5% the previous month. But that implies a 0.5% drop in month-over-month annualized terms, compared with an increase in September.\n\u201cWith PMIs disappointing and exports declined by more than expected, we think activity probably softened from September to October,\u201d Goldman economists led by Hui Shan wrote in a note. Combined with signs of weaker housing and steel demand in early November, \u201cgrowth appears to be hitting a soft patch\u201d in the first half of the fourth quarter, they said.\nRetail sales growth generated by China\u2019s biggest online shopping festival, which runs from October through November, was slower than in previous years. The value of sales rose 2.1% from last year, significantly lower than the 14% increase recorded in 2022, and apparently the lowest in many years, Nomura Holdings Inc. economists led by Lu Ting said in a note citing third party data.\nChina\u2019s property sector also shows signs of worsening this month, Nomura said, with sales in 21 major cities falling 44% from 2019 levels in the early weeks of November. That\u2019s similar to the pace of contraction in July, before Beijing started a new round of property easing measures, the bank said.\n\u201cBeijing needs to take stronger action to rescue the property sector and clean up local government debt to secure a more sustainable recovery,\u201d it added.\nThe next scheduled opportunity to assess the government\u2019s support for the economy also comes on Wednesday, when the central bank reveals the volume of funds it will inject into the banking system through its medium-term lending facility, and the interest rate on that lending. China\u2019s money-market saw a liquidity scare in late October.\n\u201cWeak inflation and the recent liquidity squeeze call for stronger policy support this week,\u201d Carlos Casanova, senior Asia economist at Union Bancaire Privee in Hong Kong, wrote in a note, adding that a 10-basis-point cut to the lending rate from its current 2.5% level was possible. \u201cFrankly speaking, the sooner the better,\u201d he said.\n(Updates with additional data and comment from sixteenth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\nA German Startup Races Google to Develop a Universal Translator\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Retail investors, with about eight times the amount of cash in their accounts that funds now have, have dominated sales.\nNext up to list are one of the country\u2019s biggest independent fuel retailers, offering an amount that\u2019s twice as much as all the other sales combined, and a gold miner that was sanctioned by the UK this week. EuroTrans, with 26.5 billion rubles of shares for sale, plans to list on Nov. 21, according to a statement on its website. On Thursday, gold miner Yuzhuralzoloto said it will offer a 5% stake to investors this month. The company may seek a valuation of 120 billion rubles, RBC newswire reported last week.\nVodka maker Kaluga Distillery Kristall and Mosgorlombard, a pawnshop chain based in the capital, also said they\u2019re planning to list shares soon. Five companies are preparing IPOs before the year ends, depending on market conditions, Interfax reported, citing the Moscow Exchange\u2019s Natalia Loginova.\nDifferent Market\n\u201cExpectations of a large number of IPOs are finally coming true, but the market has completely changed,\u201d Maxim Orlovsky, co-chief executive officer for Russia at Renaissance Capital investment bank, said by phone. Without institutional investors as buyers, the deals will remain small, he said.\nAfter surging to a decade high of more than $3 billion sold in Moscow and London in 2021, the IPO pipeline shut when President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in Feb. 2022. Funds fled the market as the US and EU piled on sanctions. The only sale last year, by e-scooter firm Whoosh, raised $33 million.\nBut for citizens who\u2019ve remained at home, the desire for a return on their savings is aligning with the needs of local companies suddenly facing severe limitations on their access to capital. While banks offer interest rates of around 10% on deposits, the MoEx Russia stock index has jumped 50% this year, one of the best performances among stock indexes tracked by Bloomberg globally.\nRussian money isn\u2019t very welcome abroad, making domestic options for investment more appealing, said Oleg Vyugin, a former senior official at the central bank and Finance Ministry. \u201cNot all the money left Russia, but the gate has closed.\u201d\nMore than 80% of the trading volume in shares now comes from private investors, according to the Moscow Exchange. Retail accounts soared to 8 trillion rubles at the end of the second quarter, 48% higher than a year earlier, according to the Bank of Russia. At the same time, funds that used to dominate IPOs manage only about 1 trillion rubles.\nMore Deals\nMore and possibly bigger deals may be encouraged by a government directive to Russian investors who scooped up assets from departing foreign businesses \u2014 that some of those shares must be listed. Such share offers should be held one to three years after deals are closed, Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said in October.\nThe multitude of small players may increase the risks in Moscow\u2019s market, while \u201cthe absolute dominance of retail investors makes trading itself more volatile,\u201d said Elena Kozhukhova, an analyst at Veles Capital.\nFor now, though, retail investors are taking advantage of the opportunities, with companies such as Astra Group PJSC nearly doubling in the opening days of trading.\n\u201cI secured my best IPO trade result ever,\u201d Vladimir G., 36, said of Astra, asking not to provide his full name to protect his financial security.

        "text": "\n(Adds details from blog post in paragraph 7, background on Cruise in paragraphs 11-13)\nBy David Shepardson and Ben Klayman\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, Nov 14 (Reuters) - General Motors' Cruise driverless car unit said on Tuesday it will pause all supervised and manual car trips in the U.S. and expand the scope of investigations at the robotaxi operator in the aftermath of an accident that initially led to the suspension of driverless vehicle operations.\n\"This orderly pause is a further step to rebuild public trust while we undergo a full safety review,\" Cruise said in a blog post. \"We will continue to operate our vehicles in closed course training environments and maintain an active simulation program in order to stay focused on advancing AV technology.\"\nCruise also said in the blog post that Exponent, an independent engineering firm previously hired to perform a technical root cause analysis of the Oct. 2 incident, would expand that probe to include a \"comprehensive review\" of its safety systems and technology.\nIn addition, Cruise will hire an outside safety expert to review the company's safety operations and culture, according to the blog post. That would be in addition to the permanent chief safety officer it previously said it will hire.\nThe actions followed a Cruise board meeting in San Francisco on Monday, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Cruise previously said it had retained law firm Quinn Emanuel to examine Cruise's response to the accident.\nCruise also said in the Tuesday blog post it will bring in GM general counsel Craig Glidden as chief administrative officer to oversee several teams at Cruise while retaining his responsibilities at the Detroit automaker.\nThe teams under Glidden include communications and finance, according to the blog post. Some investors felt the communications department mishandled Cruise's explanations for what happened during the Oct. 2 accident, where one of Cruise's self-driving vehicles braked but did not avoid striking and dragging a pedestrian who had previously been struck by a hit-and-run driver.\nCruise had been operating an Uber-like service with unmanned vehicles, primarily in San Francisco, but following the accident it halted that service. Tuesday's blog post showed that suspension was expanded to vehicles operated by human safety drivers, affecting about 70 vehicles.\nCruise is competing with Alphabet's Waymo unit and others to develop the robot cars for wider production and deployment. Perfecting the technology will take years of real- world testing, but the companies have run into resistance from some lawmakers and citizens who fear the vehicles are as yet unproven and pose a safety risk.\nGM CEO Mary Barra, who also sits on Cruise's board, has told investors Cruise could generate $50 billion in revenue by 2030. The operation lost more than $700 million in the third quarter of this year as it has increased spending to expand operations to 15 U.S. cities.\nOn Nov. 8, GM\nrecalled 950 driverless cars\nto upgrade software and said more recalls would likely be issued. Two days earlier, GM said it\nwould halt production\nof its fully autonomous Cruise Origin van.\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last month it was investigating the safety of Cruise vehicles.\nEarlier in October, the\nCalifornia Department of Motor Vehicles\nordered Cruise's driverless cars to be removed from state roads, calling them a public hazard and alleging the company had \"misrepresented\" the safety of the technology.

Several veterans told Bloomberg that paperwork delays by their mortgage servicers had pushed them into delinquency and foreclosure.\nUnder the forbearance program, borrowers could work out agreements with their servicers to repay the arrears, called loan modifications. For veterans, one potential modification, called a partial claim, allowed them to defer paying those arrears until their mortgage matured. While that program ended in October 2022, the VA said Friday that it would now allow veterans to obtain \u201ca zero-interest, deferred-payment loan\u201d for the duration of the pause.\n--With assistance from Ann Choi and Polly Mosendz.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nInflation Raging in Triple Digits Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\nThe Impact and Cost of Musk\u2019s Endorsement of Antisemitism on X\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

It's the fourth straight quarter these funds saw negative net outflows.\n\"There have always been multiple drivers of motivation for investors and sustainability-focused funds, some of which I think we would expect to be more durable than others,\" Alyssa Stankiewicz, associate director of sustainability research at Morningstar and the report's author, told Yahoo Finance. \"Perhaps rising energy prices and broader global macroeconomic events over the past year and a half have weakened the rationale for keeping those in the portfolio if you're looking specifically at performance drivers.\"\nA political backlash against ESG investing \u2014 which combines risk factors from carbon emissions to corporate governance to labor disputes under one framework \u2014 also didn't help sentiment.\nAlthough investors pulled money from traditional funds as well, the outflows were more significant among those with sustainable labels. Overall US long-term funds contracted by $3.9 billion during the third quarter, representing a mere 0.02% decline. Sustainable funds, meanwhile, fell by 0.85%.\nFurthermore, more sustainable funds closed in the third quarter than were opened \u2014 the first time this has happened in recent history. Three new sustainable funds were launched during the quarter while 17 others either closed or removed their sustainable mandates, as investors turned their focus to other themes such as options trading, emerging markets, and artificial intelligence.\nThe decline in sustainable funds and beaten-down clean energy stocks has been especially stark given the boom in the space between the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2022. Assets in sustainable funds fell to $298.8 billion in Q3 of this year, down 17% from the record $358.2 billion in Q1 2021.\nThe passage of President Biden's landmark climate law over a year ago, which has begun delivering substantial investment in the green transition, was expected to provide another tailwind for clean energy stocks. But some of that optimism has faltered in recent quarters.\n\"We haven't necessarily seen that play out, which is a bit of a surprise,\" Stankiewicz said about the expected investment boost from the law.\nA few funds have been especially hard-hit. The passively managed iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) and the actively managed Parnassus Core Equity fund (PRBLX) saw the greatest outflows of their kind, losing roughly $2.1 billion and $600.7 million, respectively, during the quarter. The largest climate fund, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), has also struggled, losing more than $794.2 million this year.\nNevertheless, there were pockets in the sustainable fund landscape that continued to see demand.\nUS sustainable bond funds netted positive flows for the third straight quarter, drawing in $639.3 million, as the Fed strengthened its commitment to a \"higher for longer\" policy stance for interest rates.\nAnd while the appetite for ESG has been shaken, there continued to be demand for climate-specific funds focused on specialized areas such as clean energy.\nGlobally, climate funds pegged to the green transition grew by 30% to $534 billion from the beginning of 2022 through June of this year, according to Morningstar, though demand for these funds in the US lagged that in Europe and China.\n\"Climate funds definitely have seen stronger demand than the broader sustainable funds landscape in the US,\" Stankiewicz said. \"2022 was certainly not as strong, but it was positive. So we're definitely seeing more consistent demand for those funds.\"\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "text": "\nA look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nIf investors were wondering why Federal Reserve rhetoric remains so doggedly hawkish, the latest U.S. consumer price inflation report on Tuesday will likely explain why.\nAccording to consensus forecasts at least, U.S. headline inflation is expected to have retreated sharply again in October back toward midyear lows around 3.3%. A near 15% drop in retail gasoline prices since late September should help see to that.\nBut underlying 'core' inflation is expected to stay stickier at an unchanged annual rate of 4.1% last month and still more than twice the Fed's target.\nThere's been more encouraging news on inflation expectations, however, with the New York Fed's latest survey of household sentiment showing a one-year inflation outlook slipping to 3.6% last month and as low as 2.7% over five years.\nBut the Fed may want to hang tough long enough into a slowing economy to ensure that inflation is squeezed back to its 2% goal. Goldman Sachs, for example, reckons the hard part of the Fed's fight is over but it may not start cutting rates until the fourth quarter of 2024.\nFutures markets are still more optimistic - seeing the first quarter-point cut fully priced by July and 75 basis points of easing in total in the mix by the end of next year. The worrying state of U.S. small businesses will be seen in the NFIB report for October out later today.\nLong-term investors think the Fed is just playing a holding game and ultimately the cooling economy will allow it to ease enough to make today's juicy bond yields worth snapping up.\nBank of America's latest monthly funds survey shows global asset managers holding their biggest overweight position in bonds since March 2009 - and some 61% think yields will be lower in 12 months' time than they are now.\nAnd perhaps the negative tilt on October core inflation going into today's release leaves more room for a positive surprise. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields hovered just above 4.60%, the dollar index was a touch softer and S&P500 futures were marginally positive ahead of the bell.\nAlthough U.S. crude oil prices have backed up again in recent days, they remain 18% below September's peak and year-on-year losses are running at almost 10%.\nThe global demand picture remains hard to parse.\nThe International Energy Agency on Tuesday raised its oil demand growth forecasts for this year and next despite the weakening economic picture.\nThe euro zone economy contracted 0.1% as expected in the third quarter, meantime, raising the prospects of a technical yearend recession and contrasting with the U.S. boom during the same quarter. However, the data wasn't all bad and employment continued to increase in the bloc in Q3.\nElsewhere, the focus shifts to California as China's President Xi Jinping starts his first U.S. visit since 2017 ahead of Wednesday's summit with President Joe Biden in San Francisco during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering there this week.\nThe White House said on Monday that Biden and Xi will discuss strengthening communication and managing competition.\nIn the background for XI is the country's ongoing property sector and local debt concerns. Reuters reported on Tuesday that China has ordered its local governments to halt public-private partnership projects identified as \"problematic\" and replaced a 10% budget spending allowance for these ventures with a vetting mechanism as it tries to curb municipal debt risks.\nIn Japan, the yen continued to stalk 33-year lows set in October last year at 151.94 per dollar - with markets wary of Bank of Japan intervention should it plunge through there. Japan's Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government would take all necessary steps to respond to currency moves, repeating his mantra that excessive swings were undesirable.\nIn corporate news, Home Depot reports earnings in a big week for U.S. retailers.\nIn deals, Glencore sealed a deal for a 77% stake in Canadian miner Teck Resources' steelmaking coal business for $6.93 billion in cash, paving the way for a spin-off of the commodity giant's own coal business.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:\n* U.S. Oct consumer price inflation, NFIB Oct small business survey\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Chicago Fed chief Austan Goolsbee all speak; Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr testifies before Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill speaks\n* China's President Xi Jinping starts visit to United States\n* U.S. corporate earnings: Home Depot\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Christina Fincher, mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

        "text": "\nXi Jinping is having dinner Wednesday night with American CEOs at a time of rising US skepticism about China's tighter business controls and concerns about that country's slowing economy.\nIt was a much different story eight years ago, the last time Xi held court with American executives on US soil.\nIn 2015, American CEOs flocked to see the Chinese president while downplaying concerns about China\u2019s state control of its economy, which was then churning out a 7% GDP growth rate.\nThat trip included a tour of Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) campus and a picture of Xi standing next to several rows of executives lining up to meet him, from Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) then-CEO Jeff Bezos to Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook.\nZuckerberg, who was eager at the time to reverse Facebook\u2019s ban in China, greeted Xi first and spoke in Mandarin, according to reports from that trip. \"Did you feel the room shake?\" Cook was even quoted as saying about Xi's entrance.\nBut this week \u2014 with Facebook still banned in China and Zuckerberg himself recovering from an ACL tear \u2014 the Meta head is steering clear of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is one of several leaders not planning to meet with Xi after years of tenser relations with China.\n\"At that time, in 2015, we were a lot more optimistic,\" said Stanford professor Herbert Lin, adding that there had been a hope then that China would eventually be integrated into a larger global economic system.\nLin said companies were well aware of the risks in previous eras but simply calculated they couldn\u2019t pass up the Chinese market.\nNow, \"that belief is now a lot more shaky.\"\nOngoing geopolitical issues between the US and Chinese governments may only exacerbate the tensions in the coming years as Xi tries to simultaneously staunch the outflow of capital from the country while maintaining rigid political controls. Foreign direct investment in his nation turned negative in new data released this month.\nThe US-China Business Council\u2019s annual member survey released in September found that \"geopolitics is the single largest issue weighing down business sentiment\" alongside concerns about China\u2019s domestic policies.\nWhile the pomp and circumstance that comes with any visit is sure to remain this time around, the tone and tenor of Xi\u2019s interactions with CEOs are widely expected to be different.\nIn 2015, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gave Xi a personal tour of his company\u2019s Redmond campus. This week, perhaps the most notable item on his itinerary is a panel alongside the leaders of Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, and Chile as those nations aim to woo some US investment away from China.\nMicrosoft, to be sure, has an ongoing presence in China that stretches back decades and Nadella himself has maintained a bullish outlook for Asia in recent comments.\nOther CEOs from Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Elon Musk to Citigroup\u2019s (C) Jane Fraser are also seen as likely to seek an audience with XI this week as they try to maintain and grow the presence of their companies in China.\nBut Xi clearly has a challenge before him as he prepares to speak to assembled CEOs Wednesday night at a dinner reportedly organized by the National Committee on US-China Relations and the US-China Business Council.\n\"Beijing is trying to counter a US narrative that China has become 'uninvestable,'\" said Reva Goujon, a director at Rhodium Group, in a recent client note.\nBut she added in an interview that Xi still has opportunities to dangle before CEOs.\n\"If you're in the EV business, for example, this is still the largest EV market in the world,\" she said.\nNicholas Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicts that Xi\u2019s speech Wednesday \"will say lots of good things about how open China is [but] the reality has moved in the opposite direction.\"\nIn spite of Xi\u2019s rhetoric and some desire to goose the inflow of foreign investment and expertise, the Chinese leader has prioritized state control for years now, Lardy said, and many in the business community are now catching on to that shift.\n\"I don't think there's going to be much uptake\" for Xi\u2019s message, he added.\nXi is also sitting down Wednesday with US President Joe Biden in a meeting that the White House hopes will help stabilize the relationship between the two superpowers.\nBut White House officials have warned the bilateral meeting has little chance of offering breakthroughs on economic concerns from trade tensions to semiconductor export controls.\nWhile Xi and Biden are hoping to announce some progress on issues like cooperation on AI, curbing fentanyl, and resuming military communication, few expect the larger issues to be resolved anytime soon.\n\"People really do believe China is an adversary,\" says Lin of the overall political climate. \"It's the one place where both Republicans and Democrats really agree.\"\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\n(Adds final news conference)\nBy Jan Strupczewski\nBRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - France and Germany will discuss later this month how strict new EU fiscal and debt rules should be, to create a basis for a pan-European deal by the end of the year, the finance ministers of both countries said on Thursday.\nThe talks are part of a revision of the EU's fiscal rules that underpin the euro and that financial markets are watching closely. The rules have been suspended since 2020 but are to be reinstated from 2024, and EU governments want to update them before they kick in again.\nEU finance ministers discussed changes to the rules at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday and would meet again for an extra session at the end of the month to boost the chances of a deal at their next regular meeting scheduled for Dec. 8.\n\"There is still a final mile to walk but, like the pilgrims in the Camino de Santiago (ancient pilgrimage routes), we're starting to see the cathedral at the end of the way,\" Spanish Finance Minister Nadia Calvino, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency and is therefore in charge of finding a compromise, told a news conference.\n\"We see there is a very strong commitment by all member states to contribute to work together and to reach a balanced deal before the end of the year,\" she said.\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner said before the meeting that his French counterpart Bruno le Maire would visit him later in November to discuss the \"level of ambition\" between the two biggest EU countries who are key to reaching a deal.\n\"A Franco-German initiative could lead to a mutual understanding among all EU member states,\" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said.\nBALANCING DEBT REDUCTION AND INVESTMENT\nThe Stability and Growth Pact rules limit budget deficits to 3% of GDP and debt to 60%, with disciplinary steps for those not cutting any excess fast enough.\nMany European governments far exceed the limits now, while also needing to invest to fight climate change.\nThe European Commission initially proposed that any decline in debt over four years should be acceptable. Germany insisted on minimum annual amounts, called benchmarks, that would be the same for all.\nBerlin also wants the new rules to say governments should aim for budget deficits below 3%, creating a buffer to cover unexpected events. Lindner told reporters that the idea of buffers on debt to GDP and annual deficits was acknowledged in the latest compromise proposal by the Spanish presidency.\n\"So now it is about numbers, not only instruments so I am optimistic but much more work needs to be done,\" he said.\nEU ministers also are haggling over the balance of power between them and the European Commission and how to effectively enforce the rules.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno le Maire said ministers wanted a deal on new rules by the end of the year.\n\"The EU needs those new rules. The old ones are outdated, obsolete. We need to fund our investments, to guarantee the EU's financial stability,\" he said.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Rockstar Games Inc. is preparing to reveal plans for its next entry in the seminal Grand Theft Auto franchise as soon as this week, with a trailer to come in December. As we await further details on GTA VI, here\u2019s a look back at its pedigree and why its release is among the most hotly anticipated events on the games calendar.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAn Opioid-Like Drink Is Masquerading As a Wholesome Alcohol Alternative\nXi Jinping\u2019s \u2018Old Friends\u2019 from Iowa Get a Dinner Invitation\nTrump\u2019s 40 Wall St. Loan Transferred to Special Servicer\nUS Credit-Rating Outlook Changed to Negative by Moody\u2019s\nThe Diamond World Takes Radical Steps to Stop a Pricing Plunge\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about GTA VI?\nGrand Theft Auto VI will be the next major release in a series of action video games initiated in 1997, where the player takes on the role of an antihero avoiding police and driving and shooting across a simulacrum of a real-world city. It was one of the earliest and best attempts at creating what\u2019s become known as an open-world game, where players can choose their own path and missions through the game.\nOver the years, GTA games have grown into a wider cultural phenomenon reaching beyond gaming, as its distinctive style earned loyal players and fans from across the entertainment industry. The series has sold more than 405 million copies, Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. said in August.\nWhat do we know about GTA VI\u2019s content?\nPrevious entries in the series have involved running around recognizable recreations of cities like Miami, Los Angeles and New York. Back in 2022, people familiar with Rockstar\u2019s plans said early designs for the game had called for the inclusion of territories based on large swathes of North and South America. But the company curtailed those ambitions and cut the main map down to a fictionalized version of Miami and its surrounding areas. The game will feature two protagonists, a man and a woman.\nA number of clues to the new game were gleaned from an extensive leak of videos and screenshots posted to the web by a hacker in September 2022. People familiar with the game\u2019s development said the cache showed pre-release footage of the game and Rockstar moved quickly to scrub the images from the internet. Gaming site Games Radar reported that the leak pointed to a modern-day Vice City setting (from the game bearing the same name, based on Miami), fresh gameplay mechanics and improved AI.\nWhen will GTA VI be released?\nIn 2022, industry analysts expected GTA VI would be out sometime in Take-Two\u2019s 2024 fiscal year, which runs from April 2023 through March 2024, but even then developers were skeptical. Video games are notorious for release delays enforced by hitches in development, as highlighted by the ambitious Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s tortured path to release.\nAs of now, we have no idea. The leaked gameplay footage last year was rough and riddled with bugs, with Rockstar promising to introduce the game to players properly \u201cwhen it is ready.\u201d Rockstar doesn\u2019t appear in desperate need to rush out the game: its GTA Online service hosted more users in June this year than in any other June outside of the pandemic, Take-Two said in August.\nHow valuable is GTA VI to Rockstar?\nGTA VI\u2019s predecessor, 2013\u2019s Grand Theft Auto V, was the fastest entertainment release in history to reach $1 billion in retail sales and the best-selling game in the US over the past decade, according to Take-Two. Rockstar has built a growing GTA Online multiplayer platform and community, which it is increasingly monetizing with a paid GTA+ subscription offering, launched in March 2022.\nThe release of GTA VI is expected to drive similar, if not larger, retail sales at its outset and to catalyze growth in revenue from online services and in-game content.\nHow different can we expect GTA VI to be from its predecessors?\nThe franchise\u2019s first two entries featured a distinctive top-down view before it transitioned to 3D graphics with Grand Theft Auto III. In subsequent iterations, Rockstar has invested in developing a more cinematic style, bringing in the voices of celebrities and ramping up the filmlike qualities of its narratives. With competition in this genre of Hollywood-like games rising significantly over the past decade \u2014 as highlighted by Sony Group Corp.\u2019s The Last of Us Part II \u2014 players will expect Rockstar and Take-Two to elevate their own standards and those for the industry.\nBudgets for top-tier titles like GTA and TLOU 2 now habitually stray into nine figures, and given the long-term earning potential indicated by GTA V, Rockstar is likely to invest everything it can in ensuring GTA VI is a similar success.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 While the scandals in the cryptocurrency industry seem to never end, Washington policymakers appear to have little interest in pushing through legislation to codify the structure of the industry.\nThe latest shoe to drop is Binance\u2019s multibillion dollar settlement with U.S. authorities and the resignation of its CEO this week. Before that came the conviction of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried for stealing billions from customers and the implosion of smaller crypto companies that cost investors large sums of money.\nWhen cryptocurrencies collapsed and a number of companies failed last year, Congress considered multiple approaches for how to regulate the industry in the future. However, most of those efforts have gone nowhere, especially in this chaotic year that has been dominated by geopolitical tensions, inflation and the upcoming 2024 election.\nIn fact, the appetite for new rules seems more diminished than ever.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday that existing regulations already apply to cryptocurrency at a news conference announcing the $4 billion settlement with Binance: \u201cI think today's actions show that we are serious about enforcing strong regulations that are already in place to make sure that illegal transactions are not fostered by cryptocurrency entities,\" she said.\n\u201cIn cases like this, where there are violations of a truly egregious nature,\u201d she said \u201cof course we want to make sure our tools stay up to date and are adjusted so that we can address emerging threats. We believe we have strong tools and we have been increasingly deploying them to counter this type of abuse.\"\nAnd a group of more than 100 mostly Democratic lawmakers in October said the responsibility for preventing the use of crypto to finance terrorism belongs to the White House, calling for the Biden Administration to act.\nChangpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a felony related to his failure to prevent money laundering on the platform. Zhao stepped down and Binance admitted to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and apparent violations of sanctions programs, including its failure to implement reporting programs for suspicious transactions.\nAs part of the settlement agreement, the U.S. Treasury said Binance will be subject to five years of monitoring and \u201csignificant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance\u2019s complete exit from the United States.\u201d Binance is a Cayman Islands limited liability company.\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called the settlement one of the largest corporate penalties in the nation\u2019s history.\nNow the largest entities in crypto over the past couple of years \u2014 Binance, Coinbase and FTX \u2014 are either in severe legal trouble, under investigation or have collapsed altogether.\nWithout Congress, federal regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission have stepped in to take their own enforcement actions against the industry, including the filing of lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance and Kraken, three of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. Kraken was charged by the SEC this week with operating its crypto trading platform as an unregistered securities exchange.\nAdditionally, PayPal received a subpoena from the SEC related to its PayPal USD stablecoin, the company said in a filing with securities regulators this month. The firm says its cooperating with authorities.\nSome members of Congress have opposed the SEC's actions on crypto, arguing that the SEC needs congressional approval to justify going after bad actors, or that crypto should be regulated more like a commodity, which would be under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. One or both of those arguments have been made by legislatures in both political parties.\nSens. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and John Boozman, R-Ark., proposed last year to hand over the regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether to the CFTC. Stabenow and Boozman lead the Senate Agriculture Committee, which has authority over that regulator.\nSo while Congress has made proposals it has yet to act. Part of the reluctance to act stems from lawmakers' inability to coalesce around what crypto is in the first place, and further, the opposition from some powerful members of Congress to crypto altogether.\nOne of those members opposed is Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, chair of the Senate Banking Committee.\nBrown has been highly skeptical of cryptocurrencies as a concept and he\u2019s been generally reluctant to put Congress\u2019 blessing on them through legislation. He\u2019s held several committee hearings over cryptocurrency issues, ranging from the negative impact on consumers to use of the currencies to fund illicit activities, but has not advanced any legislation out of his committee.\n\u201cAmericans continue to lose money every day in crypto scams and frauds,\u201d Brown said in a statement after Bankman-Fried was convicted. \u201cWe need to crack down on abuses and can\u2019t let the crypto industry write its own rulebook.\u201d\nIn the House, a bill that would put regulatory guardrails around stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies that are supposed to be backed by hard assets like the U.S. dollar \u2014 passed out of the House Financial Services Committee this summer. But that bill has gotten zero interest from the White House and the Senate.\nConsumer advocates are skeptical about the need for new rules, or the usefulness of crypto itself.\n\u201cThe lawlessness if not criminal activities of crypto will continue and increase until all prosecutors, regulators and elected officials force the industry to act like all other law-abiding people and firms in the financial industry,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a nonprofit that works to \u201cbuild a more secure financial system for all Americans,\u201d according to its website.\nWhereas some analysts say the fraud trials, settlements and criminal charges signal a new era for crypto development.\nYiannis Giokas, senior director of digital assets at Moody\u2019s Analytics said the settlement agreement between U.S. Authorities and Binance \u201cmarks the end of an era.\u201d\n\"With digital currencies becoming more mainstream and institutional players entering the space, regulations and enforcement will become stricter to ensure compliance and consumer protection. Yesterday\u2019s development marks the same inflection point that we saw earlier at the intersection of the .com and post-.com eras.\u201d",

        "text": "\n(Updates with quote from First Quantum's CEO in paragraphs 6 and 7, fresh protests in paragraph 10)\nBy Valentine Hilaire and Divya Rajagopal\nNov 24 (Reuters) - Panama's top court started deliberations on Friday to rule on several constitutional challenges to First Quantum Minerals' contract for the Cobre Panama mine, an outcome keenly watched by the global copper market and investors.\nFirst Quantum has faced massive protests since the Panama government signed a new contract for the Cobre Panama mine on Oct. 20, amid allegations of corruption and lack of transparency in the negotiations. The company has denied any wrongdoing.\nCobre Panama is one of the world's biggest and newest copper mines, producing about 1% of global copper supply.\nA majority of lawyers surveyed by Reuters this month said the Supreme Court is likely to rule against the company, citing a precedent. The court has not given a timeline to release the verdict, but some lawyers and officials expect a decision in the coming days or weeks.\nA ruling against First Quantum will have huge implications. The uncertainty has already wiped about C$10 billion ($7.3 billion), or 50% of its market value, in about a month, impacted copper prices and could be a blow to the Central American nation as the mine accounts for about 5% of its GDP.\nFirst Quantum's \"fall-back legal position is very strong,\" Tristan Pascall, the company's CEO, said in an interview with LatAm Investor published on Thursday when asked whether the miner would receive fair compensation if the government closes the mine.\n\"Over the long-term we've invested more than $10 billion in turning the Cobre Panama into a world-class asset,\" Pascall was quoted as saying.\nChina's Jiangxi Copper Co is First Quantum's biggest shareholder.\nThe demonstrations have turned into an anti-government movement, with protesters demanding an end to all mining activity in the country.\nA protest is expected to be held outside the court later on Friday.\nThe movement has also gained support from activist Greta Thunberg and Hollywood actor Leonardo Di Caprio, who last weekend shared a video from an environmental group that called for the Supreme Court to cancel the contract.\nOn Thursday, First Quantum said the mine is not operating at commercial levels, following blockades by protesters at a key port that have prevented the miner from receiving shipments of coal that power the site and other supplies.\nThe contested contract provides First Quantum a 20-year mining right with an option to extend for another 20 years, in return for $375 million in annual revenue to Panama.\nIf the court deems the contract unconstitutional, Panama would be in a tricky spot, lawyers said, as the government on Nov. 3 signed a bill banning all new mining concessions and extensions. That would prevent the two parties from negotiating a new deal.\nThe contract was inherited by First Quantum in 2013 after it became the operator of the mine. However, Panama's top court in 2017 deemed unconstitutional the law under which First Quantum was operating the mine.\nThe ruling was upheld in 2021, resulting in last month's fresh deal with the government.\n($1 = 1.3718 Canadian dollars)\n(Reporting by Valentine Hilaire and Divya Rajagopal; Writing by Denny Thomas; Editing by Sonali Paul)",

        "text": "\nBy Julie Zhu\nHONG KONG, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets struggled for momentum on Thursday, after heavy gains this week, as expectations for a pause in Fed policy tightening remained intact despite U.S. data pointing to strength in parts of the economy.\nU.S. economic data this week has left investors in the same state of confusion about Fed policy as they have been in for weeks. Retail sales proved strong while producer prices inflation, coming soon after the below-forecast core inflation, reinforced the disinflation theme and supported views of a peak in U.S. rates.\n\"With inflation, labour market and retail sales data now published for this month, and expectations for an FOMC hike in December and January priced at zero, a huge amount of information has been digested by markets in a very short time,\" analysts at ANZ said in a note.\n\"A period of consolidation seems warranted, especially if Fed officials push back against the recent easing in financial conditions.\"\nEarly in the Asian trading day, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2%. The index is up 7.1% so far this month.\nAustralian shares were down 0.33%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index slid 0.36%.\nThe MSCI Asia ex-Japan index, MSCI Emerging Market index and Nikkei all posted their biggest gains in a year, of 2.5% or more, on Wednesday.\nChinese industrial and retail numbers calmed nerves and lifted mainland stocks on Wednesday, with both data beating expectations in October even as the underlying economic picture highlighted significant pockets of weakness with the crisis-hit property sector continuing to forestall a full-blown revival.\nChina's blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.1% lower in early trade. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.35%.\nWhile markets didn't react specifically to the news, investors also heard from the first meeting in a year between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday, that the two leaders had agreed to resume military-to-military communications and cooperate on anti-drug policies.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. stocks closed slightly higher, as the inflation data reinforced investor hopes the Fed is done raising interest rates, while retail stocks were boosted by an upbeat forecast from Target.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.47%, the S&P 500 gained 0.16% and the Nasdaq Composite narrowed earlier gains to end flat.\nMoney market traders have fully priced in the odds that the U.S. central bank will keep rates steady in December, as per CME Group's Fedwatch tool. They also see the first rate cut of the cycle to kick off in May 2024.\nInvestors are increasingly pricing in more rate cuts next year with bond yields and the dollar coming under downward pressure. Some of that reversed on Wednesday, with Treasury yields and the dollar rebounding slightly from the previous session's fall.\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 4.5117% compared with its U.S. close of 4.537% on Wednesday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 4.8991% compared with a U.S. close of 4.916%.\nIn currencies, the European single currency was up 0.1% on the day at $1.0852, having gained 2.61% in a month, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies of other major trading partners, was up at 104.33.\nU.S. crude dipped 0.55% to $76.24 a barrel. Brent crude fell to $80.75 per barrel.\nGold was slightly lower. Spot gold was traded at $1958.49 per ounce.\n(Reporting by Julie Zhu and Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

The fact that just a handful of companies have powered this year\u2019s market gains has fanned concern about the rally\u2019s sustainability. Yet it\u2019s these firms that tend to have the strongest fundamentals to weather the Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening campaign, he said.\n\u201cGoing into year-end now, we\u2019d much rather own the largest-cap names,\u201d Yadava said on Bloomberg Television\u2019s ETF IQ on Monday. \u201cSector by sector, if you throw a dart, we\u2019d rather own the stock that\u2019s in the larger-cap than the smaller-cap because that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the positive earnings revisions, that\u2019s where the balance-sheet strength is, and those are the themes we want to own right now.\u201d\nDespite a turbulent few months, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is still about 40% higher in 2023, a dominant performance fueled by the likes of Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. That group has powered the S&P 500 roughly 14% higher this year as well.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s model portfolios have about $100 billion tracking them. Salim Ramji, global head of iShares and index investments at the firm, predicted in July that the overall industry could grow to $10 trillion over the next five years, from about $4.2 trillion.\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s models briefly went underweight on equities after Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s meltdown in March and the financial industry stress that followed, they started to \u201cedge back into stocks\u201d during the summer, Yadava said. Although the initial thinking was that the rally in the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks would broaden out, that hasn\u2019t happened, he said.\nModel portfolios are a booming corner of the money-management industry. They bundle funds into off-the-shelf packages and have gained popularity with advisers and professional managers alike. As a result, allocation shifts by the biggest providers are sometimes suspected to be behind dramatic flows of money.\nBlackRock\u2019s model portfolio team isn\u2019t alone in the logic of gravitating toward the market\u2019s biggest firms. Large tech companies don\u2019t need to tap the bond market as much as their smaller peers, insulating them from some of the pressure dealt by the Fed\u2019s hiking cycle, according to BNY Mellon Wealth Management\u2019s Alicia Levine.\n\u201cI still think you have to be in large-cap tech. Large-cap tech America is about growth without needing to borrow, so that\u2019s an important story and that\u2019s part of the reason this sector rallied so hard the first part of the year as the Fed was hiking,\u201d Levine, the firm\u2019s head of investment strategy, said on Bloomberg Television.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nWho\u2019s Ready for a Trump-Biden Rematch?

Target, which had given a strong holiday quarter outlook on Wednesday, fell 0.9%, with the broader S&P 500 consumer staples index down 1.1%.\n\"The markets are just taking a step back after some disappointing guidance from Cisco and Walmart,\" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest.\n\"Both are seen as kind of a backbone of their respective industries. So it calls a little bit into question the health of the consumer and maybe the health of the technology sector.\"\nWall Street's main indexes have rallied this week as evidence of cooling inflation in the world's largest economy fueled hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve was most likely done hiking interest rates.\nIn a data-packed week that saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq hitting an over three-month high, markets also took comfort from the U.S. Senate's passage of a stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown.\nKeeping declines in check, U.S. Treasury yields moved lower after the Labor Department's report showed weekly jobless claims had risen more than expected, cementing bets that the Fed will not need to raise rates further.\nThe slip in Treasury yields lifted some megacap stocks, with Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet up between 0.7% and 1.1%.\nWhile money markets have fully priced in a probability that the Fed will hold rates steady in its December meeting, they see about 62% odds of an at least 25-basis-point rate cut in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nEnergy led declines among the 11 major S&P sectors, falling 2.9% and hitting a four-month low as crude prices dropped over 4%.\nAt 11:49 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 135.23 points, or 0.39%, at 34,855.98, the S&P 500 was down 9.34 points, or 0.21%, at 4,493.54, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 44.38 points, or 0.31%, at 14,059.45.\nAmong other stocks,\nPalo Alto Networks fell 6.9% after the cybersecurity company forecast its second-quarter billings below market expectations due to inflationary pressures.\nMacy's shares climbed 6.8% as the department store operator's quarterly sales beat analysts' estimates.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.87-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.35-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 14 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 79 new lows.\n(Reporting by Shristi Achar A and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Pooja Desai)",

The government has already moved to delay a ban on sales of new petrol cars, but officials have repeatedly said ministers were not giving up on the overall targets, just being more \"pragmatic\" in how they get there.\nSunak confirmed in an introduction to the speech he would bring in legislation to hold North Sea oil and gas licensing rounds annually - something Labour has ruled out - to help \"the country to transition to net zero by 2050 without adding undue burdens on households\".\nThat was one of only two new bills expected to be presented to the House of Commons this week, with the remainder being legislative plans rolled over from the previous parliament.\nSunak's government plans to phase out tobacco sales to young people in England and, in an attempt to win over younger voters, press ahead with reforms to the housing market, outlawing no-fault evictions for renters.\nBut Sunak faces an uphill struggle to win back voters, with Labour holding an around 20-point lead in the polls. His party is mired in allegations of sex scandals, under scrutiny over its actions during the COVID-19 pandemic and deeply divided over its strategy before the next election.\nHe is hopeful his agenda can turn things around.\n\"We have turned the corner over the last year and put the country on a better path,\" Sunak said in his introduction.\n\"But these immediate priorities are not the limit of our ambition. They are just the foundations of our plan to build a better future for our children and grandchildren, and deliver the change the country needs.\" (Reporting by Elizabeth Piper, Andrew MacAskill, additional reporting by Alistair Smout, Kylie MacLellan, Paul Sandle, Sarah Young, Kate Holton; Editing by Alex Richardson, Jon Boyle and Christina Fincher)",

The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe pause affects, among others, shotguns and optical sights and the Commerce Department said last month an urgent review will assess the \"risk of firearms being diverted to entities or activities that promote regional instability, violate human rights, or fuel criminal activities.\"\nThe letter, which was also signed by Armed Services Committee chair Mike Rogers, Oversight chair James Comer and Transportation and Infrastructure chair Sam Graves, seeks answers by Nov. 13 to a series of questions and argues that \"continuing this pause will only weaken law-abiding civilians and hand criminal actors a monopoly of force.\"\nThe Republican party has\nconsistently defended gun ownership\nrights under the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, while many Democrats have called for new restrictions after a series of mass shootings.\nThe letter also said the decision could \"adversely affect thousands of Americans whose jobs involve the manufacturing or shipping of these items to overseas locations.\"\nThe halt covers most of the guns and ammunition that could be purchased in a U.S. gun store. U.S. companies that sell firearms, including Sturm Ruger & Co., Smith & Wesson Brands and Vista Outdoor, could be affected by the export ban.\nOverseas customers include distributors and stores that sell firearms. Exporters can continue to submit license requests during the pause, but they will be \"held without action\" until the pause is lifted.\nThe pause does not affect previously issued export licenses, the Commerce Department said. For shipments to government clients, exporters must name specific end users, while applications with unnamed government, military, and police users will be \"returned without action.\" (Reporting by David Shepardson, editing by Deepa Babington)",

Subsidies for fossil fuels totalled $1.3 trillion, and substantially more if counting the societal cost of dealing with emissions and pollution.\nReport co-chair Vera Songwe, an ex-World Bank economist, said the report's focus was on how to advance the investments needed for the world to catch up on Paris Agreement targets to cap global warming well under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F)\n\"That is why we are emphasising speed and scale \u2013 the more we wait, the more expensive it comes,\" she said.\nRECORD OIL AND GAS PROFITS\nThe report's authors said taxes on the record profits made by oil and gas companies, from higher energy prices that followed the Ukraine war, were unlikely to get political traction, in part because many, such as the UAE's ADNOC, are state-owned.\nCo-chair Nicholas Stern, professor at LSE/Grantham Research Institute, said there was a compelling case for energy companies to make voluntary contributions.\n\"I think that moral obligation is something that will be emphasised at COP28, and indeed before and after,\" he said.\nThere are growing calls for a carbon levy on shipping, which transports around 90% of world trade and accounts for nearly 3% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.\nAviation, which accounts for some 2-3% of emissions, is not directly covered by the Paris Agreement but the air transport sector has pledged to align itself with its goals.\nThe panel estimated that emerging and developing economies excluding China will need a total $2.4 trillion investment a year by 2030 - four times current levels - to make the energy transition, adapt their economies and deal with climate damage.\nWhile the bulk of that can be raised domestically, it called on rich nations - already at least two years late on a promise of $100 billion to help poorer countries with climate change - to triple the volume of concessional loans on offer by 2030.\nThe report characterised private finance in emerging and developed countries as \"dismally low\", while development banks were criticised for poor cooperation with the private sector, often competing with it on projects seen easiest to launch.\n(Writing and reporting by Mark John; editing by Barbara Lewis)",

The greenback, however, pared gains after data showed the U.S. manufacturing sector remained weak in November. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its manufacturing PMI was unchanged at 46.7 last month. It was the 13th consecutive month that the PMI stayed below 50, which indicates contraction in manufacturing. Post-manufacturing data, U.S. rate futures on Friday priced in a 56% chance of a rate cut by the March meeting next year, compared to 43% late on Thursday, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. For the May meeting, U.S. rate cut chances surged to 84%, from about 76% the day before. Softer inflation data in both the United States and the euro zone on Thursday reinforced expectations that both central banks might be done raising interest rates in their battle against price rises and led traders to bet on earlier cuts next year. Goldman Sachs on Friday said it now expected the European Central Bank to deliver its first rate cut in the second quarter of 2024, compared to an earlier forecast of a cut in the third quarter of next year. Investors will have their sights trained on a talk due to be given by the Fed's Powell later on Friday for any clues about the future path of interest rates in the U.S. \"That would be the Fed's last opportunity to set the record straight for the meeting before the blackout period,\" said Erik Bregar, director, FX & precious metals risk management, at Silver Gold Bull in Toronto. \"So I think you're just seeing a paring back of post-CPI (consumer price index) decline in the dollar.\" Currency movements were more muted on Friday, after month-end trades on Thursday contributed to bigger swings, analysts said. The U.S. dollar index - which tracks the currency against six major counterparts - was last up 0.2% at 103.69, after clocking its weakest monthly performance in a year in November. Mixed economic data across Europe failed to set the tone for the euro, with a survey showing a downturn in euro zone manufacturing activity eased slightly last month but remained deeply in the red. Britain also reported contraction in manufacturing, but an improved reading for a third straight month. The euro was last down 0.4% at $1.0842, while sterling was flat at $1.2617. Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.1% to 148.09 yen. The yen was on course for its third straight week of gains, pulling it away from the near 33-year low of 151.92 per dollar touched in the middle of November. Rising expectations of the Bank of Japan abandoning its ultra-easy monetary policy next year along with a drop in U.S. yields have buoyed the Asian currency in the past few weeks. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin continued to strengthen, rising to a fresh 18-month high of $38,839.

How do we stop them? How much weight do we want them to lose to get the benefit?\" he said.\nPatients on Wegovy experienced decreases in C-reactive proteins, an indication of inflammation, similar to those reported with cholesterol lowering statins, which are known to significantly lower heart risks, researchers reported.\n\"The cardiovascular benefit (of Wegovy) is a combination of many factors, but I would call out glycemic (blood sugar) control, weight loss and inflammation,\" Martin Lange, Novo Nordisk's head of development, said in an interview.\nIn the 17,604-patient trial with a mean duration of 33 months, almost 1,500 of those taking Wegovy discontinued treatment due to adverse side effects, mostly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea and vomiting, compared to 718 patients in the placebo group, according to the study.\nThough the trial was not conducted to test weight loss, participants lost an average of nearly 10% of their total body weight. Novo said patients in the heart study were not required to track diet and exercise as they are in obesity trials.\nThe study showed Wegovy to be safe and well-tolerated in line with previous semaglutide trials, Novo said.\nIt was unclear whether the results could be applied to all GLP1-class drugs or were specific to semaglutide, Barclays analyst Emily Field said in an interview.\nLange said he expected the company's application to have Wegovy's label updated to include the heart benefits to be approved in the U.S. in the first half of next year and in the EU in the second half. Drug regulators can update the information on medicine labels to include new data or reflect new indications for use after initial approval.\nU.S. and UK drug regulators approved Eli Lilly's rival weight-loss treatment on Wednesday, which had previously been approved and marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes.

NAR faces at least two other similar proposed class actions.\nIn Monday's lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan, plaintiff Monty March said commissions on Manhattan residential sales remain a stable 5% to 6% even as home prices soar, with the average apartment price topping $2 million by early 2022.\nMarch said sellers using REBNY's listing service should not pay 2.5% to 3% commissions to buyers' brokers given how commissions are lower in \"fully competitive\" markets such as Brooklyn, where they are negotiated separately and average 1%.\nREBNY General Counsel Carl Hum said the group was reviewing the complaint with its lawyers, and was confident its listing service's practices and procedures \"abide by all relevant laws.\"\nCorcoran and Douglas Elliman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nMarch said he paid inflated commissions when he recently sold property on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

        "text": "\nBy Howard Schneider and Michael S. Derby\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as policymakers struggled to determine whether financial conditions may be tight enough already to control inflation, or whether an economy that continues to outperform expectations may need still more restraint.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said the situation remained something of a riddle, with U.S. central bank officials willing to raise rates again if progress on inflation stalls, wary that a rise in market-based interest rates may begin to weigh on the economy in a significant way, and trying not to disrupt, any more than necessary, an ongoing dynamic of steady job and wage growth.\nIn a press conference after the end of a two-day policy meeting, Powell said the better course of action for now, given the uncertainties, was to maintain the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, and see how job and price data evolve between now and the next policy meeting in December.\nRoughly 20 months into the Fed's aggressive tightening of monetary policy, Powell said it remained unclear whether overall financial conditions were yet restrictive enough to tame inflation that he still considers to be far above the central bank's 2% target.\n\"We're not confident that we haven't, we're not confident that we have\" reached that sufficiently restrictive plateau, Powell told reporters. \"Inflation has been coming down, but it's still running well above our 2% target ... A few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence.\"\nAnnual inflation, based on the Fed's preferred measure, was 3.4% in September for the third month in a row. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, it was 3.7%, little changed from August.\nAsked if the Fed maintained a bias towards hiking rates versus keeping policy on hold, Powell responded \"that's the question we're asking. Should we hike more?\"\nMARKET RATES IN FOCUS\nBut the Fed chief also acknowledged that a recent market-driven rise in Treasury bond yields, home mortgage rates and other financing costs could have their own impact on the economy as long as they persist, and Fed officials will be watching those effects closely as they consider whether to hike the central bank's policy rate again.\n\"These higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households and businesses. Those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists,\" Powell said, taking particular note of 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages that are nearing 8%, close to a 25-year high.\nPowell's comments elaborated on a policy decision and statement that, while leaving the Fed's benchmark rate unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, also took stock of what he called the \"outsized\" 4.9% annual pace of U.S. economic growth in the July-September period after a surge of consumer spending.\n\"Economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter,\" the U.S. central bank said in its statement after policymakers unanimously agreed to leave rates unchanged. The language marked an upgrade to the \"solid pace\" of activity the Fed saw as of its September meeting.\nU.S. stocks climbed after the release of the policy statement and closed higher on the day, while the U.S. dollar pared gains and ended flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell and traders of short-term U.S. interest rates added to bets the Fed was done raising its policy rate and would start cutting rates by June of next year.\n\"The statement leans to the dovish side,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. \"The fact that they left rates unchanged for the second time in a row suggests the Fed might leave rates unchanged in December. And if they do, that means the Fed is done.\"\nThough markets think the Fed's rate-hiking campaign may be finished, data pointing to a stronger-than-expected economy and labor market have kept the prospect of another hike on the table.\nPowell noted that much about the economy's recent performance was constructive, with low unemployment and rising wages fueling more demand for goods and services and more job creation - the sort of virtuous cycle that, within bounds, leads to self-sustaining growth.\nThe issue for the Fed is whether conditions remain so robust that progress on inflation stalls or even reverses.\n\"It has been good,\" Powell said. \"We've been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this ... The question is, how long can that continue?\"\nThe odds, he said, are that a slowdown of some sort will be needed, with the Fed committed to finding the policy stance that makes it happen.\n\"It is still likely ... we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market ... to fully restore price stability,\" Powell said.\nHis comments throw the focus onto upcoming employment and inflation data, with the release of the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Friday the first major piece of data that will shape the Fed's deliberations for its December meeting.\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)",

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- UBS Group AG reported stronger-than-expected client inflows in its wealth-management business, boosted by the first signs of stabilization at Credit Suisse as it carries out an expensive and complex integration of its former rival.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWeWork Goes Bankrupt, Signs Pact With Creditors to Cut Debt\nTrump Testimony Called a \u2018Broken Record\u2019 by Judge: Trial Update\nTrump's Wealth Has Jumped $500 Million Since He Left the White House\nS&P 500 Set for Longest Winning Run in Two Years: Markets Wrap\nTrump Shouts at Judge and Lawyers in Wild Day on Witness Stand\nThe unit saw net new money of $22 billion in the third quarter, compared with an estimate of $14 billion. About $3 billion of that was at Credit Suisse\u2019s wealth arm, its first positive client flows in a year and a half.\nThe Zurich-based bank posted a net loss of $785 million for the three months to September, its first quarterly loss in almost six years, as costs to absorb Credit Suisse came in at $2 billion. A further $1 billion of charges are expected to come in the fourth quarter.\nUBS Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti is seeking to chart a path through the biggest merger in finance in decades, readying the combined bank for a strategic revamp due to be announced in February. The bank\u2019s shares have gained by about 30% this year as investors back Ermotti\u2019s plan to integrate Credit Suisse\u2019s profitable businesses while winding down the rest.\nThe bank is in \u201cfull execution mode\u201d around the integration, Ermotti said on a call with analysts.\nUBS shares were up 3.6% at 11:10 a.m in Zurich.\nProfit at the asset management unit came in lower than expected. UBS said ongoing uncertainty over the economic outlook, including central-bank rate increases and geopolitical tensions, may affect wealth-management clients\u2019 willingness to conduct transactions in the fourth quarter.\nInvestment Bank\nUBS reported an increase in investment banking revenues of 36% compared to the same period last year, driven by fees from mergers & acquisitions and leveraged capital markets. In trading, UBS\u2019s revenues for equities decreased 3% from the prior year reflecting a difficult market that contributed to mixed results across Wall Street banks.\nFor its smaller fixed income, rates and currency trading business, UBS\u2019s revenues were down 37% from the prior year, faring much worse than US trading houses.\nUBS has signaled it will shutter roughly two-thirds of Credit Suisse\u2019s investment bank as it absorbs its former rival, including almost all its trading operations as part of plans to exit businesses that don\u2019t fit with its existing strategy.\nUBS said it accelerated the wind-down of assets inherited from Credit Suisse that it doesn\u2019t want to continue, reducing risk-weighted assets by $6.4 billion in the quarter.\nThe Swiss bank has said it will give an update on its share buyback program in February, around the same time as full-year results.\nOn costs, UBS said it had already met its goal for this year of reducing expenses by some $3 billion. Personnel costs jumped however, including some $500 million in retention payments to key Credit Suisse staff.\nUBS is seeking to cut the combined workforce as a way to slash costs. Managed headcount dropped by more than 4,000 in the third quarter and is down by about 13,000 against the total figure the two banks would have had as a combined entity at the end of last year, according to the report.\n\u201cUBS has made clear progress since the close of the deal, but it continues to face a huge task,\u201d said Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Vontobel Holding AG in Zurich.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\nCore UBS flows and momentum in the acquired Credit Suisse business are pivotal for deal success, with an encouraging $3 billion of Credit Suisse wealth net new money in 3Q implying an acceleration to $2 billion in the final month or so of the quarter. That follows $1 billion through Aug. 28, along with $17 billion of wealth-deposit inflows ($7 billion in the final month after $10 billion in the first two months). Combined wealth flows, deposits and Swiss deposits all improved in 3Q. An acceleration of the noncore wind-down is positive, with $1 billion of integration costs expected in 4Q after $2 billion in 3Q.\n\u2014 Alison Williams, BI banking analyst\n--With assistance from Allegra Catelli.\n(Adds Ermotti quote in fifth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nWho\u2019s Ready for a Trump-Biden Rematch?

It's telling us that the Fed is done, there's nothing left for it to do here,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at hedge fund Great Hill Capital at New York.\n\"This is what the Fed was looking for, slowing inflation, slowing labor market and the economy's holding up at the same time.\"\nFollowing the data, traders erased bets the Fed will raise borrowing costs any further and piled into bets on rate cuts starting by May. They are currently pricing in a 100% chance the Fed will hold rates next month, as per CME Group's Fedwatch tool.\nU.S. Treasury yields dropped, with the two-year yield , which best reflects short-term interest rate expectations, sliding to two-week lows.\nThat in turn lifted megacap-growth stocks such as Nvidia , Alphabet, Amazon.com and Tesla up between 1.6% and 4.7%.\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped 4.7% to hit an over six-week high. Rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities that have been hammered this year, rose 5.5% and 3.4%, respectively.\nWall Street's main indexes have seen a strong rebound in November on expectations that U.S. interest rates were near their peak, even as Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week left the door open to further tightening.\nFocus is also on negotiations by U.S. lawmakers over a funding bill as they face an end-of-week deadline to fund the federal government.\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said on Tuesday he thinks the House will pass a short-term spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown beginning on Saturday.\nAt 12:00 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 494.67 points, or 1.44%, at 34,832.54, the S&P 500 was up 80.73 points, or 1.83%, at 4,492.28, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 282.21 points, or 2.05%, at 14,049.95.\nSnap Inc shares jumped 7.7% following news that Amazon.com will allow Snapchat users in the United States to buy some products listed on the ecommerce company directly from the social media app.\nHome Depot gained 6.6% after the U.S. home improvement chain beat quarterly profit estimates.\nFisker slid 22.5% after the electric-vehicle startup slashed its 2023 production forecast.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 11.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.93-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 41 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 101 new lows.

        "text": "\n(Reuters) - U.S. robotaxi operators could face increased regulatory scrutiny after an accident involving Cruise, the self-driving cab business of General Motors, forced the company to pause service.\nIn October, one of Cruise's driverless cabs was not able to stop in time from hitting a pedestrian who had been struck by a hit-and-run driver, raising safety concerns around the use of robotaxis.\nHere's a quick rundown on the sector:\nWhat are robotaxis?\nRobotaxis are autonomous self-driving cabs which require no human interaction to operate the vehicle. The ride-hailing service can be availed through mobile apps.\nHow does it work?\nThe vehicles use machine-learning models and advanced systems to process information from technologies such as cameras and LiDAR sensors, as well as pre-existing data, to navigate around specified areas without a human driver required to make decisions.\nWhen did driverless cabs become a reality?\nAlphabet's Waymo was the first to kick off robotaxis in the United States in 2017.\nCruise followed with its first driverless ride service last year in San Francisco, and slowly expanded to include Phoenix, Arizona, and Austin, Texas.\nCompanies offering the service\nRobotaxi services are currently offered in specific areas within the United States by Waymo, Uber Technologies and Lyft.\nWhile Cruise paused its U.S. services for a safety review, it continues to undertake testing in closed course training environments, along with public testing overseas.\nAmazon.com is also testing its robotaxi service, Zoox, to handle traffic lights, intersections and drive at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour.\nWhen will robotaxis become mainstream?\nWhile robotaxis offer the convenience of lower operating costs for cab operators, there are regulatory approvals and technological hurdles that need to be overcome before the cabs are widely adopted across states.\nLucid's CEO in 2021 said it was likely to take a decade before self-driving taxis would be deployed on roads, and they weren't \"coming anytime soon even with the most advanced sensing systems in the world\".\nThe use of driverless cabs also raises the prospect of job losses and could attract pushback from unions.\nAre robotaxis safer than other cars?\nOn paper, robotaxis are supposed to offer better safety due to their advanced machine-learning models and a host of sensors designed to monitor traffic activity.\nNewer models of the vehicles were also tuned to offer smoother braking and acceleration curves to give passengers a better ride.\nHowever, the unpredictability of human drivers and pedestrians sometimes makes it difficult for the current autonomous driving tech to take quick decisions and navigate around hazards.\nRegulatory hurdles facing robotaxis\nCommercializing fully autonomous vehicles, especially robotaxis, has been harder than expected with tough regulations, complicated technology and heavy investments forcing some to cut jobs.\nSome companies such as Ford and Volkswagen-backed Argo AI have also shut shop.\n(Reporting by Nathan Gomes in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",

        "text": "\n(Reuters) -PricewaterhouseCoopers affiliates in Hong Kong and China and a Chinese audit firm have agreed to pay a total of $7.9 million in fines for failures related to audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, the U.S. accounting watchdog said on Thursday.\nThe penalties come over a year after Beijing and Washington struck a landmark deal that has allowed the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect the books and records of Chinese companies listed in New York for the first time. While the fines are relatively small, they are among the biggest the watchdog has ever issued and indicate that the inspection deal, a decade in the making, is working as hoped.\n\"The days of China-based firms evading accountability are over. The PCAOB is demonstrating that we will take action to protect investors in U.S. markets and impose tough sanctions against anyone who violates PCAOB rules and standards, no matter where they are located,\" said PCAOB chair Erica Williams in a statement.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers firms in Hong Kong and China agreed to pay a total of $7 million for violating quality control standards after they failed to detect or prevent extensive answer-sharing on mandatory training courses, the PCAOB said.\n\"After becoming aware of these issues, the firms investigated these matters promptly and took remedial action,\" the PwC affiliates said in a joint statement, noting they reported the problems to the PCAOB.\nThe PCAOB also fined Shandong Haoxin Certified Public Accountants Co., Ltd. and four accountants $940,000 for violations including issuing a false audit report and failing to maintain independence from a public company client. The individuals are also facing industry bars of varying lengths, the PCAOB said.\nHaoxin did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\nThe U.S. has for years worried that the auditors of U.S.-listed Chinese companies were falling down on the job, putting investors at risk. But Beijing had resisted allowing the PCAOB access to its auditors' records, citing state secrecy concerns.\nIn August 2022, the two countries - spurred on by a new U.S. law that threatened to kick potentially 200 Chinese companies off U.S. exchanges - finally agreed a framework for beginning inspections of eight audits.\nIn May, the PCAOB said it found a slew of deficiencies in audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies performed by PwC in Hong Kong and KPMG. At the time, the watchdog said it was common to find issues when first accessing a country's auditors.\nIt did not disclose which companies' audits it had selected for inspection, but Reuters has previously reported that Alibaba Group Holding and Yum China Holdings were among them.\nThe PCAOB's inspection in the region continue and the regulator continues to have \"complete access\" in its inspections, Williams said on Thursday.\n\"American investors are better protected when the PCAOB can audit the auditors of issuers listed in the United States,\" U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by Michelle Price, Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski)",

The hurdles have come down significantly.\"\nThe Berkshire investment in Mitsubishi and rivals Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsui and Sumitomo has also focused global attention on Japanese stocks in general and coincided with a push by the Tokyo Stock Exchange for improved use of capital that has seen companies boost dividends and buy back shares.\nThe result has put Japanese equities soundly back in fashion for the first time in years, as investors bet that more companies are serious about improving governance and returns.\nThe Nikkei has jumped 29% so far this year, outperforming both the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100. Tellingly, the index has also hit its highest since 1990 - near the peak of the asset bubble when Japan was still a more dominant force in the global economy.\nAttitudes about the need to engage with external stakeholders - including investors - are now changing rapidly in Japan, at least among larger firms, Kobayashi said, highlighting how Japan Inc has become less insular in recent years.\nGOING DIRECT\nMitsubishi is now reaching out directly to overseas investors, something it used to outsource to brokerages. It met with some 100 foreign investors in the past half a year, Kobayashi said, double the number from last year.\n\"We're taking an active targeted marketing approach, particularly towards foreign investors,\" he said.\nAppointed as the trading house's first chief stakeholder engagement officer in April, Kobayashi is now focused on wooing investors who focus on growth, not just value.\nBerkshire, synonymous with the philosophy of value investing that Buffett studied at Columbia University under Benjamin Graham, said in June it increased its stakes to average more than 8.5% in the five trading houses.\nBerkshire first announced roughly 5% stakes in August 2020, with Buffett saying the trading houses \"have many joint ventures throughout the world and are likely to have more\".\nSince then Mitsubishi's share price has more than trebled, when dividends are included, although that's still slightly behind top performer Mitsui, which has returned 237%, according to LSEG data. The Nikkei has returned 54%.\nThe trading houses are \"a cross-section of not only Japan, but of the world\", Buffett told the Nikkei newspaper in April, adding they were \"similar to Berkshire\".\nStill, Mitsubishi is trading at a price-to-book ratio of just a little over 1, or at almost no premium to the value of its assets.\n\"We have yet to make the case for our growth potential to the market,\" Kobayashi said.\n(Reporting by Anton Bridge and Miho Uranaka; Editing by David Dolan and Miral Fahmy)",

Even the costliest state, California, now registers an average price below the $5.00 level, at $4.92, down $0.52 from one month ago.\nThe steady decline is a boon for the Biden administration during a year when consumers have seen the cost of shelter, food, and services go higher. \u201cThe president wants \u2014 specifically as we go into Thanksgiving and then into Christmas and New Year's and the holiday season \u2014 to give the American public and the American family a break.

Hamas said it had handed over 13 Israelis, three Thais and one with Russian citizenship.\nThe release of the hostages - part of a larger group captured when Hamas fighters rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7 - was mirrored by the freeing of 39 Palestinians, all of whom are teenagers, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA.\nHamas said it wanted to extend the truce if serious efforts were made to increase the number of Palestinian detainees released by Israel.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said he hoped the pause in fighting can go on as long as hostages are getting released. He hoped more Americans would be released by Hamas although he did not have firm news.\nBiden said the 4-year-old hostage, Abigail Edan, had witnessed her parents being killed by Hamas fighters during their Oct. 7 raid into Israel and had been held since then.\n\"What she endured is unthinkable,\" Biden said at a news conference in the U.S.\nAbigail was on her way to the hospital for checks, Israel's Channel 13 said. Her grandfather, Carmel Edan, told Reuters he \"simply could not believe\" she had been returned, thanking Biden \"for all the help he's offered us.\"\nPalestinians gave the freed prisoners a jubilant reception in Ramallah, according to WAFA.\nOmar Abdullah Al Hajj, 17, one of the detainees released Sunday, said he'd been kept in the dark about what was happening in the outside world.\n\"I can't believe I'm free now but my joy is incomplete because we still have our brothers who remain in prison, and then there is all the news about Gaza that I am having to learn about now,\" he told Reuters.\nThe four-day truce is the first halt in fighting in the seven weeks since Hamas killed 1,200 people and took about 240 hostages back into Gaza.\nIn response to that attack, Israel has vowed to destroy the Hamas militants who run Gaza, bombarding the enclave and mounting a ground offensive in the north. Some 14,800 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday met security forces inside the Gaza Strip. He also said he spoke to Biden about the hostage release, adding that he would welcome extending a temporary truce if it meant that on every additional day 10 captives would be freed. However Netanyahu said he also told Biden that, at the end of the truce, \"we will return with full force to achieve our goals: The elimination of Hamas, ensuring that Gaza does not return to what it was; and of course the release of all our hostages.\"\nFRAGILE DEAL\nSunday's hostage release follows the liberation of 13 Israelis on Saturday - six of them women and seven of them teenagers or children. The youngest was 3-year-old Yahel Shoham, freed with her mother and brother, although her father remains a hostage.\nIsrael freed 39 Palestinians the same day - six women and 33 teenagers - from two prisons, WAFA said.\nA Palestinian source has said up to 100 hostages could ultimately go free.\nQatar, Egypt and the United States are pressing for the truce to be extended beyond Monday but it is not clear whether that will happen.\nClashes and recriminations have threatened to torpedo the existing deal.\nThe killing of a Palestinian farmer in the central Gaza Strip had earlier added to those concerns. The farmer was killed when targeted by Israeli forces east of Gaza's long-established Maghazi refugee camp, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\nThe armed wing of Hamas also said on Sunday that four of its military commanders in the Gaza Strip had been killed, including the commander of the North Gaza brigade, Ahmad Al Ghandour. It did not say when they had been killed.\nViolence has also flared in the West Bank, where Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians, including two minors and at least one gunman, late on Saturday and early Sunday, medics and local sources said.\nEven before the Oct. 7 attacks from Gaza, the West Bank had been in a state of unrest, with a rise in Israeli army raids, Palestinian attacks, and violence by Israeli settlers in the past 18 months. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7, some in Israeli air strikes.\nIMMENSE RELIEF\nThe deal survived an earlier threat when Hamas' armed wing said on Saturday it was delaying hostage releases until Israel met all truce conditions, including committing to let aid trucks into northern Gaza.\nSaving the truce took a day of diplomacy mediated by Qatar and Egypt, which President Biden also joined.\nHamas' al-Qassam Brigades also said Israel had failed to respect terms for the release of Palestinian prisoners that factored in their time in detention.\nCOGAT, the Israeli agency for civilian coordination with the Palestinians, accused Hamas itself of delaying trucks trying to deliver humanitarian aid to northern Gaza at a checkpoint.\n\"To Hamas, residents of Gaza are their last priority,\" it said on Sunday.\nQatari diplomats are now on site in Gaza to supervise the entry and delivery of their country's aid, Qatar's Foreign Ministry said.\nA U.N. official who took part in a humanitarian convoy to northern Gaza said on Sunday aid groups were on track\nto deliver the biggest shipment in over a month\n, describing thin, gaunt residents slaking their thirst as soon as water arrived.\n\"People are so desperate and you can see in adults' eyes they haven't eaten,\" the U.N. children's agency's James Elder told Reuters by video link from southern Gaza after returning from Gaza City.\n\"There's just this immense relief. Literally people as they get water start drinking the water immediately,\" he said. \"They're thirsty. They've been thirsty for days.\"\nEven as the aid deliveries flowed north, Elder said he saw hundreds of Gazans heading in the other direction, fearing the renewal of Israeli bombardments if the four-day truce is not prolonged.\n\"People are so terrified that this pause won't be continued,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Emily Rose, Emma Farge, Bassam Masoud, James Mackenzie, Aidan Lewis, Ari Rabinovitch, Adam Makary, Nidal al-Mugrabi and Moaz Abd-Alaziz; Additional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah, Nafisa Eltahir in Cairo, Andy Sullivan in Washington, Moira Warburton; Writing by Raphael Satter, Keith Weir and Giles Elgood; Editing by Angus MacSwan, Nick Macfie, Louise Heavens, David Gregorio and Diane Craft)",

        "text": "\nBy Ankur Banerjee\nSINGAPORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the back foot on Friday, while the euro nursed steep losses as traders weighed data that showed inflation was easing, stoking expectations that interest rates had peaked and central banks would soon start cutting rates.\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was 0.145% lower at 103.30, after clocking its weakest monthly performance in a year in November, despite a 0.6% jump overnight.\nData on Thursday showed U.S. consumer spending rose moderately in October, while the annual increase in inflation was the smallest in more than 2-1/2 years.\nThe eagerly awaited personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 3% in October from a year ago, moderating from a three-month string of 3.4% readings though still above the Fed's 2% target.\n\"While the 3% level remains too high to declare victory on inflation, it marks a new low for the series that will likely please the Fed and alleviate any pressure to implement further hikes,\" said Ryan Brandham, head of global capital markets, North America, at Validus Risk Management.\n\"It remains to be seen if getting from 3% to 2% will be easy, or if inflation will remain sticky in 2024.\"\nFederal Reserve policymakers signalled on Thursday that the U.S. central bank's interest rate hikes are likely over, but left the door open to further monetary policy tightening should progress on inflation stall.\nMarkets are pricing in a 97% chance of the Fed standing pat in its December meeting, the CME FedWatch tool showed, with a 42% chance of a rate cut in March next year compared with a 27% chance last week.\nInvestor focus will now move to comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell later on Friday, with traders likely to scrutinize every word to sketch out rate outlook.\n\"We expect Powell to reiterate the possibility of further tightening and dampen expectations of rate cuts, said Carol Kong, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\"Further loosening of financial conditions may undermine the FOMC\u2019s efforts to tame inflation pressures. That said, we do not expect the FOMC to tighten policy again.\"\nOver in Europe, data on Thursday showed Euro zone inflation tumbled more than expected for a third straight month in November, fuelling bets of early spring rate cuts despite the European Central Bank's explicit guidance.\nThe euro was up 0.13% at $1.0902, having slipped 0.7% on Thursday after the inflation data. The single currency is down 0.3% for the week. Sterling was last at $1.2643, up 0.17% on the day.\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.31% to 147.73 per dollar, on course for its third straight week of gains against the dollar, pulling it away from the near 33-year low of 151.92 it touched in the middle of November.\nFormer top Japanese finance ministry bureaucrat and senior central banker Toshiro Muto said on Thursday that chances were high for the Bank of Japan to scrap both negative interest rates and yield control as early as April when annual wage talks confirm the scope of pay hikes.\nThe Australian dollar rose 0.20% to $0.662, while the New Zealand dollar rose 0.37% to $0.618.\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore.

        "text": "\nBy David Gaffen\n(Reuters) - A broad swath of global industrial and consumer bellwethers reported stronger-than-expected earnings in their most recent quarter, as resilient spending patterns kept profits afloat despite high interest rates.\nGiants like Coca-Cola, General Electric and Novartis exceeded expectations on Tuesday as reporting season picked up steam, with major technology companies on deck to report in coming days. Broadly, companies say demand has held up, belying long-held expectations for a recession that has yet to materialize.\nThrough Tuesday morning, 81% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported results have beat expectations, compared with an average of 67% since 1994. About one-quarter of S&P companies have released results and are surpassing analysts' forecasts by more than 7%, far above the historic average, according to LSEG I/B/E/S data.\nBoth Coca-Cola and industrial conglomerate 3M raised their full-year outlooks. Telecom company Verizon said it brought in more subscribers than expected as it also raised its forecast for free cash flow.\nIn Europe, Swiss companies Novartis and Logitech International both raised their full-year earnings forecast after reporting strong results. Luxury apparel maker Hermes said sales were up briskly in the third quarter.\nEuropean earnings reports are not as far along as in the U.S. So far, 50 companies in the EuroStoxx 600 have posted results, with 54% ahead of estimates, in line with the typical average, according to LSEG I/B/E/S.\nU.S. automaker General Motors reported a 5.4% increase in revenue and said its average vehicle selling price was $50,750 in the most recent quarter, down slightly from the previous quarter.\n\"So far the consumer has held up remarkably well for us as evidenced by the average transaction prices,\" said Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer at GM. As for rising interest rates, he said \"it's something we're mindful of but not something we're seeing in the immediate market for our vehicles.\"\nIn recent days the U.S. Treasury benchmark 10-year note yield touched 5% for the first time in 16 years as the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised short-term borrowing rates to slow the economy and rein in inflation.\nLast week Elon Musk, CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla, noted the increase in borrowing costs, saying it would directly affect sales as people need credit to buy cars. GM's Jacobson said rates were a concern as well, but also said spending was holding up.\n3M CEO Michael Roman said back-to-school spending was less robust than in previous years. \"We're just looking at the uncertainty around what happens for the holiday season,\" he said, adding that the shift from discretionary spending into staples like food has continued.\nSo far the rise in interest rates has not hurt the labor market, where unemployment remains at a still-low 3.8%. Housing purchases, dependent on affordable mortgages, have slowed, and the equity market has been stagnant, having lost 6.5% in the last three months, with the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio dipping to 17.7, lower than the last few months.\n\"That 5% number on the 10-year is eye-catching, and that's why equities have stalled out here, but historically speaking 5% hasn't been horrible for valuation,\" said Robert Teeter, managing director of Silvercrest Asset Management, which has $31.9 billion under management.\n(Reporting by David Gaffen; Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "text": "\nBy Howard Schneider\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Federal Reserve officials agreed at their last policy meeting that they would proceed \"carefully\" and only raise interest rates if progress in controlling inflation faltered, the minutes of the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 gathering showed on Tuesday.\n\"All participants agreed that the Committee was in a position to proceed carefully,\" according to the minutes, which appeared to show support for more rate hikes dissipating within the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, and the baseline shifting to one in which its benchmark overnight interest rate remains steady absent a bad inflation surprise.\nInflation has been slowing - consumer prices did not rise at all on a month-to-month basis in October - and while the Fed has not declared its fight against rapid price increases over, the tenor of the discussion has been shifting towards a focus on how long to keep the policy rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range.\n\"Participants noted that further tightening of monetary policy would be appropriate if incoming information indicated that progress toward the Committee's inflation objective was insufficient,\" said the minutes, a statement that indicated it will take an unexpected shock of some degree to prompt a further rate increase.\nThat sentence did not appear in the minutes of the Fed's prior meeting in September, when \"a majority of participants\" still judged that another rate increase would be needed in a tightening cycle that has pushed the policy rate 5.25 percentage points higher in the past 20 months.\nThe latest policy meeting readout, by contrast, said that \"all participants judged it appropriate to maintain\" the current rate setting, a stance that will be clarified at the Fed's Dec. 12-13 meeting when policymakers issue a new set of detailed projections for interest rates and the economy.\nThe document drew little reaction in financial markets, largely affirming the view that the Fed is done raising rates but won't explicitly say so until more officials become convinced inflation won't rebound.\nContracts tied to the federal funds rate continued to show a near-zero probability of further increases. Odds of a rate cut at the Fed's April 30-May 1, 2024 meeting rose slightly to roughly 60%, from about 57% before the release of the minutes, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\nU.S. stocks added slightly to losses and closed lower following the release of the minutes, while the U.S. dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields slipped.\nThe minutes showed U.S. central bank policymakers wrestling with conflicting economic signals that have made risks to the economy \"more two-sided,\" with rekindled inflation still a concern, but worries as well about clamping down on credit too far and damaging the economy's prospects.\nU.S. economic growth had just registered an outsized 4.9% annualized gain in the third quarter, a seemingly inflationary pace. But financial markets had driven interest rates higher for households, businesses and the U.S. government, threatening to curb economic and job growth more than might be necessary to return inflation to the Fed's 2% target.\n\"Participants commented on the significant tightening in financial conditions in recent months, driven by higher longer-term yields,\" the minutes said.\nStill, inflation \"remained well above\" the central bank's target, likely requiring Fed policy \"to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation is clearly moving down sustainably.\"\n\"The overall tone of the FOMC minutes was cautiously hawkish - the commitment to remaining in restrictive territory for 'some time' was the clearest takeaway,\" said Ian Lyngen, strategist with BMO Capital Markets.\nNO VICTORY DECLARATION\nFed Chair Jerome Powell had made liberal use of the \"careful\" concept at his last press conference in describing the central bank's efforts to balance still-elevated inflation with a sense the economy was about to slow.\nThere's good reason to be cautious, with the Fed possibly on the verge of pulling off the unexpected by navigating out of the worst inflationary surge in 40 years without doing major damage to the economy.\nA New York Fed staff study released on Tuesday suggested in fact that the U.S. central bank's late start in raising interest rates, with the first hike coming a year after prices began a sharp rise, allowed the economy to bank more growth with the same progress on lowering inflation than would have been the case if rate increases had started sooner.\nThere's little appetite among policymakers, however, to declare victory yet, or to give investors much direct guidance about what will happen next.\n\"Inflation has given us a few head fakes. If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so,\" Powell said at an International Monetary Fund research conference earlier this month. \"We will continue to move carefully, however, allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of over-tightening.\"\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Additional reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir and Michael S.

One way is to use public companies to incur debt,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe better approach would be to try and set up a new fund and anchor it in the constitution.\u201d\nThat would require Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s coalition to find support from opposition lawmakers \u2014 as it did when setting up a fund for the country\u2019s military after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Fuest said that may not be possible in the short term, \u201cbut maybe after negotiations.\u201d\nThe government will suspend the constitutional borrowing limit for this year after the court ruling forced Finance Minister Christian Lindner to retroactively account for at least \u20ac37 billion ($40.4 billion) of debt earmarked to ease the burden of high electricity and gas prices on households and companies.\nThe Nov. 15 judgment in Karlsruhe against a climate transition facility has called into question hundreds of billions of euros of financing in the government\u2019s special funds \u2014 some of them decades old \u2014 that are not part of the regular federal budget.\nBloomberg Economics estimates that the situation could reduce economic growth by 0.5% next year as it casts doubt over several large investment projects.\nFor Fuest, the worst-case scenario would materialize if the budget hole is \u201cfilled by spending cuts and tax increases,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would have a very negative impact on growth. It could put Germany back into recession in the coming year.\u201d\n\u201cMy main scenario would be that the government manages to find other solutions so that yes, there is uncertainty which will dampen growth a little bit,\u201d according to Fuest. \u201cI think we will see growth, albeit rather weak growth \u2014 something between maybe a half percent and 1%.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

With 40% of mortgage holders already seeing their shorter-duration mortgages renew at higher interest rates, Rogers said officials are watching how households adjust.\n\u201cBy the end of 2026, virtually all remaining mortgage holders will go through a renewal cycle and, depending on the path for interest rates, may face significantly higher payments.\u201d\nRead More: Bank of Canada\u2019s Rogers Urges Shift by Banks on Mortgage Lending\nIn the next two years 45% of all outstanding mortgages may be forced to contend with higher rates as they renew or reset, according to a report released Thursday by the Canada Mortgage & Housing Corporation. If rates remain at current levels, borrowers will be collectively on the hook for C$15 billion ($10.9 billion) in extra interest payments each year.\nRogers said banks and financial institutions are keeping bigger capital and liquidity buffers, and are putting more cash aside as a \u201cproactive adjustment\u201d to contend with possible credit losses.\nWhile Rogers made clear her comments weren\u2019t meant to be predictive in terms of the path for the Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight rate, the speech also adds to evidence policymakers increasingly see borrowing costs as less restrictive. The bank held its key rate at 5% for the second straight meeting in October, citing mounting evidence of a slowing economy despite increased inflation risks.\nSpeaking to lawmakers last week, Governor Tiff Macklem said the neutral rate \u2014 the theoretical level of interest rates that is neither restrictive nor stimulative \u2014 was probably drifting higher, and he admitted he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the bank\u2019s decision to leave the range for the neutral rate between 2% and 3% in their annual review earlier this year.\nFormer Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told BNN Bloomberg Television that while borrowing costs are likely to normalize lower, it doesn\u2019t mean interest rates will go back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still going to require a major rethink of how much debt you can carry, whether you\u2019re a company or whether you\u2019re a household,\u201d Poloz said.\n--With assistance from Ari Altstedter and Sandra Mergulhao.\n(Adds details from CMHC report and Poloz interview starting in paragraph nine.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Provisions for losses on impaired loans climbed C$259 million. CIBC\u2019s earnings have previously been dented by a surge in impairments in the bank\u2019s US office loan portfolio.\nCIBC\u2019s stock performance tends to be closely correlated to the broader outlook for the Canadian housing market, according to analysts.

Stocks jump, bond yields fall, and a dash ensues among equity speculators into shady corners encompassing everything from meme fliers to crypto and profitless tech.\nThat\u2019s November in a nutshell. Volatility has fallen to pre-pandemic lows and a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gauge of global risk appetite has hit near the highest level in two years. Yet events in June and July \u2014 marked by another all-encompassing rally that gave way to a 10% correction \u2014 provide sinister parallels.\nCould this time be different? Perhaps. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushed back Friday on the prospects for interest-rate cuts, the central bank\u2019s historic tightening campaign is seen as game over across markets. At the same time, the risk-on exuberance is working against Powell\u2019s goal of tightening financial conditions, a back-and-forth dynamic that has contributed to the demise of past rallies.\n\u201cThe shifting narratives have been swinging markets far more than is warranted by fundamentals \u2014 in both directions,\u201d Dan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant shifting back and forth between oversold and overbought conditions.\u201d\nAs always, extreme moves in markets are eliciting warnings about their sustainability. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said in an episode of The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations that economic optimism may be misplaced \u2014 unless the Fed starts easing a lot sooner than many investors expect. He cited the impact of so-called real rates, noting that as inflation recedes they effectively rise and threaten the business cycle.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a real risk of a hard landing if the Fed doesn\u2019t start cutting rates pretty soon,\u201d said Ackman, noting that he\u2019s seen evidence of a weakening economy.\nBy almost any measure, November\u2019s advance was a huge one. Plunging Treasury yields set the stage for powerful rallies in stocks, credit and emerging markets. The Bloomberg 60/40 index saw one of its best months on record. Indexes tracking crypto, meme stocks, initial public offerings and unprofitable tech \u2014 all of which struggled when yields were soaring \u2014 surged big time. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARKK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) gained a record 31%, its best month on record.\n\u201cOptimism that the Fed\u2019s next move is going to be a rate cut, optimism that the US economy is going to avoid a hard landing \u2014 they\u2019re strong drivers, and it has been a tremendous pivot,\u201d Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, said by phone. \u201cCould we see a hangover in January? Potentially, if the Fed does stick to the higher-for-longer narrative.\u201d\nThe forceful rally comes at a delicate time. While a parade of data this week fortified bulls \u2014 from jobless claims to gross domestic product and consumer confidence \u2014 it remains unclear whether the retreat in inflation portends a more lasting economic slowdown. On Friday, the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index come in below expectations, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow index saw its estimate for US fourth-quarter growth ease to 1.19%.\nAlong with all the economic uncertainty investors are also contending with dicey market dynamics that were also present over the summer, namely the outsize role of seven tech superstocks in propelling the lion\u2019s share of the wins. Even with a slight broadening in November, the top five contributors account for 68% of the index\u2019s gain this year, and the top 10 make up 90% of the return.\nSuch narrow leadership is typical before a slowdown, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., which says equity concentration has reached levels not seen since 1970s.\n\u201cEquities are now richly valued with volatility near the historical low, while geopolitical and political risks remain elevated. We expect lackluster global earnings growth with downside for equities from current levels,\u201d wrote JPMorgan strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas.\n--With assistance from Emily Graffeo.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAnduril Builds a Tiny, Reusable Fighter Jet That Blows Up Drones\nB-School Admissions Deans Are Feeling The Pressure From Falling Applications\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

        "text": "\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 More than 120 suspected victims of job scams have been rescued after being stranded by fighting in northern Myanmar between the military and armed ethnic groups, Malaysia's government said.\nThe number of Malaysians rescued surged from an initial 26 to 127 in the past few days, Foreign Minister Zambry Abd Kadir told local media late Monday before flying to New York.\nHe said they are in a safe location and the government hoped to fly them home by Thursday. The foreign ministry earlier said the group were stranded in Laukkaing, a town known as a notorious hub for online scams, gambling and other major organized crimes.\nFighting has continued in northern Myanmar after an alliance of armed ethnic minority groups launched a surprise offensive last month. They have seized control of several border crossings to China, in a major disruption to trade.\nZambry said the ministry was asked to help evacuate an Indonesian and a Hong Kong citizen from the area. He said the duo will be flown out with the Malaysians. He thanked China and Myanmar authorities for their help in the operation but didn't give further details.\nA government official who declined to be named as he isn't authorized to speak to the media said Tuesday that based on initial information, the 127 Malaysians were lured to the area by fraud job offers. He said details of the rescue operation and their evacuation couldn't be released yet due to the sensitivity of the case and the various parties involved.\nEarlier this month, 266 Thai victims of human traffickers, several Filipinos and a Singaporean were also rescued from Laukkaing and taken to China's Kunming city, where they boarded chartered flights to Bangkok. Another group of 41 Thais were also reportedly repatriated across the land border.\nUnrest in Myanmar\u2019s border region has been a constant irritant to China, despite its support for the country's military rulers who took power in a takeover in 2021.\nBeijing earlier this week called for a cease-fire in Myanmar but said it will continue live-firing drills on its side of the frontier to prepare for any emergency. Chinese police have reportedly fired tear gas to drive away people who were sheltering close to the border fence.\nChina is highly wary of conflicts spilling over the border that is already rife with drug trafficking and people smuggling. Cybercrime targeting Chinese victims has become a major concern, and China has pushed hard to eliminate the groups based in Myanmar and other countries and to send the perpetrators back to China for prosecution.",

The six-point fall is the fourth-straight drop in builder confidence, leaving the index at its lowest since December 2022.\nConfidence could improve in coming months, however, as mortgage rates that peaked near 8% last month look poised to decline and credit conditions loosen across the economy.\n\"While builder sentiment was down again in November, recent macroeconomic data point to improving conditions for home construction in the coming months,\" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. \"In particular, the 10-year Treasury rate moved back to the 4.5% range for the first time since late September, which will help bring mortgage rates close to or below 7.5%. Given the lack of existing home inventory, somewhat lower mortgage rates will price-in housing demand and likely set the stage for improved builder views of market conditions in December.\"\nThe average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 7.61% last week after climbing to as high as 7.9% in October, the highest in more than two decades, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. A separate survey from Freddie Mac showed the average rate was down to 7.5% in the latest week.\nAs high rates cut into home affordability, homebuilders have slashed prices in an effort to attract buyers.\nHomebuilder confidence rose during the first-half of the year as high mortgage rates and limited inventory of existing homes drew prospective homeowners to the new construction market. NAHB's buyer traffic index reached its peak in July at 40 and fell to 21 in November, the lowest since December 2022.\nAmid weakening traffic, 36% of builders cut home prices in November, the highest share since November 2022.

        "text": "\nLegendary investor and polymath Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman and Warren Buffett's right-hand man and friend of nearly six decades, died on Tuesday in California, the company announced. He was 99.\nTogether, Buffett and Munger built Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) into one of the most successful and long-lasting business partnerships that enthralled millions worldwide.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Buffett said, \"Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation.\"\nBerkshire, originally a textile manufacturer, has grown into a multinational conglomerate that wholly owns popular brands like Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom and has stakes in Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO), and other large public companies.\nEvery year, thousands of Berkshire shareholders make the pilgrimage to Omaha, Neb., to listen to Buffett and Munger answer their questions for hours. Munger, known for his maxims about business, investing, and life, would sip Coca-Colas and nibble See's Candies peanut brittle alongside his partner.\nFamously, he would often say, after Buffett finished speaking, \"I have nothing further to add.\"\nCharles Thomas Munger was born on Jan. 1, 1924, in Omaha, Neb. He grew up in the Dundee neighborhood, a half a block from Buffett\u2019s house, and attended the same high school as the investing legend. He even worked at Buffett\u2019s grandfather\u2019s grocery store as a teenager, though the pair wouldn\u2019t meet until later at the ages of 35 and 29, respectively. When they did finally meet, they became instant friends and partners.\nAt the age of 17, Munger enrolled in the University of Michigan to study mathematics only to drop out at the age of 19 during World War II to serve in the US Army Air Corps. While in the Army, he studied meteorology at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif., which became his home.\nAfter the Army, Munger chose to study law, a \"natural course of activity\" for him given that his father was an attorney and his grandfather was a federal judge.\nWhen Munger applied to Harvard Law School he was initially rejected. He applied again and received his J.D. from Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1948. After law school, Munger returned to Los Angeles where he practiced real estate law.\nAfter his father died in 1959, Munger returned to Omaha to sort out his affairs. While there, Munger ate lunch at the Omaha Club with friends who invited Buffett along. The lunch sparked an instant friendship and one of the most important business partnerships ever forged.\nIn 1962, Munger started an investment partnership. He also started a law firm, Munger Tolles, but stopped practicing law a few years later to focus on investing.\nBuffett credited Munger for breaking his \"cigar-butt\" investing habit, a strategy the investor learned from Benjamin Graham of finding companies at bargain prices and getting \"free puffs\" out of them.\nWhile that strategy worked well in Buffett\u2019s early days of managing much smaller sums of money, Munger \"set the course for building a business that would combine huge satisfactory profits,\" according to an account of Berkshire\u2019s history written by Buffett himself.\n\u201c[Charlie\u2019s] most important architectural feat was the design of today\u2019s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices,\u201d Buffett wrote.\nBuffett also learned the importance of knowing one\u2019s circle of competence from Munger.\n\"Ben Graham taught me a way to value certain type of business, but the selection of variable companies dried up. Charlie taught me about durable competitive advantage \u2014 not how big circle of competence is, but knowing where the edges are most important,\" Buffett said at the 2010 annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting.\nMunger often spoke of the importance of understanding \"the edge\" of one's competence \u2014 in other words, knowing what you don\u2019t know.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a hugely important thing, knowing the edge. It\u2019s hardly a competence if you don\u2019t know the edge of it. You know, if you have a misapprehension regarding your own competency that means you lack competence, you\u2019re going to make terrible mistakes. I think you\u2019ve got to constantly measure what you achieve against other people of achievement, and you have to keep being determinedly rational, and avoiding a lot of self-delusion,\u201d Munger said at the 2019 Daily Journal meeting.\nIn a 1985 shareholder letter, Buffett said Munger \u201chas always emphasized the study of mistakes rather than successes, both in business and other aspects of life.\u201d\nMunger \u201cdoes so in the spirit of the man who said: \u2018All I want to know is where I\u2019m going to die so I\u2019ll never go there.\u2019 You\u2019ll immediately see why we make a good team: Charlie likes to study errors and I have generated ample material for him, particularly in our textile insurance businesses,\u201d Buffett wrote.\nTo make better decisions in business and life, Munger often deployed what he called a \u201clatticework\u201d of mental models.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have models in your head. And you\u2019ve got to array your experience \u2014 both vicarious and direct \u2014 on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You\u2019ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head,\u201d Munger said during a 1994 speech at USC\u2019s business school.\nOne of those famed mental models is a phenomenon Munger coined the \"lollapalooza effect\" in a 1995 speech. At the 2018 Daily Journal meeting, Munger said he came up with the term after reading the main textbooks in introductory psychology and \u201cof course, being Charlie Munger, I decided the psychologists were doing it all wrong and I could do it better.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the ideas I came up with, which wasn\u2019t in any of the books, was that the 'lollapalooza effects' came when three or four of these tendencies were operating at once in the same situation. I can see that it wasn\u2019t linear,\u201d Munger said.\nMunger was also passionate about architecture, a field in which he had no formal training. He developed luxury beachfront homes in Montecito, Calif., nicknamed \"Mungerville.\" He also designed college dormitories and his own home.\n\"I think a life properly lived is just learn, learn, learn all the time. I think Berkshire has gained enormously from these investment decisions by learning for a long period,\" Munger said at Berkshire's 2017 annual meeting.\nBeyond the investment success, Buffett has repeatedly said that Munger made him \u201ca better person.\u201d\n\u201cPeople find this hard to believe, but in 60 years, we\u2019ve never had an argument. We have disagreed about things and we\u2019ll probably keep occasionally disagreeing about this or that, but if you define an argument where emotion starts entering into it or anger or anything of the sort it just doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t happen,\" Buffett said at the 2019 annual meeting.\nMunger encountered his fair share of hardship in life. His first marriage to Nancy Huggins ended in divorce. A year later, his 8-year-old son died of leukemia. Munger also lost his eye after a botched cataract surgery.\nMunger\u2019s second marriage to Nancy Barry lasted 54 years until his wife\u2019s death in 2010. When asked about relationship advice and finding a good spouse, Munger said, \u201cThe best single way is to deserve a good spouse.\u201d\nMunger often said the secret to a long and happy life is \"simple.\"\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of envy, you don\u2019t have a lot of resentment, you don\u2019t overspend your income. You stay cheerful in spite of your troubles. You deal with reliable people, and you do what you\u2019re supposed to. All these simple rules work so well to make your life better, and they\u2019re so trite.\u201d\nJulia La Roche was formerly a Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.\nRead more insights from longtime Berkshire Hathaway chairman Charlie Munger:\nCharlie Munger on AI: 'I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well'\nBillionaire Charlie Munger on Costco stock: 'I'm a total addict'\nCharlie Munger: 'I'm not proud of my country' for allowing 'crypto sh-t'\nCharlie Munger on Robinhood stock crash: 'God is getting just'\nMunger on market swings: 'As Kipling said, treat those two imposters just the same'\nCharlie Munger on journalism: 'We have suffered a huge loss here'\nCharlie Munger on Activision Blizzard: 'I like Bobby Kotick a lot'\nApple is 'ungodly well-managed,' Berkshire's Charlie Munger says\nMeme stock trading is \u2018like a drunken brawl': Charlie Munger\n'The first rule of a happy life,\u2019 according to 97-year-old Charlie Munger\nCharlie Munger explains the best career strategy 'for the great mass of humanity'\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

The rest will come from investors, bank loans and government subsidies, they said.\nThe foundry, to be built in Miyagi prefecture, will begin with mature 40nm and 55nm semiconductors, focus on automotive chips and power controllers and will go online in 2027, the companies said. Japan, home to Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., is a heavy user of such chips, produced by the likes of Tokyo-based Renesas Electronics Corp.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made preparations to create an unbeatable foundry and build a semiconductor ecosystem,\u201d SBI Chief Executive Officer Yoshitaka Kitao said at a news conference Tuesday. SBI will pay for around \u00a5100 billion of the initial investment and seek another \u00a5100 billion through a new fund it plans to set up, but will not build a foundry without subsidies, he added.\nSBI shares rose 2.7%, while Powerchip shares fell 0.2%.\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s administration is paying billions of dollars in subsidies to chipmakers moving production to Japan. Spurred by the financial support, Powerchip\u2019s bigger rival and industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is building a factory in southern Japan, to go online next year.\nUS memory maker Micron Technology Inc. and domestic players Kioxia Holdings Corp. and Rapidus Corp. are also expanding production in the world\u2019s third-largest economy, helped by government support.\n\u201cThe automotive chips that Powerchip will focus on are precisely the kind of chips used in vehicles today and will help secure this production base,\u201d Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said at a regular press conference ahead of the investment announcement. \u201cWe want to secure the supplementary budget necessary to strengthen our semiconductor supply chain.\u201d\nJapan, which wants to claw back its former leadership in chips, is benefiting from a shift in global supply chains as manufacturers seek to lower reliance on Taiwan and hedge against rising US-China tensions. The US is also offering incentives to chipmakers building American capacity, but progress has been slow.\nJapan is \u201cthe best place\u201d for semiconductor investment, Powerchip Chairman Frank Huang said.\nWith so much capacity coming online in Japan, it remains unclear how companies will be able to secure enough engineering talent, given a weak yen.\nPowerchip\u2019s move comes as the chip sector fights to regain its footing from a sharp post-pandemic drop in demand.

For now, users must join a waitlist to get switched on, but the service aims to be immediately available starting in 2024.\nAt a time when retail investors\u2019 enthusiasm for stocks has cooled, Vlad Tenev, Robinhood\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, says he wants to shake up the UK market.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to help lower fees for all customers in the UK, just like we did in the US back in 2019, right before Covid,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg News.\nHe\u2019s offering 5% interest on uninvested cash, trading outside of market hours, as well as zero trading commission or currency fees to local users with as little as $1 to invest.\nWith its sleek, game-like app, Robinhood\u2019s rising popularity with first-time investors helped drive established US brokerages to slash their commissions for online trades to zero.\nBut as the company grew, it faced increasing scrutiny from regulators who\u2019ve accused it of enticing some customers to take on more risk that they could manage. During the pandemic, the company took a starring role in the subreddit-driven short squeeze on shares like GamesStop Corp, that ultimately left a raft of large US hedge funds bruised.\nRead More: Robinhood, Meme Stocks and Investing as a Game: QuickTake\nThe pioneer of commission-free trading apps has had the UK in its sights since 2019 \u2014 most recently via the now-scrapped acquisition of London-based crypto trading firm Ziglu.\nThe company will be joining an increasingly crowded market, competing with locals like Revolut and Freetrade as well as New York-based rival Public.com, which expanded to the UK in July.\nRead More: Robinhood Shares Fall on Revenue Miss as Crypto Volumes Tumble\nTenev said Robinhood\u2019s infrastructure and experience in the US give it an edge.\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve built this platform from the ground up and we\u2019re a technology company and financial services, not a brick and mortar institution, I think makes us more able to expand internationally in ways that traditional financial institutions can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nThe company also plans to start offering crypto trading in the European Union over the coming weeks.\nIn the US, Robinhood makes part of its revenue through payment for order flow, a controversial practice, which was banned in the UK, where market makers pay brokerages to route orders through them, rather than directly to stock exchanges.\n\u201cThe goal for the UK is to take advantage of all the other ways we have of generating revenue, sans payment for order flow,\u201d Tenev said. \u201cAnd because we\u2019re leveraging the same platform that we have in the US that we\u2019re building to be applicable globally, the incremental costs of servicing each new market should be low.\u201d\nRobinhood\u2019s transaction-based revenues fell 11% in the third quarter compared with the prior year to $185 million, largely due to lower crypto volumes, which tumbled 55% on the year. The company\u2019s shares are up about 10% this year, but still 90% lower than their peak.\nRobinhood has diversified its sources of revenue through various products such as securities lending and its premium paid account, Robinhood Gold, which offers additional features. Tenev said the firm was working on launching a credit card in the US.\nAs well as stocks, Robinhood offers its 23 million US customers trading in exchange-traded funds and cryptocurrencies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

It also comes with a $60-a-month subscription called Astro Secure, which Amazon says allows the robot to patrol areas on its own.\nSince Amazon first unveiled the Astro in 2021, the company has promised a Jetsons-like vision of robots handling household tasks. The $1,600 wheeled device sports a flat screen and periscope camera, and can respond to Alexa voice commands. But Amazon has been slow to ship the robot in large quantities, and it\u2019s remained a niche product that many consumers don\u2019t even know about.\nRead More: Amazon\u2019s Astro Home Robot Is Elusive Six Months After Debut\nWith the new version, Amazon may have a clearer application: helping businesses keep an eye on their premises. Though the robot\u2019s hardware is similar to the original model, it can patrol 5,000 square feet (465 square meters), up from 3,500 on the consumer version.\nThe offering is part of a growing range of Amazon security services, an area that\u2019s become a key focus since the company bought the Ring smart doorbell maker in 2018. Amazon is selling a $20-a-month Ring Protect Pro feature for storing security footage and a $99-per-month option that can call emergency services if an issue is detected.\nTaken together, the services will run about $180 a month \u2014 on top of an Astro price tag that will set businesses back thousands of dollars. That represents a particularly ambitious attempt by Amazon\u2019s hardware division to generate more recurring revenue.\nAmazon began testing some of the security services last year on the existing Astro. The increased mapping area required additional storage and memory capacity, necessitating the price increase, the Seattle-based company said. The robot\u2019s user experience also has been tailored to businesses.\nAmazon is seeking to recoup years of investment in Astro\u2019s development. Bloomberg first reported that the bot was in the works back in 2018, and the product was once pitched internally as a major initiative. But Amazon has become famous for killing off once-cherished projects, and Astro will likely need to become a steady seller or risk being discontinued.\nIt\u2019s been a tumultuous year for Amazon\u2019s devices business, and many top leaders who championed the Astro have left the company. Amazon recently hired Panos Panay, Microsoft Corp.\u2019s former chief product officer, as its new executive in charge of devices and Alexa.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High\nThe Impact and Cost of Musk\u2019s Endorsement of Antisemitism on X\nInflation Raging in Triple Digits Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nSHENGJIN, Albania (AP) \u2014 When the leaders of Albania and Italy announced a contentious agreement earlier this week to jointly process some asylum applications of migrants arriving by sea, some in the Western Balkans country saw it as reciprocation.\nItaly had welcomed thousands of Albanians fleeing poverty after the fall of communism more than three decades ago, and Albania's current government wanted to pay back the Italians' hospitality.\nOn Monday, Albania said it agreed to shelter thousands of migrants while Rome fast-tracks their requests seeking asylum in Italy, up to 36,000 a year. A memorandum between the countries says Italy would agree to remove migrants whose applications are rejected. The European Commission has requested more details.\nThe deal, which must be approved by Albania's parliament, already has been criticized by rights organizations and other groups, and it could backfire against Albania as it aspires to EU membership. Italy's left-wing opposition parties are protesting the deal.\nMeanwhile, ordinary Albanians are divided.\nBib Lazri, 66, a resident of the northern Albanian village of Gjader, where one of two accommodation centers is set to be built, said he welcomed the move given the historical ties between the two countries.\n\u201cAll my kids are abroad. They (the Italians) have welcomed us for 30 years now,\u201d Lazri said. \u201cIt is up to us to say a good word, to keep them and show our open heart.\u201d\nIn 1991, around 20,000 Albanians came on one dangerously overcrowded ship that reached the southeastern Italian region of Puglia. It was less than a year since political pluralism was announced in Albania, which for decades under communism had been closed to much of the world, and only months after the first democratic election.\nPoverty was widespread and basic goods, including bread, were in short supply. Albanians saw Italy as their \u201cWestern window.\u201d Many of the Albanians settled in Italy, obtained work and raised families.\nAlbanian Prime Minister Edi Rama announced the five-year deal on Monday in Rome standing beside Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni. Rama expressed gratitude on behalf of Albanians who found refuge in Italy, and \u201cescaped hell and imagined a better life.\u201d\nBut for many other Albanians, confusion and even anger is the main feeling for the surprise announcement.\nAlbania will offer two facilities, starting with the port of Shengjin, a main tourist spot about 75 kilometers (46 miles) south of the capital Tirana that has attracted almost 1 million tourists this year in the surrounding area.\nMany fear that the accommodation center will have a negative impact on the country. Albania has become a major tourism magnet this year, bringing more than 9 million tourists to its pristine coastline so far.\n\u201cA refugee camp at the port is not compatible with the government\u2019s idea of a European elite tourism,\u201d said Arilda Lleshi, a 27-year-old human rights activist, speaking from Tirana.\nMany people were upset by the fact that \u201csuch an agreement with wide social impact was done without a wide social consultation,\u201d Lleshi said. \u201cIt seems our prime minister continuously takes over to resolve the world\u2019s issues to get some credit internationally, without consulting with people beforehand.\u201d\nThose who will be deported will be sent to Gjader, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the Shengjin port, at a former military airport.\nItaly has committed to pay for the construction of two centers that can hold up to 3,000 migrants at a time.\nAlbania would also provide external security for the two centers, which would be under Italian jurisdiction. While the memorandum offers Albania broad security and financial reassurances, it fails to describe what migration procedures would be followed inside, experts noted.\n\u201cIt was not written by a migration expert,\u2019\u2019 said Hanne Bierens of the Migration Policy Institute Europe. \u201cWe have a lot of questions about how it would work.\u201d\u2019\u2019\nMigrants will be brought to Albania on Italian ships, and Italy agrees to remove any whose applications for international protection have been rejected, under the memorandum.\nHowever, it does not outline how they will be repatriated, which is often a long and difficult process. Nor does it say where migrants will be screened for transfer to Albania, whether at sea or on Italian soil.\nThe head of the port where the migrants will be processed, Sander Marashi, supports the government's agreement, saying that the facility won't be problematic for the port's normal operations.\n\u201cSuch an agreement shows that ... Albanians\u2019 hospitality is not only words but deeds too,\u201d Marashi said.\nBut some Albanians were surprised and not clear about what the agreement meant.\nAlbania has a recent history of welcoming refugees fleeing conflict and poverty, temporarily hosting around 4,000 Afghans in 2020. A small number of Afghans are still in Albania waiting to move to the United States or to other Western countries.\nRama also mentioned how Albanians welcomed ethnic Kosovo Albanians to escape massacres by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 1999. Albania also sheltered Jews and hid them from the Nazis during World War II.\nRequests by The Associated Press to interview government officials at the central and local level about the new deal with Italy were declined.\nThe agreement must be approved in parliament before it takes effect. Albania's political opposition has asked the prime minister to report to parliament before it is voted on. A vote hasn't been scheduled yet.\nRama's governing Socialists have 74 seats in the 140-seat parliament, so in theory, the government shouldn't have any issues in passing it. But the deal has created such consternation among some sectors of the population that passing it could become problematic.\nAlbert Rakipi of the Albanian Institute for International Studies considered the deal as \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201cdeceitful and unsustainable,\u201d and \u201cunreasonable.\u201d\n\u201cNone of the thousands of people risking their lives to reach Europe dream of a future in which they are placed in camps in a small and poor country just outside\" the borders of European Union countries, Rakipi said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Colleen Barry in Milan, Italy, contributed to this report.\nFollow Llazar Semini at https://twitter.com/lsemini\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

It said Micron was not paying its fair share to use the patented inventions.\n\"While we cannot discuss the specifics of pending litigation, I can confirm that YMTC recently filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Micron Technology, Inc for infringement of our company\u2019s patents related to the design, manufacture, and operation of 3D NAND technology,\" YMTC said in a statement to Reuters on Monday. \"We are confident that this matter will be resolved swiftly.\"\nMicron declined to comment on pending litigations.\nMicron makes DRAM chips and NAND flash memory chips and competes with South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as well as Japan's Kioxia, a unit of Toshiba. YMTC is a much smaller rival which was last year barred by the U.S. from buying certain American components.\nThe U.S. in recent years has increased restrictions on exporting chipmaking technology to China on security grounds.\nIn May, China said Micron products failed a network security review and barred purchase of them by operators of key infrastructure.\nMicron was embroiled in a dispute in 2018 involving Chinese state-backed chipmaker Fujian Jinhua which was accused of - and which denied - trade secret theft. Later that year, its main products were subject to a temporary sales ban in China.\nChina was once Micron's biggest market, generating half of its $20 billion revenue in fiscal 2017. That share shrank to 16% in 2022, a year in which it closed DRAM operations in Shanghai.\nMicron has said it remains committed to China.

It\u2019s also spurred major players like Citigroup Inc. to enter massive metal-financing trades: buying metal cheaply and selling it forward for profit.\nTo be sure, the switch to contango is partly driven by higher interest rates, which adds to the cost of borrowing the funds needed to buy and hold metal for longer periods. That pushes those selling futures to demand a higher premium for metal deliverable at a later date.\nIn copper \u2014 which is often bought as a proxy for growth \u2014 the discount for spot metal relative to three-month futures recently touched the lowest since 2009 as a percentage of the price. At a major industry event in Shanghai last week, sentiment for 2024 was mixed, with many market players expecting a growing surplus of refined metal even as output from mines is under pressure.\nStill, the metal has benefited in recent days from expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year, as well as robust demand from China\u2019s renewable industry. Stockpiles in Asia\u2019s largest economy have depleted to critically low levels this year, a sign of local market tightness that could pull copper onshore.\n\u201cContango is usually seen as a negative signal, as it indicates there is ample spot market supply around, and incentivizes putting the commodity into storage,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts including Amy Gower wrote in a note. But for copper \u201csince 2003, a strong contango has not been a negative signal for prices, likely as China has been there to absorb excess material.\u201d\nCopper futures on the LME fell 1.1% to $8,355 a ton by 2:55 p.m. in London. All major metals were lower. Aluminum slid 1.3% and zinc fell 1.9%.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

The order has not been previously reported.\nThe ruling is a setback for Tesla after the company won two product liability trials in California earlier this year over the Autopilot driver assistant system. A Tesla spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.\nThe Florida lawsuit arose out of a 2019 crash north of Miami in which owner Stephen Banner's Model 3 drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler big rig truck that had turned onto the road, shearing off the Tesla's roof and killing Banner. A trial set for October was delayed, and has not been rescheduled.\nBryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor, called the judge's summary of the evidence significant because it suggests \"alarming inconsistencies\" between what Tesla knew internally, and what it was saying in its marketing.\n\"This opinion opens the door for a public trial in which the judge seems inclined to admit a lot of testimony and other evidence that could be pretty awkward for Tesla and its CEO,\" Smith said. \"And now the result of that trial could be a verdict with punitive damages.\"\nThe Florida judge found evidence that Tesla \"engaged in a marketing strategy that painted the products as autonomous\" and that Musk's public statements about the technology \"had a significant effect on the belief about the capabilities of the products.\"\nScott also found that the plaintiff, Banner's wife, should be able to argue to jurors that Tesla's warnings in its manuals and \"clickwrap\" agreement were inadequate.\nThe judge said the accident is \"eerily similar\" to a 2016 fatal crash involving Joshua Brown in which the Autopilot system failed to detect crossing trucks, leading vehicles to go underneath a tractor trailer at high speeds.\n\"It would be reasonable to conclude that the Defendant Tesla through its CEO and engineers was acutely aware of the problem with the 'Autopilot' failing to detect cross traffic,\" the judge wrote.\nBanner's attorney, Lake \"Trey\" Lytal III, said they are \"extremely proud of this result based in the evidence of punitive conduct.\"\nThe judge also cited a 2016 video showing a Tesla vehicle driving without human intervention as a way to market Autopilot. The beginning of the video shows a disclaimer which says the person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. \"The car is driving itself,\" it said.\nThat video shows scenarios \"not dissimilar\" than what Banner encountered, the judge wrote.\n\"Absent from this video is any indication that the video is aspirational or that this technology doesn\u2019t currently exist in the market,\" he wrote.

Since that time, Disney's stock has hit multiyear lows while activist investor Nelson Peltz launched yet another fight against the media giant. This time, he's pushing for multiple board seats.\nOn top of that, the company's parks business is slowing, its linear TV division is declining, and its streaming business is not yet profitable. There have been more misses than hits at the box office as investors question whether or not Disney has lost its magic.\nDisney stock, which closed down about 3% on Tuesday, has risen about 6% since the start of the year \u2014 massively underperforming the S&P's (^GSPC) 18% gain over that same time period.\n\nStill, Iger said there are reasons to be optimistic about its future.\n\"We have real reason at Disney to be optimists, and it starts with the fact that we're Disney,\" he told employees. \"And Disney, as you know, is a brand unto itself, but it's also an umbrella company that houses many assets and many great brands. So, reason to be optimistic number one is that.\u201d\nIger said he will be assessing the longterm potential for all of Disney's assets, with a particular focus on future growth.\n\"As is the case with all of our businesses, which we must do in order to basically serve shareholders, is we look at the future of all of our business with an eye towards are these businesses going to grow?\" he said. \"Will they stay the same or will they possibly decrease in value? And if so, what should we do about it?\"\nEarlier this summer, he had said the company would take an \"expansive\" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling they could potentially be sold.\nBut management seemed to downplay those comments with Dana Walden, head of Disney's entertainment division, telling employees on Tuesday that TV content remains vital to Disney's streaming ambitions.\n\"What we've discovered is that our linear channels are very deeply embedded in our streaming strategy,\u201d Walden said. \u201cThey want to watch live shows, sports, live events \u2014 they want to watch them in time period, and the place you can do that, for the most part is on linear channels \u2026 The notion of a communal event still exists largely on linear.\"\nOverall, Bob Iger said Tuesday this past year has been spent \"fixing a lot of things\" but that the company has \"emerged from a period of a lot of fixing to one of building again.\"\n\"I can tell you building is a lot more fun than fixing,\" he quipped.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\n(Adds analyst view of the impact of rise in Treasury yields in 11th paragraph, adds inflation data and an analyst comment in final paragraphs.)\nBy Ann Saphir\nOct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials will likely leave their policy rate on hold at next week's meeting thanks in large part to a new dynamic unfolding before them: Other forces are finally doing the work for them.\nWhile the benchmark rate they set every six weeks or so has sat unchanged since July - a horizon that now looks to extend to December if not longer - rates on the open market that determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers have kept climbing and now look poised to finally slow what has been a surprisingly strong economy.\nIndeed fresh tidbits on the lending environment are likely to feature prominently in briefing materials ahead of the Federal Reserve's Oct 31-Nov. 1 rate-setting meeting.\nThe Fed's latest survey on banking conditions won't be published until the Monday after next week's meeting, but past practice suggests findings from its October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, or SLOOS, are in policymakers' hands this week.\nThe Fed began its rate-hike campaign against high inflation in March of 2022, taking the policy rate from near zero then to 5.25%-5.50% as of July of this year.\nData published from Fed surveys currently in the public domain shows banks have already tightened standards for all kinds of business and consumer loans, demand for most types of loans has weakened, and growth for all stripes of loans has slowed.\nBusinesses have become particularly uninterested in borrowing, banks reported in the Fed's July senior loan officers opinion survey. Those trends have so far done little to weigh down strong GDP growth and consumer spending that along with large job gains seem to suggest ongoing upward pressure on prices.\n\"We don't have a lot of data to really hang our hat on at this point,\" said BMO's Scott Anderson. But the impact of tighter credit is coming, he said, and \"we're pretty confident we'll see a slowdown.\" Fed policymakers seem to be largely on that same page, with several noting the rise in the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note - up about a full percentage point since the Fed's last rate hike, to 4.85% - will also cool the economy.\nAnalysts differ over how to interpret the recent tightening of financial conditions. Analysts at Deutsche Bank estimate the rise in longer-term yields equates to the impact of three quarter-point Fed rate hikes, giving the Fed less itself to do. Barclay's view, by contrast, is that the tightening is driven by expectations for further Fed action, and actually underscores the need for another rate hike.\nGREATER PESSIMISM\nOverall U.S. commercial bank credit shrank during the third quarter, the first year-over-year decline in more than a decade, weekly Fed data show.\nThe decline was largely driven by a drop in the value of Treasury bonds as yields soared. Mortgage-backed securities held broadly by banks also fell in value, as mortgage rates have risen, most recently to a 23-year high of 7.9%.\nAnd a yearlong decline in loan demand accelerated in the second half of September, according to a twice-quarterly Dallas Fed survey of Texas banking conditions that closely tracks the Fed's national survey.\nBanks have become more pessimistic about future business activity, that survey showed, leading them to forecast even weaker loan demand ahead.\nBanks responding to the Dallas Fed survey reported increased delinquency for all kinds of borrowers, but particularly for consumer loans. That could be a particularly telling turn of events, because other Fed data shows that even as U.S. banks have tightened credit card standards, credit card borrowing did not slow in the second quarter.\nHouseholds have spent down much of the savings they built up during the pandemic, and employment gains don't look sustainable, said Nationwide's Kathy Bostjancic.\nAll that may add to a picture that sets the stage for a weaker fourth quarter, and further slowing next year, more reason for the Fed to keep rates where they are and let tighter credit and financial conditions do their work.\n\"The key question is the degree growth cools in the coming quarters to further relieve inflation pressures in the services sector,\" Bostjancic said.\nA Commerce Department report on Friday showed consumer spending surged in September and inflation by the Fed's preferred gauge rose 3.4%, with underlying inflation pressures easing slightly to 3.7% from August's 3.8%.\n\"The spending, income and inflation largely came in line with our expectations, so we forecast that the Fed is done tightening for this cycle, but with growth remaining resilient and inflation elevated the Fed will be in no hurry to cut rates,\" Bostjancic wrote after the report. \"We look for the Fed to keep rates on hold through mid-year 2024.\"\n(Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Dan Burns and Chizu Nomiyama)",

But enthusiasm among corporate technology buyers for features like the ability to summarize heaps of email into a few bullet points or speedily complete lines of computer code helped the company's revenue rise 13% to $56.5 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. That compares with analysts' consensus estimate of $54.52 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\"The results indicated that artificial intelligence products are stimulating sales and already contributing to top and bottom-line growth,\" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.\nMicrosoft shares were up 3% in after-hours trading.\nIn the reported quarter, revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses its Azure cloud-computing platform where much of the AI work will take place, grew to $24.3 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $23.49 billion, LSEG data showed. Azure revenue rose 29%, higher than a 26.2% growth estimate from market research firm Visible Alpha.\nBrett Iversen, Microsoft's vice president for investor relations, said much of the quarterly sales growth came from customers rekindling their use of Microsoft's cloud in anticipation of using AI services.\n\"What AI is doing ... is opening up either new conversations or extending existing conversations or getting us back in touch with customers that we maybe weren't doing as much with,\" Iversen told Reuters.\nBy comparison, Google-parent Alphabet's cloud division missed estimates for third-quarter revenue on Tuesday as an uncertain economy and high interest rates led its customers to trim their budgets.\n\"While a single quarter doesn\u2019t a major trend make, this quarter\u2019s cloud results from Microsoft and Google suggest that Azure is gaining share against its competition,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. \"It could be that Microsoft\u2019s very strong messaging on their (AI) technology is getting companies to consider them in a more serious way.\"\nMicrosoft said fiscal first-quarter profit was $2.99 per share, above analyst estimates of $2.65 per share, according to LSEG data.\n\"There are some weaker areas; search advertising revenues, for one, is growing slower than most segments,\" said Jeremy Goldman of research firm Insider Intelligence.\nMicrosoft said search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased by 10%. It does not break out the revenue figure for these operations.\nMicrosoft is weaving AI into its own products, such as the $30-a-month \"Copilot\" for its Microsoft 365 service that can summarize a day's worth of emails into a quick update. While the tool is being shown only to a small number of pilot customers until it becomes available next month, it requires businesses to make a number of upgrades to their Microsoft-based systems in order to use Copilot.\nInvestors are also tracking how much Microsoft spends on the massive data centers to power AI software. Microsoft said on Tuesday that fiscal first-quarter capital expenditures were $11.2 billion, up from $10.7 billion in the previous quarter, which itself was the biggest spend since at least fiscal 2016. Microsoft executives say that figure is likely to grow each quarter this fiscal year, putting the company on track to spend more than $44 billion.\nSales of its Windows operating system and other products in the segment grew to $13.7 billion, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of $12.82 billion, according to data from LSEG.\nThe segment containing the LinkedIn social network and its office productivity software grew to $18.6 billion, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of $18.20 billion, according to LSEG data.\nFor its fiscal second quarter, Microsoft forecast an Azure growth rate of 26-27% in constant currency, above analyst estimates of 25.1% according to Visible Alpha.

        "text": "\nBy Valerie Volcovici\nNov 12 (Reuters) - As the world's nations enter another round of talks this week on creating a first-ever treaty to contain plastic pollution, officials are bracing for tough negotiations over whether to limit the amount of plastic being produced or just to focus on the management of waste.\nWorking with a document called a \"zero draft\" that lists possible policies and actions to consider, national delegates to the weeklong meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, will be debating which of those options to include in what eventually would become a legally binding treaty by the end of 2024, officials involved in the negotiations said.\n\"We are at a pivotal moment in this process,\" said David Azoulay, a managing attorney of the Center for International Environmental Law who is an observer to the negotiations.\nThe world is currently producing about 400 million tonnes of plastic waste every year, with less than 10% of it being recycled, according to the UN Environment Programme, choking landfills and despoiling oceans. That produced amount is set to surge in the coming decade, as oil companies, which often also produce plastics, look to new sources of revenue amid the energy transition away from fossil fuels.\nToday, about 98% of single-use plastic - like bottles or packaging -is derived from fossil fuel, according to the U.N. Environment Programme.\nThe European Union and dozens of countries, including Japan, Canada and Kenya have called for -a strong treaty with \"binding provisions\" for reducing the production and use of virgin plastic polymers derived from petrochemicals and for eliminating or restricting problematic plastics, such as PVC and others containing toxic ingredients.\nThat position is opposed by the plastic industry and by oil and petrochemical exporters like Saudi Arabia, who want to see plastic use continue. They argue that the treaty should focus on recycling and reusing plastics, sometimes referred to in the talks as \"circularity\" in the plastics supply.\nIn a submission ahead of this week's negotiations, Saudi Arabia said the root cause of plastic pollution was \"inefficient management of waste.\"\nThe United States, which initially wanted a treaty comprised of national plans to control plastics, has revised its stance in recent months. It now argues that, while the treaty should still be based on national plans, those plans should reflect globally agreed goals to reduce plastic pollution that are \"meaningful and feasible,\" a U.S. State Department spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.\nThe International Council of Chemical Associations wants the treaty to include measures \"that accelerate a circular economy for plastics,\" according to council spokesperson Matthew Kastner.\n\"The plastics agreement should be focused on ending plastic pollution, not plastic production,\" Kastner told Reuters in a statement.\nFor oil, gas and petrochemical producers and exporters, a strong treaty is liability that could curb the sale of fossil fuels, said Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator of the International Pollutants Elimination Network.\nSaudi Arabia and other producers are \"pushing a 'bottom up' approach that makes individual countries responsible for the cleanup, health, and environmental costs of plastics and chemicals while leaving the fossil fuels and plastics industries off the hook,\" Beeler said.\nCountries will also be debating whether the treaty should set transparency standards for chemical use in plastics production.\nBut before they can work on the substantive points, delegates will need to resolve procedural objections that slowed the talks in June when Saudi Arabia said decisions should be adopted by a majority of countries rather than by consensus. A consensus would allow one country to block the treaty's adoption. Most other countries did not support the intervention.\nThe Saudi delegation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nEnvironmental groups said they hoped this week's talks can focus on the treaty's substance, and move beyond the procedural discussions that stall progress.\n\"We need a radical rethink of the global plastics economy and cannot get bogged down by derailing tactics and false solutions,\" said Christina Dixon of the Environmental Investigation Agency.

No cause was given. Munger would have turned 100 on Jan. 1.\n\"Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation,\" Buffett, Berkshire's 93-year-old chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.\nThe death of Munger, a Berkshire vice chairman since 1978, marks an end of an era in corporate America and investing.\nAlongside Buffett, Munger was respected and adored by investors around the world, many of whom flocked to Berkshire's annual shareholder weekends in Omaha, Nebraska, to hear the duo\u2019s folksy wisdom on investing and life.\nThough Munger was not involved in Berkshire's day-to-day operations, his death leaves Buffett without his longtime sounding board.\nInvestors also said that while Berkshire has installed managers it could trust to keep the company going, Munger's loss would be deeply felt, and it prompted an outpouring of sorrow.\n\"It's a shock,\" said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and longtime Berkshire shareholder. \"It will leave a big void for investors who have modeled their thoughts, words and activities around Munger and his insights.\"\nPHILOSOPHICALLY ALIKE\nSince becoming a Berkshire vice chairman, Munger worked closely with Buffett on allocating Berkshire's capital and not mincing words when he thought his business partner was making a mistake.\n\"He was certainly one of the greatest investors, as a team with Buffett,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey. \"I'm sure it is an enormous loss for Buffett personally.\"\nMunger was known for steering Buffett away from purchasing what Buffett called \"cigar butts\" \u2014 mediocre companies that had a puff of smoke left and could be bought for very cheap prices \u2014 and instead favoring quality.\n\"Charlie felt that buying very good businesses at fair prices that could keep compounding and reinvesting cash flow into continued growth was more consistent with how he and Warren were philosophically and liked to invest,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. \"They liked to own businesses forever.\"\nMoney manager Whitney Tilson, who knew Munger personally, said a \"generation of investment managers\" learned some of their craft from Munger and Buffett.\n\"What really glued us to these men was their advice on living a full life by instructing people how to think clearly, to be honest with oneself, to learn from mistakes and to avoid calamities,\" he said.\nTilson said he attended dozens of meetings the men ran and that Munger once quipped to a private audience: \"All I want to know is where I'm going to die so that I never go there.\"\nBERKSHIRE'S FUTURE\nBerkshire is unlikely to replace Munger and has not publicly discussed any need or desire to do so.\nTwo other vice chairmen, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, have day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance businesses, respectively.\nMunger's death comes one week after Buffett donated about $866 million of Berkshire stock to four family charities and issued a rare shareholder letter acknowledging that his own time was finite, in the twilight of his own storied investing career.\nIn last week's letter, Buffett said Berkshire was \"built to last\" and would remain in good hands without him.\nHe has never publicly signaled a desire to step down, including after a prostate cancer diagnosis in 2012.\n\"At 93, I feel good but fully realize I am playing in extra innings,\" Buffett wrote.\nUnder Berkshire's succession plan, which Munger inadvertently mentioned at Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting, Abel would become chief executive once Buffett is no longer in charge.\nBuffett's son Howard would become non-executive chairman, and one or two portfolio managers would take over investments.\nBerkshire's businesses include the BNSF railroad, car insurer Geico, and an array of energy, industrial and retail operations, as well as familiar consumer names such as Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies.\nIt also owns hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks, led by Apple.\nCHANGES WITHOUT CHARLIE\nPerhaps the most noticeable change to the public from Munger's death will be Berkshire's annual weekend, which draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha and is livestreamed worldwide.\nNo longer will Munger be there to share the stage with Buffett and answer dozens of shareholder questions over five hours.\nAbel and Jain, who have answered some of those questions in recent years, may play more of a role.\n\"The annual meeting will never be the same without Charlie's terse, open and honest comments,\" Lountzis said. \"He was so different from Warren, in the sense that Charlie said what he thought and didn't give a damn what anyone else thought.\"\nRusso added: \"Berkshire may be a little less fun without him.\"\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York;

The strikers include licensed vocational nurses, home health aides and ultrasound sonographers, as well as technicians in the radiology, X-ray, surgical, pharmacy and emergency departments.\nOakland, California-based Kaiser has hospitals and clinics that serve nearly 13 million Americans, and union members said understaffing is boosting the hospital system\u2019s profits but hurting patients.\nBoth sides said they prioritized patient health care during their talks.

        "text": "\nBy Jamie McGeever\nNov 30 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\nIf this week has so far been strangely listless for Asian markets, that could be about to change suddenly on Thursday as investors brace for a deluge of top-tier economic data and policy events from across the continent. Among the highlights, South Korea's central bank sets interest rates, China releases its official manufacturing and service sector purchasing managers index reports for November, and India announces its third quarter growth figures.\nThe latest industrial production and retail sales data from both Japan and South Korea are on tap too, all of which could move their respective markets, especially currencies.\nAll else equal, the risks for Asian markets on Thursday may be tilted to the upside, even though stock markets around the world again struggled on Wednesday. That's largely because the ongoing fall in the dollar and U.S. bond yields continues to loosen financial conditions. In theory, this should boost animal spirits and the allure of riskier, higher-yielding assets.\nU.S. financial conditions are the loosest since early September and have eased 100 basis points in a month, according to Goldman Sachs. The bank's global and emerging market indexes ticked up a bit last week, but financial conditions are also looser by around 100 bps from a month ago.\nU.S. rates futures markets are now pricing in more than 100 basis points of rate cuts next year starting in May, and the two-year Treasury yield is its lowest since July - it has slumped nearly 40 basis points this week alone.\nThe dollar on Wednesday hit its lowest since Aug. 10, and most Asian and regional currencies are taking advantage. Two of the best-performers are at the polar opposite ends of the 'carry' spectrum - the New Zealand dollar and Japanese yen. The 'kiwi' dollar got an extra boost on Wednesday following the central bank's 'hawkish hold' - policymakers kept the key cash rate at a relatively high 5.50%, but unexpectedly signaled that it could be raised again if inflation doesn't moderate.\nRemarkably, Japanese interest rates are still negative, but maybe not for much longer. Expectations the Bank of Japan will soon end its negative rate policy has pulled the yen up from the depths, and in the process, eased pressure on the central bank to support the currency via direct FX market intervention. South Korea's central bank is expected to keep its base rate on hold at 3.50% and leave it there until at least the middle of next year. But as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand showed on Wednesday, policymakers retain the ability to surprise.\nIndian GDP growth, meanwhile, is expected to have slowed to a 6.8% annual rate in the July-September period from 7.8%, while Chinese factor activity likely contracted again in November but at a slower pace.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:\n- South Korea interest rate decision\n- China official PMIs (November)\n- India GDP (Q3)\n(By Jamie McGeever Editing by Josie Kao)",

U.S. futures slipped and oil prices edged higher.\nChina reported that its consumer prices fell 0.2% from a year earlier in October while factory-gate prices declined 2.6%, suggesting demand remains slack as the economy struggles to recover from the economic disruptions of the pandemic.\nFalling prices have raised worries that China may fall into a bout of deflation, or chronically lower prices, but some analysts say much of the weakness recently is due to a decline in the cost of pork, a staple item for Chinese.\n\u201cWhat China has right now, is a low rate of underlying inflation, which reflects the fact that domestic demand is fairly weak,\u201d Robert Carnell of ING Economics said in a report. \u201cIf you want to use any term, \u2018disinflation\u2019 would be my preference, but what we are seeing today is mainly the result of a supply excess, rather than a collapse in demand,\u201d he said.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.3% to 17,513.81 and the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher, to 3,054.68.\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.5% to 32,643.60 after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told local reporters he had decided against calling an election before the end of the year.\nSouth Korea's Kospi added 0.5% to 2,432.43, while in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 7,009.60. In Bangkok, the SET lost 1.2%.\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 edged up 0.1%, to 4,382.78. Though the gain was slight, it was enough to extend the index's winning streak to eight days. That ties its longest such winning streak since a nine-day run 19 years ago.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1% to 34,112.27, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1% to 13,650.41.\nEli Lilly rose 3.2% after U.S. regulators said its popular diabetes treatment, Mounjaro, can be sold as a weight-loss drug and tap into a market with massive potential.\nAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were also toward the front of the market, each gaining more than 2% as oil prices continued to drop and ease the pressure on fuel costs.\nWarner Brothers Discovery tumbled 19% after reporting a worse loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also lost more streaming subscribers than forecast.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.49%, down from 4.57% late Tuesday, helping to impart calm across financial markets.\nA swift rise in the 10-year yield beginning in the summer dragged the S&P 500 down by more than 10% from its peak for the year. The 10-year yield briefly topped 5% to reach its highest level since 2007, as it tracked the Federal Reserve\u2019s main interest rate, which is above 5.25% and at its highest level since 2001.\nThe Fed has jacked up rates in hopes of slowing the economy and hurting investment prices enough to put downward pressure on inflation and get it back to its 2% goal.\nLast week, investors took comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell to indicate the central bank\u2019s hikes to interest rates may be done. A recent sharp drop in oil prices has relieved some inflationary pressure, raising the likelihood the Fed might hold rates steady instead of raising them further.\nThe price for a barrel of U.S. crude oil has fallen from above $90 to back to where it was in July, and it dropped another $2.04 to settle at $75.33 on Wednesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell $2.07 to $79.54.\nThe latest Israel-Hamas war has raised concerns about potential disruptions to supplies, causing prices to swing. But now the focus is on faltering demand given slowing growth in many economies, particularly in China.\nEarly Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude added 10 cents to $75.43 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 11 cents to $79.65 per barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar slipped to 150.94 Japanese yen from 150.98 yen.

Falling real wages in July adds to doubts over central bank projections that domestic demand can keep the country on a steady recovery path.\n($1 = 150.5100 yen) (Reporting by Leika Kihara and Yoshifumi Takemoto; Additional reporting by Takaya Yamaguchi; Editing by Kim Coghill and Jacqueline Wong)",

They first met at the G20 summit in Bali a year ago.\nAPEC leaders are due to gather from Nov. 15-17. From Nov. 11 senior finance officials and ministers will meet ahead of the summit, while the annual APEC CEO summit runs from Nov. 14-16.\nWHAT IS APEC?\nAPEC was founded in 1989 as an informal dialogue forum to promote regional economic integration. It initially had 12 members. Now it has expanded to involve more than 100 meetings a year.\nMembership covers 38% of the global population, or nearly 3 billion people, about 62% of GDP, and almost half of global trade.\nAPEC says it operates on the basis of non-binding commitments, open dialogue and equal respect for the views of all participants. Decisions are reached by consensus and commitments undertaken on a voluntary basis.\nAPEC'S MEMBERSHIP\nAPEC's members are: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.\nIt is unique in grouping economies rather than nations, allowing participation of Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, as well as self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as it own. It does not include India, however, the world's most populous country.\nAttempts by India to join APEC have been stymied for decades - first because its economy was not integrated into the global system and then by a membership freeze.\nTaiwan presidents do not attend APEC summits and Morris Chang, founder of semiconductor maker TSMC who went to the Bangkok summit last year, is to represent the island this year too.\nCURRENT CONTROVERSIES\nHong Kong's representation has become controversial. Washington, as host, is in charge of the guest list and in July U.S. congressional aides told Reuters Hong Kong's chief executive, John Lee, would not be invited as he is under U.S. human-rights sanctions.\nThe Hong Kong government said Lee would not attend due to \"scheduling issues\" and Financial Secretary Paul Chan would go to San Francisco instead.\nRussia's participation became divisive after it invaded Ukraine last year and its president, Vladimir Putin, did not attend the 2022 summit in Bangkok. The State Department has said Putin will not be in San Francisco.\nDrafting a final summit declaration will be difficult given divisions over conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nLast year leaders endorsed a text vowing to uphold and strengthen a rules-based multilateral trading system while noting \"most\" of them condemned Russia's war in Ukraine.\nMatt Goodman, a trade expert who was White House coordinator for the 2011 APEC summit, said smaller groups of like-minded states could issue their own statements.\n\"Given the make up of APEC with Russia and China both members, it's more difficult than ever to really come up with some tangible outcomes,\" he said.\nBUZZWORDS\nThe U.S. has chosen the theme \"Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All\" for APEC 2023. It says it aims for an \"interconnected, innovative, and inclusive\" region and \"to advance a free, fair, and open economic policy agenda that benefits U.S. workers, businesses, and families. \"\nAs of 2021, APEC members made up seven of the United States' top 10 overall trading partners.\nGoodman expects the U.S. to emphasize the relative strength of its economy in challenging times - a veiled comparison with difficulties China has faced after years of spectacular growth. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in San Francisco this week ahead of the APEC meetings.\nGoodman said Washington would seek to highlight progress in the 14-nation Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) it created to boost engagement after former President Donald Trump quit a regional trade pact in 2017. However, experts say it has so far failed to convince Asia that IPEF is more than a pale alternative to a fully fledged trade deal.\nFASHION SHOW\nTraditionally APEC leaders wear local costume for a final-day group photo. This started in 1993 when President Bill Clinton prescribed bomber jackets in Seattle.\nPresident Barack Obama, however, broke with tradition in 2011 by not ordering up the Hawaiian shirts that are de rigueur holiday attire on the islands. Whether and how San Francisco rises to the occasion remains to be seen.\n(Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington Additional reporting by Michael Martina in Washington Editing by Michelle Nichols and Matthew Lewis)",

        "text": "\n*\nU.N. accelerates withdrawal from Mali as fighting increases\n*\nKidal base left to rebels as peacekeepers move out\n*\nRestrictions by Mali junta jeopardising U.N. troops and kit\nBy Edward McAllister, David Lewis and Michelle Nichols\nDAKAR, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Before United Nations peacekeepers hurriedly abandoned their base in Kidal in northern Mali on Tuesday, they made a costly call: with insurgents stationed nearby, they destroyed sensitive equipment to avoid it falling into the wrong hands, the U.N. said.\nShortly after the last U.N. convoy rolled out, the ethnic Tuareg rebels announced they had taken over the base. Photos posted on social media on Wednesday appeared to show locals loading trucks with looted goods, including tyres, cables and chairs.\nMali's ruling military junta in June ordered the decade-old UN mission, known as MINUSMA, to leave as its relations soured with former international allies. MINUSMA has accelerated its departure in recent weeks as northern Mali has been engulfed in fighting between the rebels and government forces vying for control over areas it vacates.\nChaos has ensued.\nBloody confrontations have surrounded at least two U.N. bases, and two have also been looted, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the withdrawal. At least a dozen peacekeepers have been injured by explosive devices hit by U.N. convoys heading south, according to U.N. statements.\nThe U.N. has acknowledged difficulties with its departure. MINUSMA said in statements that it has been forced to destroy equipment including vehicles, ammunition and generators that its forces couldn't evacuate after the government imposed restrictions on moving them. Mission spokesperson Fatoumata Sinkoun Kaba told Reuters that millions of dollars of kit has been lost.\nAuthorities have denied approval for air support for convoys travelling over some of the most volatile terrain in West Africa. They ordered a halt to some imports of fuel and spare parts, and in some cases jeopardised the safety of departing peacekeepers, according to the two sources with direct knowledge of the withdrawal.\nMali's government did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\nSecurity analysts have warned that the Malian state could collapse altogether, further destabilising a region where insurgents with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State are gaining ground.\nMINUSMA had originally planned to leave Kidal in mid-November, the sources said. The equipment that was destroyed there and at two other northern bases could have been removed by U.N. trucks earlier, but Mali's junta blocked access, the U.N. said.\nFour aircraft have been grounded for lack of parts, the U.N. told Reuters, without specifying what kind of aircraft.\nDozens of U.N. import requests have gone unanswered, the U.N. Department of Peace Operations and the Department of Operational Support said in an internal letter to the Security Council on Oct. 14, seen by Reuters.\nWith routes to the south under threat from Islamist militants, the mission has explored the possibility of exiting through Algeria to the north or Mauritania to the west, the letter said, both of which were proving \"difficult to operationalise\".\nThe two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak on a sensitive topic, said they believe Mali's junta has sought to delay the retreat to give it time to reach the bases before the U.N. leaves.\nReuters was unable to confirm this but the junta has expressed concern in public pronouncements about the U.N. leaving bases before it arrives, including after the Kidal departure. Last month, it called the acceleration of MINUSMA's withdrawal a \"betrayal\".\n\"NASTY WAR\"\nThe situation marks a bitter end to the U.N.'s mission in Mali, where it deployed after the north was overrun by Islamist militants and Tuareg rebels in a 2012 uprising. MINUSMA initially helped restore some calm, but violence has persisted.\nThousands of civilians have died, and more than 170 peacekeepers have been killed in combat, making MINUSMA the U.N.'s deadliest mission.\nWorsening insecurity prompted military coups in 2020 and 2021. The junta then kicked out French troops who were helping fight the Islamists, teamed up with Russian private military contractor the Wagner Group, and ordered MINUSMA to leave.\nThe mission has until Dec. 31 to pack up. So far, more than 6,000 of nearly 14,000 personnel have left, the U.N. spokeswoman said.\nThe Tuareg rebels signed a 2015 peace agreement brokered by MINUSMA but maintained control of much of the north from Kidal. That accord has fallen apart since the mission began moving out.\nThe first sign of trouble came in early August, when fighting broke out between Mali's army and Tuareg rebels around the U.N.'s camp in Ber in the north. The mission left the camp on Aug. 13, two days early. Its convoy was attacked twice that day, injuring four peacekeepers, it said.\nIn October, gunfire around its base in Tessalit, near the Algerian border, forced peacekeepers to shelter in bunkers, the U.N. said. On Oct. 19, shots hit a MINUSMA plane landing at the airstrip.\nWhen the last troops left Tessalit on Oct. 21, they were denied air support for the nine-day journey across the unpoliced desert.\n\"They are effectively endangering the lives of our troops,\" one of the sources said. As in Kidal, peacekeepers destroyed equipment before leaving that could have been transported in trucks earlier, if the government had allowed.\nAir support was also denied convoys departing Kidal on a 350-kilometre (217-mile) journey south to the city of Gao, the MINUSMA spokesperson said.\nThree security analysts told Reuters that Kidal, a Tuareg stronghold from which rebels have long fought for autonomy of the desert region they call Azawad, was a potential flash point now that the U.N. has left. It is not clear how well positioned the Malian army is to take back the base. It has been trying to reach the city in recent weeks, but progress is slow, the analysts said.\n\"If the base in Kidal falls into the rebels' hands, this will cause an outcry in Bamako,\" said Yvan Guichaoua, senior lecturer at the University of Kent's Brussels School of International Studies. \"A nasty war may eventually erupt.\" (Reporting by Edward McAllister in Dakar, David Lewis in Nairobi and Michelle Nichols in New York.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Beijing earlier this month and met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, as Beijing seeks to boost ties with the Labour party ahead of a general election likely next year.\nWu will be joined by representatives from the Chinese foreign ministry, companies and academic bodies including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Alibaba and Tencent, according to one of the sources, who declined to be identified as the information remained confidential.\nAlibaba, Tencent and Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office did not respond immediately to requests for comment. China's science ministry and foreign ministry, as well as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, did not respond immediately to faxed requests for comment.\nWu was appointed to his role in the science ministry in December 2022. China is restructuring the ministry to channel more resources into achieving scientific breakthroughs, with a goal of moving faster towards self-reliance.\nThe other source said that President Xi Jinping had initially been invited, adding that there had been a big discussion over whether Britain should invite any Chinese officials. \"But eventually the view was taken that to not invite China would be counter-productive,\" the source said. They also declined to be named as the information was confidential.\nLike many countries around the world, China has been caught up in a global craze over generative AI following the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT last year.\nChina now has at least 130 large language models launched by companies including Alibaba and Tencent, accounting for 40% of the global total and just behind the United States' 50% share, according to brokerage CLSA.\n(Reporting by Laurie Chen in Beijing and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; editing by Miral Fahmy)",

The Fed very much wants to keep the door open for additional hikes in December or next year,\" said Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist, F.L Putnam Investment Management in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\nMichael Brown, market analyst at Trader X in London, said \"the 'higher for longer' policy stance remains in place.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 105.05 points, or 0.32%, to 33,157.92; the S&P 500 gained 21.24 points, or 0.51%, to 4,215.04; and the Nasdaq Composite added 95.61 points, or 0.74%, to 12,946.84.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.67% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.57%.

Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.5% to 151.06 yen.\nThe Japanese yen fell sharply on Tuesday, when the Bank of Japan tweaked its bond yield control policy, loosening its grip on long-term rates and pushing the currency to a one-year low against the dollar.\nThat was followed by a fresh and sterner warning from Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Wednesday that authorities stood ready to respond to recent \"one-sided, sharp\" moves in the currency.\nOil prices were last down after the Fed decision.

WHAT IS IT? Semaglutide, developed by Novo Nordisk over decades, is the active ingredient in type 2 diabetes treatments Ozempic and Rybelsus, as well as Wegovy, which is used for weight loss only. Ozempic and Wegovy are delivered by weekly injection; Rybelsus is a pill.\nKnown as a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, it mimics a hormone produced in the gut that helps regulate blood sugar and appetite. Semaglutide in injected form was first approved for use in the U.S. as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in 2017. It was approved there for weight control in 2021. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?\nMore than 650 million people globally were estimated by the World Health Organization to be obese in 2016, and about 480 million have type 2 diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Foundation.\nSupply of semaglutide is not keeping pace with demand.\nNovo, which produces the key ingredients for its treatments at its own factories in Denmark and in the United States, said on Nov. 2 that it expects \"continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications across a number of products and geographies.\"\nOn Nov. 10, the company announced it would spend $6 billion by end-2029 to expand its Kalundborg site in Denmark, mainly to boost output of active pharmaceutical ingredient including semaglutide. This year, it is spending just over $2 billion.\nThe investment will also expand its capacity to fill the pens used to inject the drugs - a process known as fill-finish, it said. It declined to give further details.\nBooming demand for both drugs has propelled Novo Nordisk to its highest-ever profits. In September, it became Europe's most valuable company. WHAT HAVE COUNTRIES DONE?\nBritain in July called for clinicians to only prescribe Ozempic and six other medicines from the GLP-1 class for their licensed uses, not for weight loss.\nBelgium issued a new law on Nov. 14, banning doctors from prescribing Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs for weight loss unless their patient's BMI is 35 or above and they have at least one underlying health condition. People taking part in clinical trials for drugs based on semaglutide may also continue to take it.\nThe curbs will be in force until August 2024, but may end sooner if supplies improve, a spokesperson for the health ministry said.\nGermany is considering banning Ozempic exports, saying the drug is being taken out of the country because it is cheaper there than elsewhere, and demand is driven by use for weight loss.

They also asked if the vehicles collect data on U.S. infrastructure during testing.\nThe letters said in the 12 months ended November 2022 that Chinese AV companies test drove more than 450,000 miles in California.\nIn July, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said his agency had national security concerns about Chinese autonomous vehicle companies in the United States.\n\"Whether we are talking about hardware or software, in the same way there are concerns around telecom or TikTok, there are concerns around transportation technologies,\" Buttigieg told Reuters.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Richard Chang)",

        "text": "\n(Updates prices throughout, adds quote in fifth paragraph)\nBy Rae Wee\nSINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The battered yen was stuck near a three-decade low against the dollar on Tuesday, struggling to find a floor as the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) ultra-easy monetary policy settings remained at odds with the prospect of higher-for-longer rates elsewhere.\nThe Japanese currency slumped to a 15-year low of 162.38 per euro in early Asia trade and slid to a roughly three-month trough of 186.25 per British pound.\nAgainst the dollar, the yen last stood at 151.72, languishing near a one-year low of 151.92 hit on Monday. A break below last year's trough of 151.94 per dollar would mark a fresh 33-year low for the yen.\nThe yen had jumped briefly against the greenback in New York hours on Monday after striking the year-to-date low, which analysts attributed to a flurry of trading in options that come due this week rather than due to any intervention moves from Japanese authorities.\n\"I'm inclined to also think that it wasn't a BOJ intervention... The bout of Japanese yen strength was very brief and reversed very quickly, and if it was a BOJ intervention, I would've expected a more long lasting yen strength,\" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\nDespite the BOJ's carefully orchestrated steps to phase out its controversial yield curve control (YCC) policy and hints of an imminent end to negative interest rates, the piecemeal moves have done little to sustain a rally in the yen, particularly as central banks globally maintain their hawkish rhetoric of higher-for-longer rates.\n\"I think the market has come to the realisation that the Bank of Japan is going to exit its policy but at a very, very, very slow and cautious pace,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (NAB).\n\"A weak yen is probably going to stay here for a little bit longer, and the market has been testing to see what the appetite is, particularly for the (Ministry of Finance) and the BOJ, to allow for weaker levels.\"\nJapanese authorities in September last year intervened in the currency market to boost the yen for the first time since 1998, after a BOJ decision to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy drove the yen as low as 145 per dollar.\nIt intervened again in October 2022 after the yen plunged to a 32-year low of 151.94.\nINFLATION AND THE FED\nOutside of Asia, traders also had their attention on U.S. inflation figures due later on Tuesday, which will provide further clarity on whether the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates even more to tame inflation.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and his chorus of policymakers have in recent days pushed back against market expectations that the U.S. central bank was done with its aggressive rate-hike cycle after it held rates steady at its latest policy meeting.\nThe comments have kept the U.S. dollar bid and against the greenback, the New Zealand dollar fell to an over one-week low of $0.58705.\nSterling eased 0.03% to $1.2274, while the euro gave up 0.02% to trade at $1.06965.\n\"Overall, the market is also kind of worn out by all messages coming from central banks and the higher-for-longer and wait-and-see mode is keeping volatility low,\" said NAB's Catril.\n\"We need to wait for that CPI number tonight, which could be a bit of a shaker. If it's strong, then obviously it brings in the idea that another rate hike from the Fed is there.\"\nDown Under, the Australian dollar dipped 0.1% to $0.6370.\nDomestic data was mixed with Australian business conditions holding firm in October, but consumer confidence sliding in the wake of last week's rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n(Reporting by Rae Wee.

It is due to expire in September 2025, and discussions are currently under way for its possible renewal.\n\"(An extension of) 10 to 20 years is very critical to the investment community. Anything lower than that would generate uncertainty,\" Muchanga told the ministers, who gathered in Johannesburg to form a common position on the future of the programme.\nThe African ministers are due to meet with U.S. officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, on Friday and Saturday.\nU.S. lawmakers and the Biden administration have voiced support for renewing AGOA, which saw over $10 billion worth of African exports enter the United States duty free last year.\nHowever, there is debate in Washington over whether the initiative needs updating.\nConstance Hamilton, the Biden administration's top trade official for Africa, said last week that Congress should consider changes that would \"make the programme more impactful\".\nAfrican governments and some U.S. industry groups warn that attempting to modify AGOA as part of the renewal process could delay its reauthorisation.\n\"If there are any enhancements to be made, those should be done after the extension,\" Muchanga said.\nAGOA's duty free provisions are currently one-sided. U.S. exports to African markets remain subject to national tariffs. Some U.S. lawmakers have in the past suggested the programme should be made more reciprocal.\nAfrica is in the process of setting up a new continent-wide free trade area, known as the AfCFTA, that aims to bring together 1.3 billion people in a $3.4 trillion economic bloc. Once fully implemented it will be the largest free trade area since the establishment of the World Trade Organization.\nMuchanga told the ministers that many of the U.S. officials and lawmakers he had met to discuss AGOA's renewal had assumed U.S. exports would be granted duty free entrance to the AfCFTA.\n\"I've told them very, very frankly that that is not possible,\" he said. \"If they try to export goods from the United States of America into Africa, they are going to meet national tariffs.\"\nThe Biden administration said on Oct. 30 it intended to end the participation of Gabon, Niger, Uganda and the Central African Republic in AGOA over governance and rights failings.\n(Reporting by Joe Bavier, Editing by William Maclean)",

She will take over on Jan. 2, while Wolfe Herd will remain executive chair, Bumble said in a statement.\n\"We view Whitney's departure as a near-to-midterm headwind for business operations and a negative for overall company morale,\" said analysts at Evercore ISI.\nThis is the second big executive departure this year at Bumble following the exit of President Tariq Shaukat, who stepped down after three years in the role.\nWolfe Herd, 33, launched the company in 2014 after an acrimonious departure from Match Group-owned rival app Tinder, which she had co-founded. Bumble's eponymous app stood out in the industry by allowing women to make the first move.\nIn recent years, Bumble, which counts Friends, Badoo, Fruitz (for Gen Z) and Official in its portfolio of dating services, has faced pressure to grow due to unrest in some markets like eastern Europe and competition from larger rival Match.\n\"Bumble has failed to execute on its vision of becoming a broader women's platform for beyond dating use cases like friendship and professional networking.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Some of the largest US companies face billions of dollars in additional interest costs and hits to their profit if they refinance their 2024 maturities at current rates, with a third of them lacking the cash to repay upcoming debt.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nS&P 500 Up 2% as Bets \u2018Fed Is Done\u2019 Sink US Yields: Markets Wrap\nRolex, Patek Prices Hit Fresh Two-Year Lows: Subdial Index\nBiden, Xi to Announce China\u2019s Crackdown on Fentanyl Trade\nThailand Takes $28 Billion Malacca Strait Bypass Plan to US\nTrump Insists on \u2018Disclaimer\u2019 Defense Already Tossed in NY Fraud Trial\nNon-financial companies in the S&P 500 have a combined $107.7 billion in debt coming due next year, with an average interest rate of 2.8%, according to a Calcbench analysis seen first by Bloomberg News. Refinancing at 5.44% \u2013 the rate of the one-year Treasury bill in early November \u2013 would add another $3.09 billion in collective interest expense, the financial research firm said in its analysis. Calcbench focuses on debt disclosures and analysis of financial statements.\nUsing companies\u2019 trailing twelve-month earnings per share ending with the second quarter as a baseline, that higher interest expense would reduce average EPS at 57 businesses with maturing debt in 2024 by $0.11, or 2.92%, Calcbench said. Still, for many of these firms, refinancing or raising money by selling assets is necessary to deal with upcoming debt maturities, especially if they don\u2019t have enough cash.\n\u201cDepending on the nature of the company and the strength of its balance sheet, this is significant,\u201d said Pranav Ghai, the founder and chief executive of Calcbench.\nCompanies are impacted by higher financing costs differently, with about two thirds of businesses holding enough cash to pay down their 2024 debt. The rest \u2014 or 19 companies out of the 57 \u2014 didn\u2019t hold enough cash by the end of the second quarter to extinguish all debt coming due next year, and those numbers have further updated in the most recent quarter.\n\u201cWe found numerous companies where higher interest expense was greater than available cash the companies had on hand, which implies that those companies must refinance or sell off assets to raise more cash,\u201d Ghai said. \u201cThey can\u2019t otherwise pay off the debt.\u201d\nUS firms have been rushing to the market as Treasury rates declined, with highly rated companies raising $1.115 trillion in new debt through Nov. 13, up 1% compared with the prior-year period. Last week alone, investment-grade issuers sold $43 billion in new bonds, with forecasts calling for $100 billion in gross new issuance this month.\nThe cut-off point for Calcbench\u2019s analysis was Nov. 6, with third-quarter results for several dozen S&P 500 companies still outstanding.\nRefinancing Needs\nOne of the companies that holds less cash than its 2024 maturities, according to Calcbench, is pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc. The company has $1.9 billion in debt coming due next year and reported $497 million in cash at the end of the second quarter. Cash holdings declined to $80 million in the third quarter.\nThe company\u2019s 2024 maturities are a small portion of its overall debt, according to its Chief Financial Officer David Michels.\n\u201cWe intentionally spread out our maturity profile in order to minimize annual refinancing impacts,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, at the end of the third quarter, we had over $3.5 billion of short-term liquidity under our credit facilities, which gives us flexibility to remain patient when refinancing our debt.\u201d\nMeanwhile, cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc. is anticipating higher financing costs for next year, said CFO Emmanuel Babeau. While the company wasn\u2019t included in Calcbench\u2019s analysis, it has several maturities in 2024, including $2.65 billion in dollar-denominated debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cWe go through a number of refinancings, some of them next year,\u201d Babeau said.\nUS companies across industries are grappling with whether to refinance their upcoming maturities at the risk of hurting profit or wait until interest rates are lower. The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged in early November, and Wall Street banks are divided on how aggressive they think the US central bank will be in cutting rates next year.\nCostco Wholesale Corp. and biotechnology firm Boston Scientific Corp. are among those that are expected to see a hit to basic EPS if they refinance at current rates, according to Calcbench estimates based on trailing 12-month earnings at the end of the second quarter.\nBoston Scientific \u2014 with $500 million coming due next year and over $1 billion in early 2025 \u2014 will likely see a hit to EPS of 0.83% in 2024, followed by a hefty 4.14% dent to EPS in 2025, Calcbench said. A representative for the Marlborough, Massachusetts-based company said the impact of higher financing costs on its EPS isn\u2019t clear-cut.\n\u201cThere are many approaches we can take when looking at our capital structure,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nCostco is considering repaying a $1 billion bond maturing in 2024 with cash, according to CFO Richard Galanti.

Barkin offered up a litany of ideas for states and localities, including issuing more permits for private single-family homes, reducing unnecessary regulation, and lobbying those who don\u2019t want their towns or communities to change.\nHe also cited some examples of changes in certain parts of the US designed to welcome more housing and boost supply. One government body in Virginia \u2014Wise County \u2014 implemented a tax incentive for renovation, rehabilitation, or replacement of residential and commercial properties.\nIn West Virginia, he said, a newly created Build WV program offers a tax exemption for purchasing construction materials, a 10-year property value tax credit, and the potential for a business and occupation tax exemption.\nBarkin\u2019s comments come as mortgages hover a near multi-decade high of nearly 8%, following an aggressive campaign over the past year and a half to fight inflation by boosting interest rates.\nThese higher rates are contributing to the affordability problem and also indirectly contributing to the supply issue by discouraging homeowners who locked in lower rates from selling.\nThe lack of supply is also rooted in the last housing crisis of 2008, which discouraged builders from taking chances on new development in the debacle's aftermath.\nBarkin said another key question in the quest for more housing supply is what communities are doing to make affordable land more available. Barkin says rezoning is needed to unlock land. He also said states should pitch the conversion of industrial sites into homes for residential home developers.\n\"The key is more supply,\" said Barkin. \"To create that supply, communities need to own the problem, compete for developers, innovate in offering affordable land and lowering costs, and engage with nontraditional partners.\"\nHomeownership \"is becoming increasingly unattainable for too many workers.\"\nClick here for real estate and housing market news, reports, and analysis to inform your investing decisions.",

The conglomerate also reported operating earnings of $10.76 billion, a jump on the prior year, as it benefited from the impact of elevated interest rates on the cash pile and gains at its insurance businesses.\nDespite ramping up Berkshire\u2019s acquisition machine in recent years, the company has still struggled to find many of the big-ticket deals that galvanized Buffett\u2019s renown, leaving him with more cash than he and his investing deputies could quickly deploy. After hanging back during the pandemic, he\u2019s since snapped up shares in Occidental Petroleum Corp. and struck a $11.6 billion deal to buy Alleghany Corp. Buffett has also leaned heavily on share repurchases amid the dearth of appealing alternatives, saying the measures benefit shareholders.\n\u201cCash deployment is definitely slowing,\u201d said Jim Shanahan, an analyst with Edward Jones. \u201cUltimately Berkshire\u2019s going to start feeling some pressure to put cash to work.\u201d\nThe deal drought hasn\u2019t damped investor enthusiasm for the company. Its Class B shares crested a record high in September as investors sought out its diversified range of businesses as a hedge against deteriorating economic conditions. And while the shares pared some of those gains, the stock is still up almost 14% for the full year.\nRead More: Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Rallies to Record High on Earnings Beat\nThe firm also spent $1.1 billion on buybacks in the period, bringing the total for the first nine months of the year to about $7 billion. The conglomerate trimmed its overall equities portfolio in the quarter, making about $5.25 billion on sales net of purchases.\nIncluding investment and derivatives losses, Berkshire posted a loss for the quarter of almost $12.8 billion \u2014 wider than the year prior \u2014 primarily due to losses on its equities portfolio. Berkshire often recommends that investors look past investment gains or losses, which are tied to accounting rules, saying that can be misleading to investors.\nOperating Units\nThe company operates and invests in all corners of the US economy, owning businesses including Geico, BNSF, Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candies, meaning investors view the company as a window into broader economic health.\nStrength in the insurance unit \u2014 plus the inclusion of Pilot Flying J earnings which Berkshire did not include in results last year \u2014 helped drive profitability. Berkshire said its insurance businesses posted a profit of $2.42 billion versus a loss in the prior-year period, when the insurance industry was being pummeled by catastrophes.\nThe company\u2019s Geico unit, which had struggled with unprofitability throughout 2022, also posted a profit compared to the same period a year ago, as it curtailed advertising expenses by 54% year-to-date. The improvement follows efforts by the division to overhaul underwriting after struggling with higher costs for replacing or repairing damaged vehicles. The effort cost it market share \u2014 raising the question if it will seek to reclaim that ground.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\u201cBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s results again demonstrated diversity of earnings power, boding well in uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Operating-company earnings of almost $10 billion were better than our core scenario as a rebound in Insurance, including favorable reserve trends and higher investment income, offset declining railroad earnings and energy litigation costs.\u201d\nMatthew Palazola, BI senior industry analyst, and Eric Bedell, BI associate analyst\nBerkshire posted stronger operating earnings despite Buffett cautioning at its annual meeting in Omaha in May that earnings at the majority of its operating units could fall this year as an \u201cincredible period\u201d for the US economy draws to the end. Still, the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive pace of rate hikes has helped the firm reap greater yield on the cash it stockpiles primarily in short-dated US Treasuries.\nRead More: Warren Buffett Predicts Earnings Decline at Berkshire Units\nAt the same time, those higher rates created headaches for some of Berkshire\u2019s industrial businesses. The conglomerate\u2019s building products businesses saw revenue slip 11% due to the run-up in mortgage rates.\n\u201cThe effects of significant increases in home mortgage interest rates in the US over the past year has slowed demand for our home building businesses and our other building products businesses,\u201d Berkshire said in a report detailing results. \u201cWe continue to anticipate certain of our businesses will experience weakening demand and declines in revenues and earnings into 2024.\u201d\nInflation weighed on other segments of the conglomerate.

By March, it said, the Fed will start to slightly tweak rates lower.\n\"However, as the slowdown in the economy and the extra disinflationary leg begin in earnest, we expect the Fed in the second half of the year to turn to full-on accommodation, with more rate reductions, in line with what it has done historically.\"\nUBS said it expected the Fed to cut rates by 275 basis points, leaving the effective federal funds rate at 2.50%-2.75%. The Fed currently has rates set at 5.25% to 5.50%.\nThat's well ahead of market expectations indicated by data from the CME FedWatch Tool, which expects just 75 basis points of cuts in 2024 that will send the fed funds rate to 4.50%-4.75%.\nDriving UBS's sharp estimate for a reduction in interest rates is their expectation that disinflation will continue throughout 2024, giving the Fed confidence that inflation has been tamed amid slowing economic growth.\nUBS said that it expected the Fed to get serious about cutting interest rates in 2024 and that a lack of fiscal policy support from Washington, DC, would drive the Fed to move forward with the interest-rate cuts.\n\"The historically wide budget deficit, a coming presidential election, and a fractured political landscape to us implies little room for cyclical fiscal support,\" UBS explained.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

        "text": "\nPUEBLO, Colo. (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden used a backdrop of the world's largest facility for wind tower manufacturing to sharpen his criticism of Republicans Wednesday, saying the company's expansion validates an environmental agenda his political opponents want to undo.\nThe company that Biden visited, CS Wind, is on the home turf of Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who has described the president's climate policies as \u201ca massive failure.\u201d\n\"Did you all know that you\u2019re part of a massive failure?\u201d Biden said to the workers and local officials gathered for his speech as he touted hundreds of new jobs fueled by tax incentives for clean energy initiatives. \u201cNone of that sounds like a massive failure to me. How about you?\u201d\nBiden\u2019s rebuttal to Boebert was fresh evidence of the Democratic president's intention to more aggressively push back against what he calls \u201cMAGA Republicans.\" He has been struggling with low approval ratings, and Democrats are anxious for him to gain ground politically ahead of a likely rematch against Donald Trump next year.\nBoebert, who has cultivated a national reputation as a right-flank insurgent, taunted Biden from Washington, where she said, \u201cI hope there\u2019s not a silver alert that goes out for him\u201d during his trip. The alerts can be sent for missing elderly people with dementia.\nPueblo, a city of about 110,000 south of Denver, is one of the anchors of Colorado\u2019s sprawling 3rd Congressional District, which covers more ground than Pennsylvania. Boebert won her seat in 2020 and barely held on to it during the 2022 midterms.\nDemocrats are eyeing it as one of their top pickup opportunities as they aim to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives, which is narrowly controlled by Republicans. Boebert suggested, \u201cJoe Biden coming to my district probably helps me win reelection.\u201d\nShe recently suffered an embarrassing episode when she was kicked out of a musical production of \u201cBeetlejuice,\u201d where she was spotted vaping. She faces a likely rematch against Democratic candidate Adam Frisch.\nDuring his speech in Pueblo, Biden rejected criticisms that his policies are a form of socialism.\n\u201cMy plan is rooted in what has always worked best for this country: Investing in America. Investing in Americans,\u201d Biden said, putting his hand on the shoulder of a worker wearing a bright yellow safety vest.\nBiden was originally scheduled to visit Pueblo on Oct. 16, but the trip was postponed so he could remain in Washington to focus on the conflict in the Middle East. Two days later he went on a last-minute trip to Israel to show support for the country after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.\nCS Wind is undergoing a $200 million expansion that is expected to create 850 jobs by 2026 with help from the tax benefits in Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which included hundreds of billions of dollars of financial incentives.\nIn addition, a new analysis from the Treasury Department said clean energy investments have mostly flowed to communities with below-average wages and above-average child poverty. The White House said the data indicated that Biden's policies are expanding economic opportunity.\nBiden arrived in Colorado on Tuesday after attending a memorial service in Atlanta for Rosalynn Carter, the former first lady and wife of former President Jimmy Carter. He spoke at a Tuesday night fundraiser in Denver, where he said Trump and Republicans want to abandon his administration's efforts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now investing in America,\u201d he said.\nBiden in recent weeks has been taking an increasingly confrontational stance toward Republicans. For example, during a White House event focused on supply chains on Monday, he unleashed a broad critique.\n\u201cThey want to go back to the bad old days, when corporations looked around the world to find the cheapest labor they could find, to send the jobs overseas, and then import the products back to the United States,\u201d he said.\nBiden also said Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare, benefits that are crucial for many elderly Americans.\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t give up,\" he said. \"But guess what: We won\u2019t let these things happen.\u201d\n___\nMegerian reported from Washington.

The Asian nation imposed anti-dumping tariffs of up to 218% on wine in March 2021, decimating what had been one of Australia\u2019s major overseas markets.\nAustralia suspended its World Trade Organization case against the wine tariffs in October after reaching an agreement to \u201cmove forward to resolve this dispute.\u201d As part of that agreement, Beijing was to review the tariffs, a process expected to take five months, the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement at the time, adding that it was \u201cconfident of a successful outcome.\u201d\nChina imposed tariffs on wine and barley in an apparent attempt to punish Australia after then Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in 2020 called for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, angering Beijing.

Hon Hai, the listed arm of Foxconn Technology Group, and fellow iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp. fell in Taipei on Friday.\nStill, Cook said the iPhone continues to make inroads in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market. Various models accounted for the four top-selling phones in urban China, he said.\n\u201cChina is an incredibly important market,\u201d the CEO said during a post-earnings conference call with analysts. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very optimistic about it.\u201d He didn\u2019t face any direct questions about the situation.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nApple\u2019s conference call did little to ease fears about a potential slowdown of product sales in China, which were notably below consensus at $15 billion, down 2.5% vs. last year, compared with expectations of a 10% increase. Services growth of 16% was the biggest positive surprise, helping to counter weak sales in China, and could be in double digits again in fiscal 1Q. Overall, these results and the 1Q outlook lead us to believe that fiscal 2024 sales growth will likely be about 2% lower than consensus of 5.6%.\n- Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard, BI analysts\nClick here for the full research\nThe iPhone 15 went on sale on Sept. 22 \u2014 only about a week before the quarter ended \u2014 so the latest results only provide an early sense of how the device is doing. Investors will get a clearer picture when Apple reports its holiday results early next year.\nIf the overall China smartphone market is contracting \u2014 as analysts have said \u2014 Apple\u2019s results suggest that it\u2019s winning market share, Cook said. He also touted that the company is opening a new store in the country this week. It\u2019s coming to Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province and will be the company\u2019s 46th in the region.\nCook was in China last month and said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more excited\u201d about the interactions he had with customers and employees, reiterating Apple\u2019s commitment to manufacturing in the country. Beijing announced its investigation into Foxconn about a week after.\n(Updates with shares in second paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nShipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\nFoxconn Makes Your iPhone.

It did not disclose terms, but people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that Silver Point provided $500 million of financing.\nThe suitor that made the most progress in the sale process for GOJO was Georgia-Pacific, a company owned by Koch Industries, the sources said. The terms of Georgia-Pacific's unsuccessful offer could not be learned.\nA GOJO spokesperson said that the company explored a range of options, but declined to outline them.\n\u201dWe have selected and are pleased with our path moving forward,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nSilver Point, Georgia-Pacific and Koch Industries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nGOJO was founded in 1946, when rubber factory worker Goldie Lippman and her husband, Jerry, partnered with chemistry professor Clarence Cook to invent what became the world's first one-step, rinse-off hand cleaner. The company expanded into skincare and invented Purell, an alcohol-based hand cleaner which dries on its own, in 1988. The company launched Purell in the consumer market in 1997.\nGlobal revenue in the hand sanitizing industry skyrocketed from about $1 billion in 2019 to $6.3 billion in 2020, according to Statista Market Insights, as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand. But sales dropped to $2.95 billion in 2022 as the pandemic subsided. Statista forecasts the market to grow by 3.96% on a compounded annual basis over the next four years.

That has opened more market opportunities such that across Nigeria, for instance, young people on social media are steadily opening fashion brands.\n\u201cAfricans want to wear Africa. It\u2019s really beautiful to see because it hasn\u2019t always been like this,\u201d said Omoyemi Akerele, who founded the Lagos Fashion Week in 2011 to encourage the patronage of Nigerian and African fashion. \u201cBut fast forward, a decade after, that\u2019s all people want to wear.\"\nFeaturing a mix of designers from across the continent, the annual fashion show celebrates \u2014 and provides a market for \u2014 local brands mostly highlighting African culture and crafts in various colours and styles.\nIn Nigeria and other parts of Africa, young fashion designers are hungry for success and are taking over the global scene, said the UNESCO director-general.\n\u201cA new breed of young designers is causing a stir in the international scene, reinventing the code of luxury while at the same time reconciling them with the demands of sustainable, local fashion and heritage,\" she said.\nOne such designer at the Lagos Fashion Week, Ejiro Amos-Tafiri, said she uses her brand to tell African stories while celebrating \u201cthe sophistication, class and uniqueness of every woman.\u201d\n\u201cWith more exposure, people are coming to realize that there is a lot of culture in the Nigerian culture, particularly in the fashion industry,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Africa is really the next frontier (for the fashion industry).\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press journalist Dan Ikpoyi in Lagos, Nigeria contributed.",

Payments that did not go through late last week had to be resent, a process that can take time.\nIt\u2019s not clear how widespread the impact continues to be or how long it will take for all customers to receive their deposits.\nThe Clearing House, the private operator of ACH, told CNN on Monday it is working with banks and the Federal Reserve to \u201cresolve this issue as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\u201cMany of the delayed payments have already posted, and we will continue working with financial institutions to ensure the remaining transactions are processed,\u201d The Clearing House spokesperson Greg MacSweeney said in an email.\nAn industry source confirmed to CNN on Monday that it\u2019s likely some customers haven\u2019t received their deposits yet. The source stressed that banks are at the mercy of the originating bank to resend payment files.\nFederal regulators are watching closely.\nIn a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the agency is \u201caware of the issue and monitoring how institutions are responding.\u201d\n\u201cThis brief disruption underscores the importance of the nation\u2019s payments infrastructure,\u201d the CFPB spokesperson said.\nAs of Monday afternoon, Bank of America and Chase are among the companies where users are reporting problems on Downdetector.\nWells Fargo, US Bank, Truist and other banks where users reported problems on Friday ranked lower on Downdetector.\nSome customers are complaining they still haven\u2019t been paid, while others say they have received their direct deposits.\n\u201cBruh, what\u2019s wrong with @BankofAmerica I can\u2019t even pay my bills,\u201d said one user on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nAnother user on Downdetector wrote to Wells Fargo complaining that payday was Friday and on Monday nothing had been updated.\n\u201cWells Fargo can y\u2019all speed it up? Some of us do have bills to pay!\u201d the user said.\nWells Fargo told CNN the bank will update account balances as originating financial institutions reissue deposits. \u201cWe continue to work directly with our customers,\u201d Wells Fargo spokesman Jim Seitz said.\nBank of America continues to display an alert to online customers warning them that \u201csome deposits may be temporarily delayed\u201d because of an \u201cissue impacting multiple financial institutions.\u201d\n\u201cYour accounts remain secure, and your balance will be updated as soon as the deposit is received,\u201d Bank of America said in the alert. \u201cYou do not need to take any action.\u201d\nChase explained to customers in a message posted on Downdetector that a \u201csystem issue\u201d impacted ACH debits and credits sent to it and other banks.\n\u201cThe originators of these deposits are working to resend the payment files and we will post them as soon as we can,\u201d Chase said in the message.\nAsked for comment, multiple banks referred inquiries to The Clearing House, which is owned by the largest commercial banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, CitiBank and Wells Fargo.\nMacSweeney, The Clearing House spokesperson, told CNN on Monday that the problem started as a \u201cprocessing error\u201d on Thursday where some ACH payment instructions were sent to financial institutions with account numbers and customers \u201cmasked.\u201d That missing data meant that some ACH payments were delayed.\n\u201cThe November 2nd error was an unfortunate and isolated issue, and immediate steps have been taken to prevent a reoccurrence,\u201d The Clearing House spokesperson said. \u201cThe ACH network continues to operate normally, processing tens of millions of electronic payments each day.\u201d\nThe Federal Reserve alerted banks Friday afternoon there was a \u201cprocessing issue\u201d at ACH, the system that allows banks to send electronic payments to each other. Banks use that system to send everything from direct deposit paychecks and Social Security checks to customer bill payments for mortgages and utilities.\nThe Fed noted that the problem originated in the private-sector operator The Clearing House.\nThe Clearing House previously said the problem was caused by a \u201cmanual error\u201d and was not linked to a cybersecurity issue.\nMacSweeney said the problem impacted less than 1% of the daily ACH volume in the United States.\nOf course, 1% of a massive system is still a large amount. The ACH Network processed an average of $330 billion per day in September, according to Nacha, a nonprofit that governs the network.\nMultiple customers complained online over the weekend and on Monday about a lack of communication from their bank about the delayed deposits.\nDennis Kelleher, CEO of financial reform advocacy firm Better Markets, was not surprised.\n\u201cThere always seems to be a conspiracy of silence in the industry when things go wrong\u2026 There should be full transparency so that the public is informed and that there is a basis for confidence that the problems have actually been fixed,\u201d Kelleher told CNN. \u201cWithout transparency you can\u2019t have oversight or accountability, which erodes trust and confidence.\u201d\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

Vietnam-born Duong, who came to Australia in 1980 as a refugee, faces a potential 10-year prison sentence if convicted in the landmark case.\nHe is the first person to be charged under federal laws created in 2018 that ban covert foreign interference in domestic politics and make industrial espionage for a foreign power a crime. The laws offended Australia\u2019s most important trading partner, China, and accelerated a deterioration in bilateral relations.\nThe allegation centers on a novelty check that Duong handed then-Cabinet minister Alan Tudge at a media event in June 2020 as a donation toward the Royal Melbourne Hospital\u2019s pandemic response.\nThe 37,450 Australian dollar (then equivalent to $25,800, now $24,200) donation had been raised from Melbourne\u2019s local Chinese diaspora.\nDefense lawyer Peter Chadwick told the jury Duong denied \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d prosecutors\u2019 allegations that he had attempted to influence Tudge with the check. Duong was the local president of the community group Oceania Federation of Chinese Organizations, a global group for people of Chinese heritage from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.\nChadwick also denied that Duong, who is widely known as Sunny, had been recruited by or collaborated with anyone associated with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\u201cThe fear of COVID hung like a dark cloud over the Chinese community in Melbourne,\u201d Chadwick told the court.\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that Mr. Duong and other ethnic Chinese members of our community decided that they wanted to do something to change these unfair perceptions,\u201d Chadwick added.\nProsecutors allege Duong told colleagues he expected Tudge would become Australia\u2019s next conservative prime minister. But Tudge quit Parliament this year, several months after the center-left Labor Party won elections.\nDuong stood as a candidate for the conservative Liberal Party in Victoria elections in 1996 and had remained active in party politics.\nParty official Robert Clark testified on Friday that he dismissed as \u201cvery superficial and na\u00efve\u201d several of Duong\u2019s policy suggestions.\nThe suggestions included China building Australia\u2019s first high-speed train line between Melbourne and Brisbane.\nProsecutors opened their case on Thursday with allegations that Duong had secret links to global efforts to advance the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\u201cBefore you start thinking of spy novels and James Bond films, this is not really a case about espionage,\u201d prosecutor Patrick Doyle told the jury.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a case about spies as such. It\u2019s a case about a much more subtle form of interference. It\u2019s about influence,\u201d Doyle added.\nThe trial continues next week.",

He also wrote the annual list, a monthly strategy essay, and worked with colleagues on putting together a model portfolio of stocks.\nHe moved from the investment bank to hedge fund Pequot Capital Management where he worked until it went out of business in 2009. Soon after, at age 76, when most people were enjoying retirement, Wien joined private equity firm Blackstone to offer direction and guidance. He was vice chairman of Blackstone's Private Wealth Solutions group.\n\"Byron's life was remarkable in so many ways,\" Blackstone Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray said in a statement to Blackstone employees. \"He was always building new relationships and pushed everyone around him to think about the risks and opportunities that lay ahead.\"\nHis annual list, which he published for 38 consecutive years, focused on a range of topics from who might win U.S. presidential elections, to the role China would play in markets, to where the stock index would move next.\nHe called the list a \"defining product\" adding people all over the world identified him with it. \"I put myself at risk by going on record with these events, which I believe are probable and hold myself accountable at year-end,\" he said earlier this year.\nWhile the list was closely watched, it also drew some scorn.\n\"My wife hopes I give this up as soon as possible,\" Wien told the New York Times about writing it. \"While people are enjoying the holidays, between Thanksgiving and Christmas I am in a total panic, working quite hard on developing these,\" he told the newspaper in 2001.\nIn addition to calling how markets might move, he offered life advice and encouraged people to \"read all the time,\" to \"get enough sleep\" and \"travel extensively.\"\nWien was orphaned as a young man but was sent by a guidance counselor at school to apply to Harvard where he ended up earning his undergraduate and graduate business degrees.\nHe found his way to Wall Street after stints in advertising and consulting.\nHe told the New York Times in 1985 \"I'm not sure I can do this job,\" about the strategist role at Morgan Stanley. \"But if I can do it, I will derive more satisfaction from this job than from going somewhere else and being a portfolio manager.\"\nOne of his life lessons, published in February, was \"never retire.\"\n\"If you work forever, you can live forever. I know there is an abundance of biological evidence against this theory, but I\u2019m going with it anyway,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Chris Reese)",

Stock was last up 4.2% in aftermarket trading.\n\"We have opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth while reducing our expenses, helping further drive operating leverage,\" Chriss said on a call with analysts, adding the company is working on a comprehensive plan for 2024.\nSeparately, it also named Jamie Miller as chief financial officer effective Nov. 6, replacing acting finance chief Gabrielle Rabinovitch.\nMeanwhile, consumer spending has also held up remarkably well this year, keeping the outlook for PayPal bright going into the holidays, as retailers dangle steep discounts on everything from electronics to clothing to entice inflation-weary shoppers.\nPayPal said it expects adjusted profit for the full year to be about $4.98 per share from $4.95 earlier. Analysts on average had expected $4.92, according to LSEG data.\nAnalysts, however, remain focused on PayPal's margins that have underwhelmed investors in recent quarters.

Both are defending against the regulator's claims.\nThe SEC said Payward Inc and Payward Ventures Inc, which operate as Kraken, have since 2018 made hundreds of millions of dollars arranging crypto purchases and sales while turning a \"blind eye\" to securities laws designed to protect investors.\nKraken was also accused of having deficient internal controls and inadequate record keeping, reflected in part in its commingling customer money with its own and paying operating costs directly from customer accounts.\nFailing to register has \"resulted in a business model rife with conflicts of interest that placed investors' funds at risk,\" SEC enforcement chief Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. \"Kraken's choice of unlawful profits over investor protection is one we see far too often in this space.\"\nIn its statement, Kraken said the SEC complaint conceded that any alleged \"commingling\" amounted to \"no more than Kraken spending fees it has already earned.\"\nThe SEC also accused Binance of commingling customer funds, following a Reuters report describing such conduct. Binance has denied the commingling accusation.\nMonday's lawsuit seeks a civil fine, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and a halt to acting as an exchange without registering.\nKraken was founded in 2011. It is backed by investors including Blockchain Capital, Digital Currency Group, Hummingbird Ventures, SkyBridge and Tribe Capital.\nThe case is SEC v Payward Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 23-06003.

        "text": "\nBy David Gaffen and Manas Mishra\n(Reuters) - Healthcare companies who profit from treating obese and overweight patients are trying to convince investors that powerful new weight-loss drugs won't shrink their businesses.\nThe global market for obesity drugs could reach as much as $100 billion within a decade due to the effectiveness of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and similar medicines.\nSuch forecasts have prompted a sell-off in a wide range of companies from makers of bariatric surgery devices to companies whose products address the health issues created by excess weight, from diabetes to sleep apnea.\nHowever, those companies and analysts point to the high prices of the weight-loss drugs, uncertainty over long-term usage and the potential lack of insurance coverage for the costs as potentially limiting the market for them in the long run.\n\"The market is in a shoot-first, ask-questions-later mood when it comes to weight-loss drugs,\" said Nicholas Anderson, manager of the Thornburg International Growth Fund, which holds shares of Novo Nordisk. \"What's less clear on the losers side is who will actually be affected and how long will it take to show up in numbers.\"\nShares of Danish drug company Novo Nordisk are up 28% in the last three months. Eli Lilly, which is expected to soon introduce its own weight-loss drug Mounjaro, is up 25%, ballooning its market value to more than $550 billion, making it the world's most valuable health care company.\nBy contrast, the iShares U.S. Medical Devices exchange-traded fund has lost more than 22% in the last three months.\nInjectable weight-loss drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, are considered highly effective but are also expensive, costing more than $1,300 per month. Some competitors have questioned the potential reach of the GLP-1 market.\n\"We expect it will take at least a decade to reach peak penetration of these products in the indicated population,\" Kenneth Stein, Boston Scientific's global chief medical officer, told investors on Thursday, adding that only a minority of obese American patients will use the drugs. Boston Scientific said the effect on the company's heart devices would be \"very limited.\"\nMargaret Kaczor Andrew, a William Blair analyst covering medical technology companies, says she does not expect a meaningful effect on technologies like glucose monitors, which help manage diabetes. She pointed to the emergence of other drug classes like statins that had reduced cardiovascular disease but not decreased the need for heart devices.\n\"Ultimately, it does not impact device utilization,\" she said.\nMichael Farrell, CEO of Resmed, which makes devices to treat sleep apnea, said on an investor call Thursday that the company is \"tracking many thousands of patients on GLP-1 and we're seeing maintenance of adherence. We're seeing maintenance of resupply programs and really no change.\"\nWAIT AND SEE\nSome investors said the drugs could reduce the need for invasive weight-loss procedures like bariatric surgery.\n\"It seems very natural for people to try the drugs, see about the weight loss they get, and how long-lasting it is and then delay bariatric surgery or avoid it all together,\" said Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\nJohnson & Johnson said third-quarter medical device sales fell short of analyst estimates due to a slowdown in devices used in bariatric surgeries.\nYet only about one-third of patients prescribed a weight-loss drug like Wegovy were still taking it a year later, Reuters reported in July, citing an analysis of pharmacy claims data.\n\"We expect that many of them will not stay on the drug for longer than a year or two, and at that time, will consider bariatric surgery,\" Myriam Curet, chief medical officer at Intuitive Surgical, said on the company's Oct. 19 earnings call. \"Overall, we'll see an increased interest in bariatric surgery, but that will get delayed in the short term.\"\nThe weight-loss drugs' cost and uncertainty about whether their use will improve the long-term health of patients and reduce healthcare spending will limit near-term expansion of insurance coverage, said Ann Hynes, a healthcare services analyst at Mizuho Securities.\nShe recently held a call for investors with two health insurers with insight on corporate health plans.\n\"Nothing is going to change in '24. If anything, I think (insurance) access is going to get stricter. It could evolve in 2025, 2026,\" Hynes said.\n(Reporting by David Gaffen in New York and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Michael Erman and Caroline Humer in New York; Editing by Sonali Paul)",

He was 68.\nAt Li's funeral at a Beijing cemetery where high-ranking officials and national heroes are laid to rest, President Xi Jinping and his wife, with the six other members of the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee, the highest rung of political power in China, as well as Vice President Han Zheng paid their final respects.\nThe group stood in silence and took three bows, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nFormer President Hu Jintao sent a wreath to express his condolences over Li's passing, according to Xinhua.\nMessages for the late premier flooded social media platforms as Chinese citizens mourned his death.\nOn popular social media platform Weibo, which replaced its 'like' button with a chrysanthemum flower symbolising mourning on related posts, tens of thousands of people left comments bidding Li farewell on a Thursday post by China's national broadcaster.\nLi was the top trending topic on Weibo.

        "text": "\nWhen the dreaded cold months of winter arrive, it means many homeowners are put in a difficult conundrum to keep their homes warm without breaking the bank.\nAnd staying warm is becoming increasingly expensive.\nThe average cost of home heating is projected to remain at near record levels this winter after increases of an estimated 17.2% last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. The organization released a report in September finding that the average American household is expected to pay anywhere from $787 to $2,094 in heating costs between October and March.\nBut resourceful homeowners can find plenty of ways to cut down on costs.\nHere are some tips from experts on how to stay warm this winter while still reducing your heating bills:\nWhat is solar winter? What to know about the darkest time of year\nA heating system that's running efficiently saves money.\nThat means the pricey cost of paying for a professional to come to your home and inspect your unit (anywhere from $150 to $500, Consumer Reports estimates) can pay off in the long run.\nClimate-friendly heat pumps, for instance, can use up to 25% less fuel when they're well-maintained, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\nInspections include replacing dirty filters and checking for safety issues like carbon monoxide leaks.\nUnless you live alone, you've probably engaged in thermostat wars with a loved one or roommate who simply prefers to keep your residence at a different temperature. However, experts have helpful recommendations for the proper home temperature in the winter.\nThat magic number? 68 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Department of Energy.\nBut if that's too specific, anywhere around 70 degrees is a good target when it gets cold, Ram Narayanamurthy, deputy director of the U.S. Department of Energy's Building Technologies Office, told USA TODAY.\n\u201cA home that\u2019s at 70 degrees is quite comfortable,\u201d Narayanamurthy said.\nWhile 70 degrees is the ideal number, it's unwise to set your thermostat to one temperature and never change it. Lower temperatures may be ideal when sleeping at night or when you're away from your home, Narayanamurthy cautioned.\nNarayanamurthy said he usually sets his at 64 degrees if he leaves his home for an extended period of time, though everyone's comfort levels may be different.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want your heater turning on all the time when no one\u2019s at home,\u201d he said.\nPenny-pinchers may be tempted to set their thermostat at bracing levels and survive the winter by bundling up in layers or piling on blankets.\nWhile you'd have to set your home at a pretty low temperature for it to become a health risk, Narayanamurthy warns against going below 60 degrees.\n\u201cYou have to keep it really low to really get into a health concern,\" he said. \"What you want to do is keep it at a reasonable temperature that\u2019s not chilly.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization recommends keeping indoor temperatures between 64 and 75 degrees for healthy people. But for those who are very young, elderly, or who have health problems, the minimum temperature shouldn't dip below 68 degrees, the organization says.\nIs Toys R Us back? Toys R Us comeback continues with store opening inside Mall of America\nSmart thermostats enabled with Wi-Fi are becoming increasingly popular among many Americans, especially those who have replaced their furnace in recent years, Narayanamurthy said.\nIn fact, he estimated that up to 33% of households now have them.\nBecause many can connect to smartphones via mobile apps, smart thermostats provide the option for homeowners to program their thermostats while they're away from home or even set a schedule.\nSome advanced options are capable of recognizing a homeowner's pattern and adjusting the temperatures at certain times or even in certain rooms of the house.\nThe average Energy Star-certified smart thermostat can save about 8% of a homeowner's annual heating and cooling bills, according to Consumer Reports.\n\"There\u2019s a proven energy savings from a smart thermostat,\u201d Narayanamurthy said. \u201cThe aim is to make it more seamless to make your home more comfortable.\u201d\nMany homeowners may be tempted to rely on fireplaces, space heaters, electric blankets and wood-burning stoves to keep warm in the winter.\nAccording to Direct Energy, these types of secondary heating sources can help to slash costs since they offer heating to a more targeted area of your home at a fraction of the cost of cranking up the thermostat.\nBut many of these options come with their own safety risks and similarly require routine maintenance, care and even replacement.\nOnce a fire hazard, modern electric space heaters are much safer than they used to be with built-in safety features that turn the heaters off if they tip over, overheat, or have been left turned on for too long.\nAn energy-efficient audit could be a great way for homeowners to find where their heating and cooling efficiency is lacking, Narayanamurthy said.\nTrained energy assessors can evaluate homes for issues like insufficient insulation or a heating system that might warrant replacement and then develop a plan for homeowners to address issues and lower energy bills.\nThe Home Performance with Energy Star program, a collaboration between the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, matches consumers in 20 states with reputable home performance contractors for assessments.\nIf this all still sounds expensive, Narayanamurthy recommends you consider taking advantage of available rebates and tax credits through the Department of Energy.\nDue to the recently approved Inflation Reduction Act, now may be a great time to install energy-efficient products and replace heating systems that are 15 years old or older. Funding is available for all kinds of other upgrades as well, from doors to windows, and to insulation. More information is available at energysaver.gov.\nExperts offer a variety of other tips that, altogether, could cut down on cold air coming into your home and reduce the workload on your heating unit.\n\u25fe Weather-stripping doors and improving insulation help to keep warm are in and cold air out.\n\u25fe Draft air coming in through windows may mean they're in need of maintenance \u2013 or replacement altogether. But before getting new windows, homeowners can try to caulk them to prevent air leaks. If replacements are needed, Consumer Reporters recommends considering low-emissivity (low-e) storm windows, which are coated to help keep the warmth inside.\n\u25fe Cold air creeping in at the bottom of doors? A lengthy draft stopper (or even a rolled-up towel) is an inexpensive way to seal it off.\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The market is still not sure on U.S. growth.\"\nU.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in October, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said, while producer prices posted the biggest decline in three-and-a-half years last month, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nMore than 80% of the decline last month in the Producer Price Index for final demand goods was attributed to a 15.3% drop in gasoline prices, BLS said.\n\"The markets are anticipating rate cuts coming in the first couple of quarters next year,\" said Roosevelt Bowman, senior investment strategist at Bernstein Private Wealth Management in New York.\n\"But in our view, we just don't think that downward momentum in inflation is going to be nearly as fast as what the market is estimating,\" he said.\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency versus six others, rose 0.30%, off its two-month low of 103.98 on Tuesday. The euro was down 0.32% at $1.0844, after touching its highest since August the day before.\nInvestors have all but eliminated the likelihood of another rate hike when Fed policymakers meet in December, while bets of a rate cut in May 2024 increased to more than 65%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\nThe fourth quarter in the past two years has not been good for the dollar, which peaked in the third quarter of both 2021 and 2022 and sold off through to January each year, said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies in New York.\n\"I'm not necessarily saying that history is going exactly to repeat itself, but I don't necessarily want to be buying or getting long the dollar just yet,\" he said. \"We need to see more of this play out.\"\nEarlier in Britain, data showed inflation last month eased to 4.6%, its slowest pace in two years.

If we don't then we're probably in the context of a new early stage bull market here,\" he said.\n\"That's the question that investors are going to be asking themselves while watching yields - the information we get between now and the end of the year on yields and economic data as it relates to recession is going to drive the tape.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.33 points, or 0.12%, to 34,112.27; the S&P 500 gained 4.40 points, or 0.10 %, at 4,382.78; and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.56 points, or 0.08 %, at 13,650.41.\nThe Dow's decline snapped a seven-session winning streak.\nMeanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did not comment on monetary policy in opening remarks at the U.S central bank statistics conference on Wednesday. He is scheduled to speak at another conference on Thursday.\nLonger-dated yields fell and the 10-year Treasury yield was down on the day after a $40 billion auction analysts viewed as acceptable given the increased size.\nEli Lilly shares climbed 3.2% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drugmaker's weight loss treatment.\nIn earnings, Warner Bros Discovery plunged 19% after the media and entertainment conglomerate said Hollywood strikes and a weak advertising market could hurt 2024 earnings, weighing on peer Paramount Global.\nTake-Two Interactive Software jumped 5.2% after the company said it would release a trailer early next month for the latest installment in its best-selling \"Grand Theft Auto\" videogame franchise.\nElectric vehicle maker Lucid Group stumbled 8.1% after trimming its production forecast.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.3-to-1 ratio on the NYSE while on the Nasdaq declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.7-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and eight new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 53 new highs and 206 new lows.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 10.27 billion shares, compared with the 10.95 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "text": "\nMOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Three major Greek shipping firms have stopped transporting Russian oil in recent weeks in order to avoid U.S. sanctions now being imposed on some shipping firms carrying Russian oil, four traders told Reuters and shipping data showed.\nThe development is a blow to Russia as it narrows the number of shipping firms that are ready to transport Russian oil to consumers in Asia, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa and South America - although traders said Moscow still had enough shipping firms for now.\nGreek shippers Minerva Marine, Thenamaris and TMS Tankers have stopped transporting Russia oil in recent weeks, the four traders said.\nThenamaris said it doesn't comment on commercial matters. Minerva Marine and TMS Tankers didn't respond to requests for comment.\nAll three firms were active shippers of Russian oil and fuels up until September-October when they started scaling down their involvement, according to the traders and data from shipping agents seen by Reuters.\nAll three companies turned down requests for vessels for Russian crude loading in November and later, said the traders, who previously collaborated with the three firms.\nThe Greek shippers' exit from the trade followed tighter U.S. sanctions imposed on Russian oil shipments.\nIn October, Washington imposed the first sanctions on owners of tankers in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates carrying Russian oil above the G7's price cap of $60 a barrel. Last week, it imposed sanctions on three more ships.\nThe G7 countries introduced a price cap on Russian oil in late 2022, but had not previously enforced it. The price cap allows Western firms to provide shipping and insurance services for Russian crude as long as the oil is sold below $60 per barrel. The cap is designed to limit Russian export revenues.\nRussia's main export grade, Urals, has been trading above the $60 per barrel cap since mid-July amid production cuts by the OPEC+ group of oil producing countries, prompting many market watchers to say the price cap wasn't working.\nRussia's Pacific ESPO Blend crude oil grade has also traded above the cap, according to U.S. Treasury data.\nThe three Greek firms had been shipping Russian oil for decades and continued to do so when most other Western companies quit running the routes to avoid rising sanction risks and the imposition of the price cap.\nThe routes have been lucrative. Russian oil trade has brought record revenues over the past year to the shippers who took the risk and stayed in the business.\nFreight rates for Russian oil transportation jumped to as high as $15 million per tanker voyage from Baltic ports to India last winter as shippers charged high rates because of the risk. That was several times more expensive than shipments of non-sanctioned crude.\nThe three Greek companies operate more than 100 oil tankers capable of handling almost all the oil exports from Russia's European ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga and Novorossiisk of roughly 10 million tonnes a month or 2.4 million barrels per day.\nThey also operate a fleet of smaller tankers that transport fuel.\n\"The dark fleet might not be enough to transport all of Russian oil,\" one of the traders involved in Russian oil shipping said, referring to the emergence of the so-called \"dark fleet\" of shippers that move oil from sanctions-hit Russia and Iran and are not covered by Western insurance.\nHe cited as the main reason the fact that the Russian oil was now travelling 8-10 weeks to reach customers in Asia as opposed to two weeks before sanctions, when oil was sold in Europe. That means more tankers are required for the trade.\nHowever, for now Russia appears to be coping as other shipping companies stepped in, traders said.\nRussia is now relying on its shipping company Sovcomflot and a many little-known shipping firms registered in the UAE, India, Hong Kong, Seychelles, Ghana and other locations, according to traders and shipping data.\nThe vessels carry flags of different states from Liberia to the Cook Islands.\n(Reporting by Reuters reporters in Moscow, Jonathan Saul and Dmitry Zhdannikov in London, additional reporting by Eleftherios Papadimas in Athens; Editing by Susan Fenton)",

        "text": "\nBy Steven Scheer\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Five weeks into Israel's war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, Israelis are spending less but a recovery may have begun after a steep drop at the start of the conflict, the Bank of Israel said on Tuesday.\nThe central bank said that since the war's outbreak, credit card spending - a key indicator of consumer expenditures that is more than half of economic output - is down 9% from its forecast level, but off a low of 20% after the first three weeks.\nIt said spending, based on daily data received from Israel's credit card processing firm, has slid on education, flights, hotels, car rentals, fuel, transport and restaurants, but risen in supermarkets due to what it called \"the public's initial concerns of a shortage of products\" and calls by authorities to stockpile food for 72 hours.\nThe Bank of Israel said that credit card data are crucial for monetary policy since much of the data necessary for making economic policy decisions do not exist in real time, and sometimes the lag is several weeks to a few months.\n\"Credit card expenditures are a real-time indicator of the level of business and consumer activity,\" it said. \"These data make it possible to lower the extent of uncertainty with which economic policy decisions are made, and their use is very important during a crisis when there is increased uncertainty.\"\nThe use of credit card spending data, the central bank said, also made it possible to assess the level of activity during the war compared with the past. Current data show spending similar to the second COVID lockdown in September 2020 but higher than the first lockdown at the start of the pandemic in March 2020.\nAssuming the Gaza war remains concentrated along Israel's southern border with the enclave and lasts until the end of the year, the central bank projects GDP growth to fall by about 1% in 2023 and 2024 - translating to growth of 2.3% this year and 2.8% next.\nIts projections are more optimistic than those of S&P Global Ratings, which on Monday estimated growth for Israel of 1.5% in 2023 and 0.5% in 2024, with a contraction of 5% in the current quarter. The bank said any drawing of other regional players into the war would \"have more significant repercussions for Israel's economy\".\nAccording to the Economy Ministry, 19% of Israel's active labour force are not working due to the war, as many of them have been called up for military reserve duty.\n(Reporting by Steven Scheer; editing by Mark Heinrich)",

Venture Global LNG has said the Louisiana plant is not fully operational due to faulty power equipment that is being repaired.\nTheir appeals sought to get The Hague and Washington to pressure Venture Global LNG on the contracts. In its letter, Shell accused Venture Global LNG of diverting resources into building a second LNG export plant rather than completing repairs to its first plant.\nThe behavior \"has shaken confidence in the trustworthiness of American LNG suppliers,\" BP executive Carol Howle wrote in a separate letter. Whether the plant should be allowed to operate and export under rules governing construction should be explored by officials, she added.\nNO ACTION BY TASK FORCE\nOfficials from the EU and U.S. indicated they view the dispute as \"a contractual matter between commercial parties,\" a Venture Global LNG spokesperson said on Saturday. No action was taken on Shell's request at an Oct. 30 task force meeting.\nA Shell spokesman said on Saturday it was not expecting an immediate reaction by the task force, and wanted to bring a potential loss of trust in U.S. LNG to officials' attention. BP declined comment apart from its letter. Utility giant Edison did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the weekend.\nVenture Global LNG is operating the Calcasieu Pass plant at capacity, it has told U.S. regulators. And it has sold more than 200 cargoes worth about $18.2 billion to date, according to a Reuters tally. Those sales reaped higher prices than would be available under the four firms' long-term contracts.\nShell and others claim the firm has profited from the rally in global gas markets while short-changing Europe's energy security. They have been told they will not receive their contracted amounts until late 2024.\nBP and Shell have bought gas from the plant and sold it outside of Europe while citing Europe's energy security in letters to the U.S.-EU task force, Venture Global LNG said. The company is \"diligently working toward full completion.\" It did not say when full commercial operation would begin.\n\"Shell has purchased 7 commissioning cargoes from Venture Global and 3 of them were traded outside of Europe for higher profits. Similarly, BP has purchased 6 commissioning cargos, and 2 have been traded to destinations outside of Europe,\" according to a Nov. 10 letter signed by Venture Global Co-Chairman Michael Sabel and Robert Pender.\nThe exporter is in compliance with terms of its contracts and the criticisms by BP and Shell represent an attempt to \"litigate this through our regulators and in the media,\" the letter said.\nThe appeal to the U.S.-EU task force also follows Repsol's bid to have the U.S. energy regulator Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reopen its approval of the Calcasieu plant in view of the startup problems. That request was rejected.\n(Reporting by Gary McWilliams; editing by Diane Craft)",

Venture Global and the foundation customers have been in a legal dispute over its failure to deliver cargoes from the facility to them.\n\"FERC is saying the facility is approved to operate at full capacity while commissioning remains ongoing on other plants. It aligns with Venture Global's desire to delay the start of commercial operations,\" said Munton.\nVenture Global LNG is involved in contract arbitration with customers Shell, BP, Edison and Repsol that separately seeks to force the company to supply them cargoes or pay financial penalties.\n\"We agree with the modified commissioning plan that no longer bundles\" the newer liquefaction trains with the faulty power and other portions of the Louisiana plant, FERC said.\nShell was pleased with the FERC decision to put the additional processing trains into operation, because it showed the facility is able to operate at or above capacity without the power equipment, said Shell's spokesman Curtis Smith.\n\"Venture Global should immediately begin deliveries to its foundational customers,\" said Smith.\nTheir support \"provided the agreements needed to secure the financing and construction of the facility,\" he said.\nVenture Global started gas processing at its Calcasieu Pass facility in March 2022 and has delivered at least 200 cargoes - which it says are \"pre-commissioning cargoes\" - through September, according to a Reuters tally.\nBut the company has not provided cargoes to its contract customers, insisting the facility is not fully commissioned.\nVenture Global's original commissioning plan included three phases. The third phase involves starting up liquefaction trains 7-9, pre-treatment systems and power generation, according to the FERC document said. The revised plan splits the last three trains from the other systems in the commissioning process.\nCommissioning activities so far have shown the liquefaction facilities can operate above the authorized nameplate capacity and near the maximum capacity, despite the heat recovery steam generator tube leaks affecting the plant, FERC said.\n\"We will continue to work closely with our regulators as we progress the remaining work and commissioning activities needed to complete the facility,\" said Venture Global LNG spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes.

Now, it\u2019s planning a revival. There\u2019s fresh money flowing in, producers are venturing into new areas and traditional growers are receiving financial aid.\n\u201cThere is a huge opportunity for Brazil to regain a leading role in the global cocoa supply chain,\u201d said Valmir Ortega, the founder of Belterra Agroflorestas, a company planting cocoa trees across degraded rainforest areas. They have the support of giants like Cargill Inc. and an investment fund created by Vale SA.\nBrazil is looking to double cocoa production by 2030. That\u2019s one of the goals from a plan the country\u2019s cocoa commission Ceplac is announcing this week. As soon as 2025, Brazil should be producing enough to satisfy domestic demand, according to director Lucimara Chiari. That would reduce Brazil\u2019s need to import beans, helping ease a severe global shortage of the chocolate ingredient.\n\u201cOf all cocoa producing countries, Brazil has the greatest growth potential,\u201d Chiari said.\nThe development is much needed relief for the cocoa market, which has suffered from bad weather and crop disease in top growers Ivory Coast and Ghana. Such setbacks have dramatically shrunk global inventories, causing cocoa futures to soar almost 70% this year. The price for the most-active contract in London climbed for a second straight day on Friday to as high as \u00a33,476 per metric ton.\nCocoaAction Brasil mapped at least 24 ongoing projects to aid the local cocoa supply chain, with a total investment of over 150 million Brazilian reais ($30.6 million).\nRead More: Brace for Pricier Chocolate If Africa\u2019s Cocoa Crop Disappoints\nThe Brazil cocoa boom is already more than just a promise. Farmers in different areas of the country are planting new trees, which will bear fruit in the next two to three years.\nOne of those farmers is Moises Schmidt, who recently planted cocoa in Barreiras, a municipality of Bahia state located almost 600 miles (966 kilometers) away from traditional cocoa areas. He is now expanding plantations in partnership with Cargill. It\u2019s a marked shift for the family business Schmidt Agricola, which for over forty years specialized in growing cotton, soybeans and corn.\n\u201cCocoa farming was stuck in the past,\u201d Schmidt said. In contrast to the more traditional craft methods, his company made efforts to use new machinery and invest in seedlings that can resist the drier weather of his region. \u201cThat\u2019s the future.\u201d\nCocoa has become such a hot topic that even a biofuels company is now looking to produce the chocolate ingredient. Brasil Biofuels SA focuses on fuel made from palm oil, but started to add cocoa plants to its tree nursery, hoping to cultivate 1,000 hectares next year.\nTo be sure, Brazilian cocoa production is still a fraction of what is grown in Africa, a continent that accounts for almost three quarters of global supply. What makes Brazil relevant is the fact that at least some of its farmers have the means to respond to heightened global demand by boosting supplies, whereas in Africa many farmers live below the poverty line and their pay is set by authorities, so they don\u2019t immediately benefit from higher futures prices. Producers need money to invest, especially as new European rules require spending on traceability to prove crops weren\u2019t grown in deforested land.\nA larger Brazilian production could bring down cocoa prices, although that would only be a factor in the long term, analysts at the Hightower Report said Friday. For now, prices continue to be driven by the poor outlook in West Africa.\nProductivity of Brazilian farms is also lower than in Africa, but it has been improving, said Pedro Ronca, an agronomist and manager at the CocoaAction Brasil initiative. Many areas were still lacking the basic investments in soil treatments, as well as proper tree care. Providing farmers with access to financing and technical assistance is leading to significant yield gains, he said.\nPerhaps the biggest threat to Brazil\u2019s ambitious cocoa plans still lies in tree health. More than 30 years after the first deadly outbreak, a new disease called frosty pod rot is haunting farmers. Fighting such risk will require even more investments, said Anna Paula Losi, chief executive officer of industry group AIPC. She believes Brazilians are up for the job.\n\u201cWe have better knowledge and resources now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not the same.\u201d\n(Updates cocoa futures price in sixth paragraph, adds analysts comment in 13th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Airbnb Inc. and Bookings Holdings Inc. also rose, closing up 6.2% and 0.7% respectively.\nThe travel companies said on conference calls that consumers continue to spend on leisure travel despite inflationary pressure. They posted better-than-expected third-quarter results, buoyed by the strong summer travel season.\nAsia Pacific showed a strong recovery and recorded relatively faster growth than other regions as the last of the pandemic-related global travel restrictions have come down, allowing consumers to travel across borders and return to high-density urban destinations.\nExpedia announced a new $5 billion share buyback authorization, along with its upbeat results, and reiterated its full-year outlook for double-digit revenue growth with margin expansion.\nExpedia\u2019s executives also signaled confidence in further benefits from a years-long technical upgrade and a new loyalty program. That\u2019s despite missing on a bookings metric due to the fires in Maui, Hawaii.\nFor the fourth quarter, Expedia expects gross bookings growth to be relatively in line with third-quarter levels. The company sees modest acceleration in revenue growth, taking into account the uncertain geopolitical environment.\nAirbnb gave a disappointing outlook that indicated further deceleration in revenue growth and nights booked. It will be monitoring macro and geopolitical factors that could reduce travel demand as it saw early volatility and broad softness in the period.\nStill, the shares finished up 7.5% for the week.\nBookings Holdings, which has relatively bigger exposure to markets outside the US and especially the Middle East compared to peers, reported cancellations in Israel and a drop in bookings outside the country in October as people around the world absorbed the news about the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nThe company, the parent of Priceline and Kayak, said room night growth recovered toward the end of the month and its fourth-quarter outlook for that metric was slightly ahead of estimates.\nTravel Resilience\nThe companies remain upbeat about travel demand for the year ahead and the long term.

At Morgan Stanley, the sustainability research team is monitoring carbon regulations that are likely to inflate costs for companies. Meanwhile, Fidelity International Ltd. has started to account for Europe\u2019s impending taxes on carbon-intensive imports.\nPolitical debates about ESG aside, the rising price of carbon is a growing threat to returns. Half of the earnings for companies in the MSCI World Index are at risk of declining if global carbon prices reach $100 a ton by 2030, according to estimates by researchers at Lombard Odier. As of now, the price of carbon is less than $30 a ton, but Europe\u2019s new tariffs on carbon-intensive imports may hasten an increase, the Swiss asset manager said.\nEurope\u2019s so-called carbon border adjustment mechanism, or CBAM, is designed to create a level playing field by making sure that imports of certain goods are subject to the same carbon prices as domestic producers pay in Europe. While it doesn\u2019t take full effect until 2026, CBAM will likely \u201cpromote the rise and convergence of carbon prices towards the EU\u2019s level,\u201d which is about \u20ac75 ($82) a ton, Lorenzo Bernasconi, Lombard Odier\u2019s head of carbon solutions, said in a report.\nFor companies, there\u2019s a potential double whammy, as higher carbon prices mean higher operating costs and the CBAM tariffs mean higher expenses for importing carbon-intensive raw materials into Europe.\nRead More: How EU Will Charge for Emissions Outside Its Borders: QuickTake\nAs CBAM takes shape, \u201cwe are starting to build into our model how this additional tax is going to impact\u201d future cash flows, Flora Wang, Fidelity\u2019s head of stewardship in Asia, who\u2019s also a portfolio manager, said in an interview. As a result, she said Fidelity is reconsidering whether to invest in a big Chinese manufacturer of fertilizer and pesticides, one of the first industries subject to the new import taxes.\nWang didn\u2019t name the company. It has strong fundamentals and a near-monopoly, but a lot of its feed material is tied to coal refining, which means high emissions, and a big market of this company is in Europe, she said.\nCBAM is prompting other countries to consider enacting their own measures. The UK is weighing a similar mechanism, while others plan to raise carbon taxes rather than lose tax revenue to Europe.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more emissions trading markets across the globe, which is putting an explicit price on carbon emissions for a lot of the companies,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThat goes directly into the cost structure of a lot of companies we\u2019re investing in.\u201d\nTim Chan, Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of sustainability research for Asia-Pacific ex-Japan, said he and his team are watching Europe, because if its tariffs are \u201csuccessfully implemented, then there would be more incentive for China and Japan to gradually have a higher carbon price.\u201d Both countries currently have local emissions trading schemes, though volumes and prices remain relatively low.\nAt Invesco, the firm has begun inputting a range of carbon prices into its aggregated investment portfolios to simulate different future scenarios, said Alexander Chan, Asia-Pacific head of ESG client strategy.

        "text": "\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Disney on Tuesday released a study showing its economic impact in Florida at $40.3 billion as it battles Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his appointees over their takeover of the district that governs the entertainment company's massive theme park resort in central Florida.\nDisney accounted for 263,000 jobs in Florida, more than three times the actual workforce at Walt Disney World, according to the study conducted by Oxford Economics and commissioned by Disney, covering fiscal year 2022. Besides direct employment and spending, the study attributed the company\u2019s multibillion-dollar impact to indirect influences, such as supply chain and employees\u2019 spending.\nThe jobs include Disney employees as well as jobs supported by visitor spending off Disney World property. Disney employs 82,000 workers in Florida, not only at Disney World outside Orlando, but also Disney Cruise Line in Port Canaveral, Fort Lauderdale and Miami, as well as a resort in Vero Beach.\nIn central Florida, Disney directly accounts for 1 in 8 jobs, and for every direct job, another 1.7 jobs are supported across Florida, Oxford Economics said.\nThe time period in the study is before the takeover earlier this year of Disney World's governing district by DeSantis and his appointees after Disney publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\nDisney officials in the past year have said the company plans to invest an additional $17 billion over the next decade in central Florida, including potentially adding another 13,000 jobs. However, the company has shown a willingness to pull back investing in the Sunshine State. Earlier this year, Disney scrapped plans to relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development, an investment estimated at $1 billion.\nDisney World already has four theme parks, more than 25 hotels, two water parks and a shopping and dining district on 25,000 acres (10,117 hectares).\nDisney is battling DeSantis and his appointees in federal and state courts over the takeover of what was formally called the Reedy Creek Improvement District but was renamed the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District after DeSantis appointees gained control. The district was created by the Florida Legislature in 1967 to handle municipal services like firefighting, road repairs and waste hauling, and it was controlled by Disney supporters until earlier this year.\nBefore control of the district changed hands from Disney allies to DeSantis appointees, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees said the \u201celeventh-hour deals\u201d neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided. Disney has filed counterclaims, which include asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable.\nDisney also has sued DeSantis, a state agency and DeSantis appointees on the district's board in federal court in Tallahassee, saying the company's free speech rights were violated when the governor and Republican lawmakers targeted it for expressing opposition to the law dubbed \u201cDon't Say Gay\u201d by its critics.\nIn an earnings report last week, Disney noted that while its theme parks worldwide had a year-to-year increase in operating income, it had decreased at the Florida theme park resort due to costs related to the closure of its immersive Star Wars-themed two-night experience and lower visitor spending from a decrease in hotel rates.\n___\nFollow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP.",

Britain too has seen a jump in enquiries about the pests.\nIn South Korea, about 30 cases of suspected infestations have been reported nationwide, including at a traditional Korean spa called \"jjimjilbang\" in Incheon, west of Seoul, and a college dorm in the southeastern city of Daegu, officials said.\nThe prime minister's office on Tuesday launched a four-week campaign with inspections of public facilities and pest control measures.\n\"Public anxiety is inevitable as reports continue to come in,\" Park Ku-yeon, first deputy chief of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, who heads the team in change of the campaign, told a meeting.\nPark singled out small dorm rooms known as \"gosiwon\" and single-room households as most vulnerable, calling for support from district authorities.\nThe wingless insects hide in mattresses and bedding and feed on blood, typically biting at night.\nSouth Korea's hotel and tour industry is stepping up vigilance with distribution of repellent and training for staff.\nLotte Hotels and Resorts, a hospitality arm of Lotte Corp , said it had not found any infestations but issued guidelines to all branches and it plans to disinfect bedding, mattresses, carpets and sofas.\n\"We're trying to take strong precautionary steps,\" a Lotte Hotel official told Reuters.\nAuthorities in the capital, Seoul, said metro operators would disinfect trains more frequently and gradually replace fabric seats with plastic ones.\nDrivers have to disinfect their taxis twice a day and control measures are also being implemented on buses.

A spokeswoman for Garantex, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in April last year, said the company welcomed initiatives \"to fight cybercrime around the world\" and encouraged Elliptic and others to share information about the hackers' finances, saying suspicious funds would be blocked.\nElliptic co-founder Tom Robinson said the massive haul made Black Basta \"one of the most profitable ransomware strains of all time.\" He said the researchers came up with the figure by identifying known ransom payments tied to the group and tracing how the digital currency was laundered, which revealed additional payments.\nRobert McArdle, a cybercrime expert with security firm TrendMicro who was not involved in the report, said the Black Basta figure was \"certainly in a believable range for their operations.\"\nThe Elliptic-Corvus report said it had also uncovered evidence tying Black Basta to the defunct Russian group \"Conti.\"\nConti used to be among the top ransomware gangs - operators that shook down victims either by encrypting their data and demanding money to unscramble it, by threatening to publish stolen information to the web, or both.\nThe Russia-based group dismantled its leak site after the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 and the posting of U.S. bounties on its leadership that year but researchers have long suspected that the group merely reorganized and rebranded.\n\"Conti was perhaps the most successful ransomware gang we've seen,\" Robinson said. The latest findings suggest that \"some of the individuals responsible are replicating its success with the Black Basta ransomware,\" he added.\n(Reporting by Raphael Satter; Additional reporting by James Pearson in London; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Richard Chang and Mark Porter)",

That followed an announcement by DNB that it intends to redeem the notes by the end of February.\nThe decision is a surprise twist in a long-standing saga that pitted investors against the bank. DNB wanted to keep the bonds as a cheap source of money, betting on a potential rule by the Norwegian finance ministry to create a place in its capital structure for this obsolete type of debt. Instead, bondholders look set for a windfall given they were trading at a deep discount.\nThe perpetual notes were sold back in the mid-1980s as a source of regulatory capital. After multiple changes in bank regulations over the years, they lost this status, but wafer-thin spreads made them attractive to hold on to. The bank\u2019s management repeatedly stated its commitment to keeping them outstanding.\nThe move \u201cwill delight bondholders,\u201d wrote Jennifer Ray, head of northern European banks at credit research firm CreditSights, Inc., in a note. \u201cThe expected amendment to Norwegian law previously relied upon in DNB\u2019s original decision not to redeem the instruments will not now go ahead.\u201d\nThor Tellefsen, head of long term funding at DNB, declined to comment.\nEarlier this year, DNB launched a vote to change the rate used on the bonds to calculate interest from the now-dead Libor to a replacement rate. Investors, who had been grappling with a lack of clarity on where these junior bonds sit if the bank failed, rejected it.\nThe price of a similar bond by BNP Paribas SA, which has also remained outstanding over four decades, jumped 1.5 cent on the dollar to about 94 cents after the DNB announcement, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.\n(Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph, bond move in eighth.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nWhy America\u2019s Wind Power Failures Are Good for GE\nNo One Told AI Startups That San Francisco Is Over\nPeter Thiel Is Still Hoping That Donald Trump Just Fades Away\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased by nearly 0.2% or close to 60 points.\nRecent signs of a weaker US economy signaled to the market that the Fed could ease up on its rate hikes. But central bankers have said that the door is still open to additional increases, even if officials decide to pause for a time.\nAnd while the market's momentum has swung to a more optimistic reading, investors have plenty of cautious voices to check their exuberance, including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who emphasized both Monday and Tuesday that the central bank likely has more work ahead of it to control inflation. Kashkari was one of several more hawkish members of the Fed to express caution on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak later in the week.\nRead more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\"There was quite a bit of euphoria at the end of last week on the belief that the Fed is done, the jobs market is slowing, that the US economy is going to experience a soft landing,\" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, told Reuters. \"People have started to become a bit more clear-eyed. There is the risk that the Fed could rise again.\"\nThe fresh Fed doubts clouded the outlook for oil, helping push WTI crude prices below $80 a barrel for the first time in over two months despite the prospect of Saudi and Russian supply cuts. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) and Brent crude futures (BZ=F) both sank 4%, to $77.48 and $81.76 a barrel, respectively.\nAlso dragging on oil was trade data showing China's drop in exports unexpectedly accelerated in October, a sign of flagging overseas demand, while its imports rose. But there was a bright spot for the world's second-biggest economy, as the IMF upgraded its GDP growth forecasts for the country this year and next.\nIn corporate news, WeWork (WE) on Monday filed for bankruptcy after the once most valuable US startup grappled with expensive leases. Its shares have fallen about 98% this year.\nMeanwhile, earnings season continues with reports from Uber (UBER) and Rivian (RIVN) highlighting Tuesday's docket, ahead of the closely watched Disney (DIS) results due Wednesday.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) increased for the seventh consecutive session, extending a win streak as investors banked on the Federal Reserve holding rates steady heading into the end of the year. The S&P rose by nearly 0.3%\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.9%, notching its eighth straight day of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.17% or almost 60 points.\nWall Street has been skeptical about how much Disney (DIS) can charge for a new ESPN streaming service it's planning to launch. But the company's former streaming chief says sports fans will be willing to pay \u2014 even if the price tag is higher than what most platforms currently cost.\n\"People have always paid a lot for sports,\" Kevin Mayer, who now runs Blackstone-backed entertainment startup Candle Media, said at the Yahoo Finance Invest Conference on Tuesday. \"They didn't always know it because back in the day when 95% of this country had paid TV bundles, probably 40% to 50% of the cost of that bundle was sports programming. ... [But] now they can do so explicitly.\"\nHis comments come as Disney's stock has hit multiyear lows and activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing for multiple board seats at the company. The company's parks business is slowing, its linear TV division is declining, and its streaming business is not yet profitable.\nMayer, who is currently serving as a strategic adviser to CEO Bob Iger, said his former boss is \"definitely most focused on making sure that ESPN, a company that he really believes in strongly, is well positioned for the future.\"\nDisney hasn\u2019t disclosed any details regarding pricing for the ESPN service, although analysts have estimated it would need to cost a minimum of around $30 a month in order to break even \u2014 let alone turn a profit.\nMayer, however, insisted that $30 a month is an \"entirely reasonable price to get the full suite of sports that ESPN would offer.\"\nRead more here.\nA substantial drop in inflation that comes without triggering a recession is still a possibility, said Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee.\n\"Over the next couple of months, we might equal the fastest drop in inflation in the last century,\" Goolsbee said Tuesday, during in an interview with CNBC. \"So we're making progress on the inflation rate.\"\nGoolsbee noted that in previous battles against inflation a recession usually followed when central bankers had to greatly reduce pricing pressures. But achieving a soft landing in this tightening cycle would achieve what has not previously been done, he said, because of the magnitude of the inflation drop that would be required.\nHe also noted that if the Fed continues to make progress on the inflation front, the debate will shift from whether to rise rates to how long to keep rates elevated.\nCredit card balances rose by $48 billion in the third quarter to a record high of $1.08 trillion, according to data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The $154 billion year-over-year gain in debt was the largest such increase since the beginning of the series in 1999. At the same time, the 90-day delinquency rate measure for credit cardholders increased to 5.78%, up from 3.69% a year earlier, Yahoo Finance's Gabriella Cruz-Martinez reports.\nRising delinquencies spanned incomes and regions, the data showed, but they were particularly acute among millennials and those with auto or student loans.\nThe fresh data comes as the three-year federal student loan payment pause ended in October and interest rates on credit cards have increased to 38-year highs. The combination has been a blow to some borrowers saddled with credit card debt.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page in afternoon trading on Tuesday:\nIntel (INTC): Shares of the multinational tech company rose 2% Tuesday afternoon following a report from the Wall Street Journal that revealed the company is in the running to potentially receive billions of dollars in government funding for secure facilities producing microchips for US military and intelligence applications.\nARM (ARM): Arm shares rose by more than 3% following reports that Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) are both planning to launch Arm-based central processing units (CPUs) for Windows-based PCs.\nDatadog (DDOG): Shares surged nearly 30% Tuesday afternoon after the security software company beat profit expectations and delivered a positive outlook as more customers transition to the cloud seeking more robust security solutions amid heightened cybersecurity threats.\nPlanet Fitness: (PLNT): Shares of the gym chain climbed more than 12% Tuesday after reporting a nearly 14% increase in total revenue from last year on growth in same-store sales and more than two dozen new clubs.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on track to notch its seventh consecutive day of wins, if it holds on to its gains through the closing bell. The index rose 0.2% in afternoon trading.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by about 0.7%, on target to record its eighth straight day of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just over the flatline.\nStrong showings from corporate America are generally moving stocks upward again.\nThe 710 companies that reported quarterly results last week saw a 2.3% gain in the trading session following their release, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That's one of the best readings in the last 20 years, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports.\nBut it's not the earnings themselves that have changed investor behavior, but rather the shifting narrative that has renewed hopes on Wall Street that the Fed is close to ending its rate hiking campaign.\nAs the current market consensus has shifted over the past several trading sessions, investors appear less worried about the headwinds that drove stocks lower in October. As of late-morning Tuesday, markets were pricing in a 90% chance the Fed holds interest rates steady in December, up significantly from the roughly 58% chance seen a month ago.\nAnthony Capuano, the chief executive of Marriott, said the hotel chain is dedicated to the Middle East market, even as the conflict in Israel and Gaza carries the potential for broader regional instability. \"We've got a robust pipeline across the region,\" Capuano said during a live interview at Yahoo Finance Invest, adding that keeping guests within the hotel ecosystem is a top priority. Marriott has more than two dozen hotels in Lebanon and Egypt.\nCapuano also emphasized the company's growth in China, its second-largest market. The operating environment there, he said, \"is more than fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\" Marriott recently opened its 500th hotel in China, he said, and has plans to open another 400 properties.\nWhile the US and China are grappling with heightened economic and national security tensions, Capuano said his company has been able to stay above the geopolitical fray because Marriott is an asset-light business.\nOf the 500 hotels in Marriott's China portfolio and the hundreds more on the way, most of the properties are \"almost entirely China-owned,\" he said.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page in morning trading on Tuesday:\nDatadog (DDOG): Shares surged 24% Tuesday morning after the security software company beat profit expectations and delivered a positive outlook as more customers transition to the cloud seeking more robust security solutions amid heightened cybersecurity threats.\nPlanet Fitness: (PLNT): Shares of the gym chain climbed more than 15% Tuesday after reporting a nearly 14% increase in total revenue from last year on growth in same-store sales and more than two dozen new clubs.\nWeWork (WORK): Trading on the co-working space provider remains halted as the former high-flying startup is expected to file for bankruptcy after its value plunged from $50 billion. The company warned investors in August that its financial troubles may force the company to shutter, punctuating what has been a disastrous run as a public company. It's last price was below $1.\nPeloton (PTON): The troubled connected fitness company edged up less than 1% Tuesday morning after investors sent the company down more than 5% in premarket trading. The rollercoaster moves came after Deutsche Bank downgraded Peloton to Hold from Buy as it sought clarity on its growth outlook.\nWall Street couldn't keep up the surge that fueled last week's rally, as pessimism over the potential for future rate hikes overtook hopes of an end to the Fed's tightening campaign.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by about 0.3%, continuing on a win-streak path, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged down by 0.06%.

        "text": "\nThe removal of contaminated soil from the eastern Ohio site of February's fiery Norfolk Southern derailment is expected to be completed sometime this weekend, although the larger cleanup effort isn't over.\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials and the railroad announced the milestone Thursday in East Palestine. It comes nearly nine months after the derailment forced thousands from their homes near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Area residents still have lingering fears about potential health effects from the assortment of toxic chemicals that spilled, and the vinyl chloride that was released a few days after the crash to keep five tank cars from exploding.\nThe derailment has inspired nationwide worries about railroad safety and prompted members of Congress and regulators to propose reforms, however that bill has largely stalled.\nSince the Feb. 3 derailment, the railroad has removed more than 167,000 tons of contaminated soil and more than 39 million gallons of tainted water from the site where hazardous materials spilled and were released from tank cars.\nThe end of the soil removal will significantly cut down on heavy truck traffic in East Palestine. Officials were also able to reopen Taggart Street to the public near the derailment site this week.\nOfficials with both the state and federal Environmental Protection Agencies will still oversee the remaining cleanup work, which includes backfilling in excavated areas and assessing chemical contamination in the area's creeks. Residents post pictures regularly of a chemical sheen on water in the streams anytime the creekbed is disturbed.\nRegional EPA administrator Debra Shore promised that her agency will make sure all the contamination is gone before signing off on the cleanup.\nThe railroad's CEO Alan Shaw also promised to see the cleanup through.\n\u201cNorfolk Southern is committed to remaining in East Palestine for the long haul,\u201d Shaw said.\nRegular testing of the air and water will still take place too. Officials have said those tests consistently showed it's safe although many residents remain uneasy.\nNorfolk Southern said earlier this week that the costs associated with the derailment have grown to nearly $1 billion, a figure that will keep climbing as more legal settlements and fines are agreed to and the cleanup carries on. That total includes more than $96 million the railroad has pledged to residents and the community to help them recover.",

That was expanded to all ports on Friday at 12 a.m. (1100 GMT)\nA spokesperson from the union Transport, which counts the dockworkers as its members, said that Swedish ports often saw one to three shipments of Tesla cars a week, but no shipments had arrived since the start of the strike.\n\"So the blockade is working,\" the spokesperson said.\nU.S.-based Tesla, which has revolutionised the electric car market, has managed to avoid collective bargaining agreements, which cover wages and conditions, with its roughly 127,000 workers and Musk has been vocal about his opposition to unions.\nMarie Nilsson, head of IF Metall, told Reuters on Friday that the union had received some indications early on in the dispute that Tesla was engaging in strike-breaking tactics by flying in workers from other countries.\n\"We have never experienced anything like this before... we haven't dealt with this in Sweden since 1937 or so,\" Nilsson says.\n\"And this has forced us to escalate the conflict,\" she added.\nIf Sweden can break Tesla's resistance, that could provide a precedent for other countries.\nSo far, unions in the United States and Germany have failed to force the carmaker to accept collective bargaining agreements.\n\"If they have come to Sweden, they must follow the rules. We have certain norms here and he (Musk) must accept them,\" Torbjorn Johansson, negotiation secretary at Sweden's LO labour confederation, said.\n\"Swedish workers cannot afford to lose this fight.\"\nSwedish unions have achieved success before getting foreign firms to accept local industrial practices.\nIn the 1990s, American toy company Toys \"R\" Us signed a collective bargaining agreement with its 130 Swedish employees after a three-month strike.\nNilsson said IF Metall had no plans to stop the strike action anytime soon.\n\"As long as it is needed,\" she said.\nIn addition to dockworkers, unionised cleaners are refusing to clean Tesla buildings and postal workers have stopped delivering mail.\nOn Friday, electricians stopped service and repair work for Tesla, including at its charging stations across Sweden.\nSwedish workers are also supported by Norway's Fellesforbundet, the biggest union in the country's LO confederation.\nAction against Tesla in Sweden is due to escalate further - if no agreement is reached - on Nov. 24 when about 50 unionised workers at Hydro Extrusions, a subsidiary of Norwegian aluminium and energy company Hydro, will stop work on Tesla car products.\nTesla has not responded to repeated requests for comment.

Thursday's economic data suggested that the Federal Reserve is likely done raising interest rates and may start easing by the middle of next year, typically a dollar-negative factor. Euro weakness after a soft euro zone inflation report also partly helped boost the greenback, analysts said. The dollar index, which measures its value against six major currencies, rose 0.6% to 103.38 and was on track to post its best daily gain in more than a month. On a monthly basis, the dollar has posted a 3% loss, on pace for its worst monthly showing in a year. Some analysts said the dollar may have benefited from month-end demand, as investors squared up positions for November, a period that featured a sharp sell-off in the U.S. currency with the market pricing in rate cuts next year. Others, however, expected a dollar sell-off at month-end with stocks' sharp gains for November. There were sell dollar signals at some of the biggest U.S. banks, analysts said. \"We were expecting dollar selling at month-end given how much U.S. equities rallied. That typically means foreign asset managers would have sold dollars forward,\" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist, at UBS in New York. \"But it's possible that some of the selling happened earlier in the month. So maybe there's less dollar selling at month end.\" Dollar gains persisted despite reports that showed U.S. inflation continued to moderate in October and jobless claims rose in the latest week suggesting a slowing labor market. Inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was unchanged in October after climbing 0.4% in September. In the 12 months through October, the PCE price index increased 3.0%. That was the smallest year-on-year gain since March 2021 and followed a 3.4% advance in September. Meanwhile, initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 218,000 for the week ended Nov. 25. Economists had forecast 226,000 claims. In other currencies, the euro fell after euro zone inflation eased by more than forecast this month, fuelling bets of early European Central Bank rate cuts. Consumer price growth in the 20 countries that share the euro currency dropped to 2.4% in November from 2.9% in October, well below expectations for a fall to 2.7%. The euro last changed hands at $1.0889 against the dollar, down 0.7%. It is still poised to show a monthly gain of 3%, the largest since November 2022. Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.7% to 148.20 yen. For November, the greenback was down 2.3%, on pace for its largest monthly fall since December last year. \"The broader picture is that the dollar has weakened quite substantially in November. It's still probably a two-way risk from here in terms of the Fed December meeting,\" Serebriakov of UBS said. \"The U.S. data hasn't slowed significantly. Inflation has but activity data remains relatively resilient,\" he added. U.S. rate futures have priced in about a 47% chance of a rate cut at the March 19-20, 2024 meeting, rising to about 78% probability at the April 30-May 1 meeting, the CME FedWatch Tool showed on Thursday. Overall, the rates market sees roughly 100 basis points (bps) of cuts by the end of 2024, according to LSEG data. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 4:30PM (2130 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Dollar index 103.4800 102.8200 +0.66% -0.010% +103.5900 +102.7100 Euro/Dollar $1.0887 $1.0969 -0.75% +1.61% +$1.0984 +$1.0879 Dollar/Yen 148.1800 147.2400 +0.64% +13.02% +148.5000 +146.8500 Euro/Yen 161.34 161.51 -0.11% +15.00% +161.9400 +160.6000 Dollar/Swiss 0.8753 0.8737 +0.19% -5.33% +0.8770 +0.8681 Sterling/Dollar $1.2625 $1.2695 -0.55% +4.40% +$1.2710 +$1.2604 Dollar/Canadian 1.3564 1.3589 -0.18% +0.11% +1.3626 +1.3553 Aussie/Dollar $0.6607 $0.6617 -0.14% -3.07% +$0.6650 +$0.6571 Euro/Swiss 0.9529 0.9585 -0.58% -3.70% +0.9590 +0.9474 Euro/Sterling 0.8621 0.8640 -0.22% -2.52% +0.8649 +0.8615 NZ $0.6155 $0.6156 +0.00% -3.05% +$0.6182 +$0.6123 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway 10.8050 10.6310 +1.84% +10.32% +10.8240 +10.6690 Euro/Norway 11.7625 11.6879 +0.64% +12.09% +11.7848 +11.6717 Dollar/Sweden 10.4919 10.3624 +0.59% +0.81% +10.5397 +10.3450 Euro/Sweden 11.4228 11.3560 +0.59% +2.45% +11.4840 +11.3576 (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Samuel Indyk in London; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Alexander Smith and Deepa Babington)",

Meijer\nLUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -An EU tribunal made legal errors when it ruled in favour of Apple over a 13-billion-euro ($14 billion) tax order and should review the case again, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday, in a potential setback for the iPhone maker.\nThe tax case against Apple was part of EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's crackdown against deals between multinationals and EU countries that regulators saw as unfair state aid.\nThe European Commission in its 2016 decision said Apple benefited from two Irish tax rulings for more than two decades that artificially reduced its tax burden to as low as 0.005% in 2014.\nThe European Union's General Court in 2020 upheld Apple's challenge, saying that regulators had not met the legal standard to show Apple had enjoyed an unfair advantage.\nBut advocate General Giovanni Pitruzzella at the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) disagreed, saying CJEU judges should set aside the General Court ruling and refer the case back to the lower tribunal.\n\"The judgment of the General Court on 'tax rulings' adopted by Ireland in relation to Apple should be set aside,\" he said in a non-binding opinion.\nHe said the General Court committed a series of errors in law and had also failed \"to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors that, according to the Commission decision, vitiated the tax rulings\".\n\"It is therefore necessary for the General Court to carry out a new assessment,\" Pitruzzella said.\nThe CJEU, which will rule in the coming months, follows around four in five such recommendations.\nIreland reiterated that it had not provided any state aid to Apple.\n\"It is important to bear in mind that this opinion does not form part of the Court of Justice of the European Union judgment but is considered by the Court when arriving at its final ruling,\" Michael McGrath said in a statement.\n\"It has always been, and remains, Ireland's position that the correct amount of Irish tax was paid and that Ireland provided no state aid to Apple.\"\nWhile Apple and Dublin appealed against the tax order, Apple nevertheless had to hand over the full amount, which Ireland has been holding in an escrow account.\nThe Irish government has long said that even if it loses the its appeal and gets to keep the money, other EU member states will make claims that they are owed some of the back taxes.\n\"We thank the court for its time and ongoing consideration in this case. The General Court\u2019s ruling was very clear that Apple received no selective advantage and no state aid, and we believe that should be upheld,\" an Apple spokesperson said.\nVestager has had a mixed record defending her tax cases in court, with judges backing challenges by automaker Stellantis, Amazon and Starbucks.\nHer biggest legal victory to date came in September when the General Court upheld her decision against a 700-million-euro Belgian tax scheme for 55 multinationals. Her tax crackdown has forced EU countries to scrap such sweetheart deals.\nVestager is currently investigating IKEA brand owner Inter IKEA's Dutch tax arrangement in a case dating from 2017, Nike's Dutch tax rulings and Finnish food and drink packaging company Huhtamaki's tax rulings granted by Luxembourg.\nThe Apple case is C-465/20 P Commission v Ireland and Others.\n($1 = 0.9346 euros)",

(AP) \u2014 Daryl Hall has sued his longtime music partner John Oates, arguing that his plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged.\nThe move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale while legal proceedings and a previously initiated arbitration continue.\nA Nashville chancery court judge issued the temporary restraining order on Nov. 16, writing that Oates and others involved in his trust can't move to close the sale of their share of Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave IP Investment Management LLC until an arbitrator in a separately filed case weighs in on the deal, or until the judge's order expires \u2014 typically within 15 days, unless a judge extends the deadline.\nChancellor Russell Perkins issued the order the same day Hall filed his lawsuit, which was largely brought forth under seal, obscuring most details. An order Wednesday by the judge allowed more filings to be made public, though many details about the pair's business agreement and the proposed sale remain under wraps.\nWriting in favor of sealing certain filings, Hall's attorneys reasoned that it's a private dispute under an agreement with confidential terms, concerning a confidential arbitration process.\nAlthough the publicly released version of the lawsuit didn\u2019t specify what\u2019s at stake in the sale, Primary Wave has already owned \u201csignificant interest\u201d in Hall and Oates\u2019 song catalog for more than 15 years. In a 2021 interview with Sky News, Hall alluded to disappointment with the sale of his back catalog.\n\u201cOh, in the early days, it got sold off for me and I didn\u2019t get the money,\u201d he said. In the same interview, he advised artists to retain their publishing rights, saying \u201call you have is that.\u201d\nThe lawsuit contends that Hall opened an arbitration process on Nov. 9 against Oates and the other defendants in the lawsuit, Oates' wife, Aimee Oates, and Richard Flynn, in their roles as co-trustees of Oates' trust. Hall was seeking an order preventing them from selling their part in Whole Oats Enterprises to Primary Wave Music.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Oates' team intimated at the time that the sale could close within days, although no arbitrator had been picked yet to sort through the conflict.\nThe lawsuit says Oates' team entered into a letter of intent with Primary Wave Music for the sale, and alleges further that the letter makes clear that the music duo's business agreement was disclosed to Primary Wave Music in violation of a confidentiality provision.\n\u201cThus, the entire Unauthorized Transaction is the product of an indisputable breach of contract,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nThe case will be taken up at a Nov. 30 court hearing.\nThe Associated Press sent emails to attorneys for both parties and to representatives for Primary Wave Music on Friday. Still unclear is whether the dispute centers on the music catalog of Hall & Oates, a soft-rock-and-pop duo best known for its No. 1 hits \u201cPrivate Eyes,\u201d \u201cRich Girl\u201d and \u201cManeater.\"\nDaryl Hall and John Oates got their start as Temple University students before signing with Atlantic Records in 1972. In the decades since, they have achieved six platinum albums and many more Top 10 singles with their unique approach to blue-eyed soul. Hall & Oates was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 and its latest album, \u201cHome for Christmas,\u201d was released in 2006. The duo continued to perform as of last year.\n\u201cWe have this incredibly good problem of having so many hits,\u201d Oates told the AP in 2021, just before resuming a national tour that had been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s not a chore to play those songs because they are really great.\u201d\n___\nSherman reported from Copperas Cove, Texas.",

The report states that allergic diseases such as asthma are a growing concern in the U.S. cannabis industry, which has grown rapidly in recent years thanks to a wave of state-level legalizations.\nThe report said the worker's death \u201cillustrates missed opportunities for prevention, including workplace exposures, medical surveillance, and treatment according to the current asthma guidelines.\u201d\nThe report also states that evaluation of workers with new-onset or worsening asthma is essential in cannabis facilities. That approach could help prevent workplace deaths when paired \u201cwith prompt diagnosis and medical management,\u201d the report states.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the report, which it said represented findings of a federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspection that included a worksite exposure assessment, coworker and next-of-kin interviews, medical record reviews, and collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\nThe report does not name the worker or the Massachusetts facility. However, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration reported in filings last year that an employee at the Holyoke location of cannabis company Trulieve who was packaging ground cannabis into pre-rolls suffered an asthma attack and later died in the hospital. Trulieve identified the worker as Lorna McMurrey, 27, last year.\nRepresentatives for Trulieve did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\nThe report cites studies that identify respiratory hazards in the cannabis cultivation and production industry, such as microbial and plant allergens. The report also states that chemicals such as pesticides and allergens specific to the cannabis plant itself can be a hazard.\nThe finding comes as legalization of recreational marijuana, and the resultant growth of the cannabis industry, is spreading. Almost half the states allow adult recreational use of marijuana. Legalizations began in 2012 with Washington and Colorado and have only accelerated.\nAdvocates for safety in the marijuana industry have called for more safeguards to make sure the cannabis business doesn\u2019t put workers or the public at risk.\nThe death of the Massachusetts worker \u201cshould be a big red flag to lawmakers that we need to put way more guardrails around that industry,\u201d said Scott Gagnon, a cannabis industry watchdog who advocates for the prevention of substance abuse in Maine, where marijuana has been legal for several years.\nThe industry wants to be as safe as possible, said Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, the marijuana law reform group, adding that \u201clikelihood of such incidences is greatly reduced in environments where cannabis businesses are licensed, regulated, and required to adhere to the same sort of workplace safety regulations and standards as others.\"\n\u201cFurthermore, when such incidences do occur, the regulated marketplace ensures that they are properly investigated and that corrective actions are taken to prevent future incidents,\u201d Armentano said.",

The U.S. will also work to expand its contributions to the bank, one of the officials said.\nThe new IDB financing platform is part of a package that will also include funds from the private sector and other donors \"to reinforce this welcoming spirit in the region,\" the senior official said. The hope is to expand economic prospects in the region so migrants do not head to the U.S.\n\"We are talking about building competitive regional supply chains that can compete in the market, and that means competing against China,\" one senior U.S. official said, adding that better economies at home could reduce migration outflows.\nClean energy, semiconductors and medical supplies were areas where the region could compete globally, a second official said, adding that increased cooperation efforts could also help Latin America bolster work in space, an area where it has lagged.\nPartner countries could also advance the use of innovative new instruments such as Colombia's green bonds, or the recent debt for climate swap set up for Ecuador by the U.S. International Development Finance Corp, the official said.\nBiden, a Democrat, has grappled with record numbers of migrants crossing the southwest border, fueling criticism from Republicans and some Democratic mayors who say their cities are struggling to provide housing and food.\nMayors of Chicago, Denver, Houston, New York and Los Angeles this week wrote to Biden seeking a meeting and more federal funding, faster access to work permits for migrants and improved coordination, according to a copy reviewed by Reuters.\nBiden has sought to pair restrictive measures to deter illegal border crossings with new legal avenues to the U.S.\nIn mid-October, the administration resumed direct deportations to Venezuela that were stalled for years due to tensions between the two nations. At the same time, the U.S. admitted three Venezuelan families as refugees through a new migrant processing office in Colombia, the senior official said.\nBecause the families arrived through the U.S. refugee resettlement program, they will have a path to U.S. citizenship and receive other benefits not available for those crossing the border illegally, the official said.\nThe administration aims to scale up processing through Safe Mobility Offices, centers that have also opened in Guatemala, Costa Rica and Ecuador. It remained unclear whether those measures and others will reduce record migration levels.\nThe Biden administration has called on the U.S. Congress to provide additional funds for border security, including money to pay other countries to deport migrants. Panama has expressed interest in expanding migrant screening and deportations if funds become available, the official said.

        "text": "\nBy Lisa Baertlein and Priyamvada C\n(Reuters) -United Parcel Service cut its 2023 revenue forecast for the second straight quarter on Thursday as delivery demand continued to soften ahead of the key holiday season, and its shares sank 5% to the lowest level in about three years.\nThe world's biggest package delivery firm is caught in a profit squeeze as it also battles to win back business lost during the summer's tumultuous U.S. labor talks, and to offset higher costs from the resulting five-year deal covering 340,000 Teamsters-represented workers in the United States.\n\"We expected conditions in the third quarter to be challenging, and they were,\" CEO Carol Tome said on a conference call.\nThe year-end holiday season is the busiest period for package delivery companies. UPS customers include retailers like Amazon.com, Walmart and Macy's, which are bracing for U.S. holiday sales that some analysts forecast could be the slowest since 2018.\nRetail reported the biggest package volume decline in the third quarter, when all industry sectors retreated, UPS executives said.\nUPS now expects U.S. package volume to be down in the low- to mid-single-digit percentages by December. It previously forecast flatish year-over-year volume by year end.\n\"It's weak, there's no way around it,\" said Jefferies analyst Stephanie Moore, who attributed the company's tempered outlook to market forces rather than unique UPS challenges.\nShares of rival FedEx also fell, declining 4% in midday trading.\nUPS, seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy, cut its full-year revenue forecast to $91.3 billion to $92.3 billion, down from its prior forecast of around $93 billion.\nThe company also reduced its projection for annual adjusted operating margin to between 10.8% and 11.3% versus 11.8% previously.\nSome of the margin pressure comes from customers shifting to less lucrative ground-based delivery from faster and more profitable air-based services. E-commerce leader Amazon.com, the biggest UPS customer, is leading that trend, executives said.\nThe entire package delivery industry is fighting for market share as the pool of potential e-commerce deliveries shrinks. Reuters reported earlier this month that UPS and its rivals for the first time in years have been using discounts and other incentives to maintain and win market share, moves that could further pressure sector profits.\nUPS said labor negotiations-related package diversions continued into the third quarter. It revised the total to 1.5 million average daily packages, up from 1.2 million previously.\nThus far, it has recouped 600,000 of those packages, with Amazon accounting for half of that regained business, executives said.\nMeanwhile, UPS is investing with an eye on future growth.\nThe Atlanta-based company this quarter will spend more than $1 billion on healthcare specialist MNX Global Logistics and returns specialist Happy Returns to bolster package volumes, CEO Tome said.\nUPS also has been cutting jobs, parking planes and leaning on package tracking and other technology to help offset falling e-commerce demand, weak export and industrial production and the cost hit from its new labor contract.\nThe company posted an adjusted profit of $1.57 per share in the quarter, topping analysts estimates by 5 cents, according to LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Priyamvada C and Lisa Baertlein; Editing by Arun Koyyur, David Holmes and Bill Berkrot)",

        "text": "\nIf you\u2019re looking to give a gift that keeps on giving this holiday season, you might want to consider stocks or other investments. Your loved one likely won't be disappointed.\nA new Yahoo Finance/Ipsos poll revealed that almost 7 in 10 Americans would be pleased with an investment as a holiday gift. Just 6% said they would be let down by receiving this type of gift.\nStill, an investment as a gift requires careful planning to avoid any tax missteps and ensure that the gift provides the benefits the recipient needs.\n\"When an individual receives securities as a gift, the potential growth is hopeful. It might be something more in the future,\" Erika Safran, founder of Safran Wealth Advisors, told Yahoo Finance. \"Perhaps if an individual comes from a family or low income earners, chances are that that monetary gift will be put to use, pay a bill, pay off a debt, pay for tuition\u2026.But for someone who may not need the money, receiving the securities creates a greater future opportunity.\"\nHere's what to know.\nRead more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide\nSafran recommended that gift givers start by determining what investments best suited their intended recipients.\nInvestments like mutual funds and ETFs are less risky because they are diversified, she said, while stocks come with more risk. Some can be big winners; others, not so much.\n\"One downside,\" she said, \"you may be giving that appreciated security, which, in turn, may turn out to be a dog.\"\nGift givers should be mindful of the gift recipient's investment experience and financial education, Safran said. Those giving a gift should also explain their stock pick to their recipient.\n\"Tell the story: why you bought it, why you own it, what it's done, and how it's invested,\" she said. \"And is this something that you feel comfortable holding on to.\"\nAnother consideration, according to Nicholas Weisert, a financial adviser and chief compliance officer at Integra Financial, is the recipient's tax bracket.\n\"So folks in higher tax brackets, you're likely going to want to skew towards investments that have lower tax ramifications \u2014 your stocks and growth funds, ETFs or mutual funds,\" he said. \"And folks in lower tax brackets, you'd probably prefer them to receive the things that are interest bearing or paying a dividend.\"\nTaxes can make buying an investment gift a little more complicated than purchasing a gift card.\nThe first thing to know is that the maximum amount a gift giver can give another person \u2014 aside from a spouse \u2014 in the 2023 calendar year without reporting it to the IRS is $17,000. Past that point, the gift giver will likely have to fill out tax Form 709 to report the gift.\nThat doesn't mean the gift is taxed, though, experts are quick to point out.\n\"Many confuse the annual gift tax limit of $17,000 as a maximum gift and believe amounts above that are taxable,\" Safran said. \"Though the annual gift tax exclusion is $17,000 per giver to one recipient, it does not mean that amounts above that are taxed. All it means is that this is the maximum amount you can give to one person without filing a tax form to inform the IRS.\"\nGifts above $17,000 also count against the gift giver's lifetime gift exemption. For 2023, gift givers can give a maximum lifetime amount of $12.92 million in cash or other assets to one person before the federal gift tax comes into play. So, that's a lot of wiggle room.\nAnother tax consideration is the cost basis of the investment, Safran said.\nIn a hypothetical, she explained that if the original investment was $10,000 and is now worth $50,000, the gift recipient now owns $50,000 in stock. That gifted stock is also treated as if the recipient bought the stock on the same date as the original owner. So, if the recipient sells the stock immediately, they will need to pay capital gains tax on the $40,000 gain.\nBut whether it is taxed as a long-term or short-term gain depends on when the original owner purchased the stock. If the original owner held it for more than one year, the recipient will pay long-term capital gains tax. But if the owner held the security for less than a year, the gains are taxed as ordinary income. In general, long-term capital gain taxes are lower than ordinary income, so the gift recipient should hold the investment gift longer.\nThe gift giver may also want to think about the best tax situation for them. Selling a stock first and giving the cash instead to the recipient may make more sense if the value of the stock has gone down since it was originally purchased. That's because the gift giver can realize a capital loss that can be used to offset any other capital gains that tax year. If the giver has no gains to offset, they can use the loss to deduct against ordinary income, up to $3,000 per tax year.\nOnce investors have selected the right investment for the recipient and know the tax implications, the most straightforward way to transfer the asset from the owner\u2019s account to the gift recipient is via a brokerage firm. Typically, the owner of the securities signs a document by hand or using DocuSign to transfer the assets.\n\"That's the easiest way of doing it. There are other more complicated ways,\" Safran said. \"You can also transfer it to someone who owns an account at another brokerage firm. But it's a different process. So maybe the bulk of it is yes, you can transfer securities to any brokerage firm. The easiest is though is if the recipient already has an account.\"\nDylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.\nClick here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and more\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "text": "\nBy Leika Kihara\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese authorities are facing renewed pressure to combat a sustained depreciation in the yen, as investors eye prospects of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates while the Bank of Japan remains wedded to its super low interest rate policy.\nThe Japanese yen hit a fresh one-year low of 150.50 per dollar, and was not far off the three-decade low of 151.94 it touched in October last year that led to Japanese authorities intervening in the currency market.\nBelow are details on how yen-buying intervention works:\nLAST CONFIRMED YEN-BUYING INTERVENTION?\nJapan bought yen in September of last year, its first foray in the market to boost its currency since 1998, after a Bank of Japan (BOJ) decision to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy drove the yen as low as 145 per dollar. It intervened again in October 2022 after the yen plunged to a 32-year low of 151.94.\nThe yen's jump on Oct. 3 led some traders to believe Japan intervened again, although funds flow data suggest otherwise. The Ministry of Finance will release monthly intervention data on Oct. 31 that will confirm whether authorities had stepped in.\nWHY STEP IN?\nYen-buying intervention is rare. Far more often the Ministry of Finance has sold yen to prevent its rise from hurting the export-reliant economy by making Japanese goods less competitive overseas.\nBut yen weakness is now seen as problematic, with Japanese firms having shifted production overseas and the economy heavily reliant on imports for goods ranging from fuel and raw materials to machinery parts.\nWHAT HAPPENS FIRST?\nWhen Japanese authorities escalate their verbal warnings to say they \"stand ready to act decisively\" against speculative moves, that is a sign intervention may be imminent.\nRate checking by the BOJ - when central bank officials call dealers and ask for buying or selling rates for the yen - is seen by traders as a possible precursor to intervention.\nSo far, Japanese policymakers have said only that currency rates ought to move stably reflecting fundamentals, and that excess volatility was undesirable.\nSTEALTH INTERVENTION\nSince October last year, Japanese authorities have refrained from confirming whether they had stepped into the market. They may be relying on psychological tactics to fight yen bears.\nBy staying mum, authorities can keep investors guessing and discourage speculators from testing the yen's new lows - a tactic known as \"stealth intervention.\"\nLINE IN THE SAND?\nAuthorities say they look at the speed of yen falls, rather than levels, and whether the moves are driven by speculators, to determine whether to step into the currency market.\nWith the dollar having breached the psychologically important 150-yen level, many market players see 151.94 yen, where Japan last intervened, as the next threshold, then 155.\nWHAT'S THE TRIGGER?\nThe decision is highly political. When public anger over the weak yen and a subsequent rise in the cost of living is high, that puts pressure on the administration to respond. This was the case when Tokyo intervened last year.\nWith his approval ratings sliding, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced a plan to compile a package of steps to cushion the economic blow from rising inflation.\nIf the yen's slide accelerates and draws the ire of media and public, the chance of intervention would rise again.\nThe decision would not be easy. Intervention is costly and could easily fail, given that even a large burst of yen buying would pale next to the $7.5 trillion that change hands daily in the foreign exchange market.\nHOW WOULD IT WORK?\nWhen Japan intervenes to stem yen rises, the Ministry of Finance issues short-term bills, raising yen it then sells to weaken the Japanese currency.\nTo support the yen, however, the authorities must tap Japan's foreign reserves for dollars to sell for yen.\nIn either case, the finance minister issues the order to intervene, and the BOJ executes the order as the ministry's agent.\nCHALLENGES?\nYen-buying intervention is more difficult than yen-selling.\nWhile Japan holds nearly $1.3 trillion in foreign reserves, these could be substantially eroded if Tokyo intervened heavily and repeatedly, leaving authorities constrained over how long they can defend the yen.\nJapanese authorities also consider it important to seek the support of Group of Seven partners, notably the United States if the intervention involves the dollar.\nWashington gave tacit approval when Japan intervened last year, reflecting recent close bilateral relations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month the question of Washington giving the greenlight over another yen-buying intervention by Japan \"depends on the details\" of the situation.\nSpeaking after a G20 finance leaders' meeting in Marrakech earlier this month, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said he told his G20 counterparts that Tokyo may need to take \"appropriate action\" in the exchange-rate market as global monetary tightening could heighten currency volatility.\n(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Lincoln Feast)",

We know from listening to our employees that they are looking for a pay increase to combat inflation, among other concerns,\u201d MGM Resorts CEO Bill Hornbuckle told investors in an earnings call at the same time negotiations were taking place in a casino ballroom. \u201cThis deal, when announced, will do just that.\"\nThe Culinary Workers Union had threatened to begin a strike in the pre-dawn hours Friday if negotiations failed.\nBut the union's tentative agreement with Caesars appeared to be providing the momentum needed for the union to win new contracts for all 35,000 of its members who have been working under expired contracts at 18 hotel-casinos.\n\u201cAs soon as one company reaches a deal, the others just fall right in line,\u201d said Bill Werner, an associate professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose research includes hospitality law and labor relations. But, he said, \u201cI would say this is as close as we\u2019ve come in a long time to an actual strike.\u201d\nThe breakthrough pact with Caesars came after 20 straight hours of bargaining that began Tuesday and stretched into Wednesday morning, the union said.\nCaesars said in a statement that the agreement \u201crecognizes the integral contributions our Team Members have made to the success we have seen in Las Vegas over the last few years\u201d with meaningful wage increases and opportunities for growth tied to plans to bring more union jobs to the Strip.\nThe contract, which is pending approval by the union's rank and file, would cover properties including the company's flagship Caesars Palace and Flamingo, Harrah\u2019s, Horseshoe, Paris Las Vegas, Planet Hollywood, Cromwell and Linq.\nOutside Caesars Palace on Wednesday, Joshua Guray told The Associated Press he came in on a morning flight from Los Angeles and planned to be in Las Vegas for less than 24 hours.\nThe only item on his itinerary? A dinner reservation with a friend at one of his favorite restaurants \u2014 Bacchanal, the luxury buffet at Caesars Palace.\nGuray said he didn't know that tens of thousands of hotel workers were in the middle of contract negotiations before he planned his trip. But he said if a tentative contract hadn't been reached and a strike coincided with his travel plans, he would have ditched his dinner reservations.\n\u201cI try to stand in solidarity with other workers,\u201d he said. \u201cLife can be hard out there so I understand what they're fighting for.\u201d\nBethany Khan, the union's spokesperson, said terms of its deal with Caesars would be made public once approved. A vote is expected to take place in the coming days.\nA sweeping walkout could still happen if the union cannot make deals with MGM Resorts, the state\u2019s largest private employer, and Wynn Resorts by 5 a.m. Friday. Negotiations with Wynn Resorts are scheduled for Thursday.\nA strike by workers at the two remaining companies would cut to the heart of the city's economic backbone and significantly disrupt operations at some of the most recognizable Las Vegas hotel-casinos as they prepare to host hundreds of thousands of people for next week's Formula 1 debut on the Strip.\nIt would also be the latest in a series of high-profile actions nationwide in what has been a big year for labor unions. That includes walkouts in Hollywood, UPS\u2019 contentious negotiations that threatened to disrupt the nation\u2019s supply chain, and the ongoing hotel workers strike at Detroit\u2019s three casinos, including MGM Grand Detroit.\nThe inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix course will feature sweeping views of many of the casinos at risk of walkouts: Aria, Bellagio, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, New York-New York, Park MGM and Wynn and Encore resorts.\nThe hospitality workers say they will strike for as long as it takes to get fair contracts \u2014 from the housekeepers and utility porters who work behind the scenes to keep the Strip\u2019s mega-resorts humming, to the bartenders and cocktail servers who provide the customer service that has helped make Las Vegas famous.\nTiffany Thomas, a guest room attendant at Mandalay Bay, said she is fighting for her family and future hospitality workers.\n\u201cI am willing to go on strike because I have a 10-year-old daughter who comes to negotiations with me, and she is going to inherit all of this,\" Thomas said. \u201cI refuse to sit back and watch what we\u2019ve built crumble. I want my daughter to look at me and know I fought for a better future.\u201d\nBargaining has been underway since April over pay, benefits, job security and working conditions, but negotiations ramped up in recent months after an overwhelming majority of union members voted in September to authorize a strike.\nThe vote was followed by large-scale rallies, including one last month that ended with the arrests of 58 workers who sat in the street and halted rush-hour traffic on one of the most recognizable stretches of the Strip. The workers called it a show of force ahead of any potential strike.\nMembers currently receive health insurance and earn about $26 hourly, including benefits, Khan said. The union hasn't revealed what it has been seeking in pay raises because, Khan said, \u201cwe do not negotiate in public,\u201d but the union has said it is negotiating the largest wage increases in its history.\nThe workers have also said they want better job security amid advancements in technology, as well as stronger security protections, including more safety buttons on casino floors.",

        "text": "\nInvestors pushed bank stocks higher last week, riding a stock market rally fueled by hopes that the Federal Reserve might be done raising interest rates and that a \"soft landing\" in the US economy was now possible.\nLast Tuesday, after inflation data showed pricing pressure cooling quicker than expected, two major indexes that track the banking industry had their biggest single-day jumps since May 2020.\nThese same indexes \u2013 KBW Nasdaq US bank index (^BKX) and the KBW Nasdaq US regional bank index (^KRX) \u2013 are also on pace to show their best monthly returns in nearly three years. Both have surged roughly 13% since the beginning of November.\nBut analysts are not yet ready to declare that the worst is over for the industry, cautioning that many banks still face a litany of pressures that are expected to last well into 2024.\nRegional banks are certainly on more stable ground than they were during the first half of the year, when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic triggered panic about the strength of many other mid-sized banks across the US.\nYet their ability to earn more robust profits remains a challenge due to elevated interest rates and bond yields that mean more expensive deposits, higher paper losses on bonds held for investment and difficulties for borrowers.\nNew capital requirements proposed by US regulators threaten to make it even more difficult for some of these mid-sized banks to thrive in the future. Those rules, set to go into effect starting in 2025, are currently the subject of fierce debate in Washington.\nRegional bank stocks have notably lagged the S&P 500 this year, even as they\u2019ve recovered from the drubbing they took last spring. In fact, the KBW Nasdaq US bank index and the KBW Nasdaq US regional bank index are still trading at near-record low levels compared to the performance of the S&P 500.\nThe bull case for banks is that peak interest rates are now in the past and that a recession does not develop in 2024. If the Fed begins cutting rates next year, as many on Wall Street are now projecting, that could lower the industry\u2019s deposit costs and thus improve profitability.\nCurrently, the Fed funds rate sits in a target range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest since 2001, following the most aggressive series of hikes since the 1980s.\nSome bank bulls point to what happened in 1995, the year following another series of interest rate hikes by the Fed. Once it was clear those hikes were over and the Fed cut rates twice, bank stocks surged by 54% on average that year and at least 37% for the two years following.\nBut bulls have had their hopes dashed before. Bank stocks also surged in July, once it became clear that deposit outflows at certain regional lenders had stabilized, only to retreat again in September as long-term bond yields surged and fears mounted that the Fed planned to hold rates higher for longer.\n\"It's nice to see this rally,\" said bank analyst Chris Whalen, but \"we're gonna go right back the other way\" when the US Treasury auctions off long-term debt and bond yields rise again.\nIt is also still possible that financial conditions could tighten significantly, as the Fed's \"higher for longer\" interest rate campaign is expected to slow business activity. And if inflation reaccelerates and the Fed is forced to keep raising rates, bank stocks could certainly be in for more trouble.\nThe vast majority of long-term investors remain underweight banks and they aren\u2019t interested in increasing exposures, said RBC banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.\nThey are \"taking a wait and see attitude and I think they're going to need to see further evidence that a soft landing is going to show up for them to jump in with both feet,\" Cassidy said. A \"pivotal moment\" will come when the Fed communicates fully that it is done raising rates, he added.\n\"Once [the Fed] indicates they are done, the next move on rates will be down. If they don't cut rates dramatically that will be a signal to investors that the economy is going to get a boost.\"\nDavid Kostin, chief US equity strategist for Goldman Sachs, highlighted commercial real estate as a known risk heading into next year.\nThat \"will likely imperil several regional banks holding mortgages where the collateral value is below the loan amount,\" Kostin wrote in a 2024 outlook published last week.\nThe Fed, in a bank \"supervision and regulation\" report released earlier this month, highlighted exposure to commercial real estate deterioration as among the top issues being monitored by bank examiners, along with the impact of rising interest rates on bank capital and earnings.\nSome in the industry are still concerned about the amount of unrealized bond losses sitting on bank balance sheets.\nMost banks will continue to shoulder those \"deadweight\" assets, according to Jeff Davis, managing director at Mercer Capital.\n\"It's a drag on profitability,\" he said.\nUnrealized losses on held-to-maturity bonds rose on average by 2.49% in the third quarter as compared to the second, according to SNL data analyzed by Mercer Capital, with mid-sized to regional lenders seeing higher average losses.\nThese paper losses are forcing many banks to cut back on lending, limit dividends and sell off assets.\n\"It's really taken away most banks\u2019 ability to go on offense,\" Alexander Yokum, a regional bank analyst with CFRA, told Yahoo Finance.\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "text": "\nBy David Shepardson and Joseph White\n(Reuters) - General Motors and the United Auto Workers (UAW) struck a tentative deal on Monday, ending the union's unprecedented six-week campaign of coordinated strikes that won record pay increases for workers at the Detroit Three automakers.\nThe accord follows deals the union reached in recent days with Ford Motor and Chrysler-owner Stellantis - significant victories for auto workers after years of stagnant wages and painful concessions following the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"We wholeheartedly believe our strike squeezed every last dime out of General Motors,\" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a video address. \"They underestimated us. They underestimated you.\"\nThe union officially suspended its strike against the Detroit Three. UAW local leaders will come to Detroit on Friday to consider the deal with GM, before taking terms to all union workers for ratification.\n\"We are looking forward to having everyone back to work across all of our operations,\" said GM CEO Mary Barra.\nThe new contracts will significantly raise costs for the automakers. The companies and some analysts have said the deals will make it harder for the Detroit Three to compete with electric-vehicle leader Tesla and nonunion foreign brands such as Toyota Motor.\nThe UAW won from GM roughly the same package of wage increases agreed with the other two automakers. Pay for veteran workers will rise by 33% and GM will give $2,500 in five payments to retirees through 2028.\nSources have said pension benefits were a sticking point in the UAW's negotiations with GM, which has more retirees than Ford or Stellantis.\nFain said the union's move on Saturday to strike a key GM engine factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, \"landed the knockout blow\" that got the deal.\nThe contract reverses years of efforts by GM to create lower-paid groups of UAW workers at units such as component plants, parts warehouses and electric vehicle battery operations. It puts workers at GM's battery joint-venture with South Korea's LG Energy under the national agreement.\nFain said some workers at GM's component operations will get pay increases of as much as 89%.\nThe contract also restricts use of lower paid temporary workers. \"We have slammed the door on having a permanent underclass of temporary workers at GM,\" Fain said.\nThe UAW also gained more sway over the companies' investment decisions by securing the right to strike over future plant closures.\nAll three companies have said they do not plan to close existing factories as they shift to EVs. Yet the contract could force them to keep unprofitable plants open during a recession or period of slow sales for new models.\nHIGHER COSTS\nA series of walkouts began on Sept. 15, and nearly 50,000 workers out of nearly 150,000 UAW members at the Detroit automakers eventually joined. The strategy of escalating strikes cost the Detroit Three and suppliers billions of dollars.\nUAW leaders called their contract fight part of a larger movement to reverse decades of economic setbacks for working-class Americans. Some analysts agreed.\n\"This is more than an auto industry story; it is a signal to the entire country that unionized workers can demand and get big wage increases,\" said Patrick Anderson of the Anderson Economic Group.\nThe new contract will cost GM $7 billion over 4.5 years in higher labor costs, two sources told Reuters. Ford said last week it would add $850 to $900 per vehicle in labor costs.\n\"Consumers will bear some of the cost burden over time ... automakers will not have an easy time passing along all of the costs ... and will have to seek efficiencies in other ways, or further limit production to more expensive vehicles that can absorb higher labor costs,\" Cox Automotive's chief economist, Jonathan Smoke, said.\nPRAISE FROM BIDEN\nU.S. President Joe Biden and politicians from both parties weighed in to support the UAW as the union's fight gained popularity with voters. Michigan will again be a crucial swing state in the 2024 presidential election, and Fain made support for the union's fight a condition of winning his endorsement. The UAW still has not formally endorsed Biden's re-election.\n\"This historic contract is a testament to the power of unions and collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping our most iconic American companies thrive,\" Biden said in a statement. His aides had worried that a prolonged strike would damage the U.S. economy and the Democratic president's chances of re-election in 2024.\nThe UAW has said it is committed to organizing workforces at other carmakers, making negotiations in 2028 between the union and the \"Big Five or Big Six.\"\nMomentum toward deals accelerated over the past two weeks after UAW workers walked out at three of the most profitable factories in the world. The UAW eventually struck against nine plants.\n\"We have shown the companies, the American public and the whole world that the working class is not done fighting\" Fain said. \"In fact, we're just getting started.\"\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Joseph White in Detroit; Additional reporting by Shivansh Tiwary, Kannaki Deka and Richard Francis in Bengaluru; Writing by Deepa Babington and Sayantani Ghosh; Editing by David Gaffen, Alistair Bell, Peter Henderson, Matthew Lewis and David Gregorio)",

That's up 17% year over year and already surpasses 2022 ticket sales of 121 million.\nThe strong performance coincided with Taylor Swift's Eras tour and Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour. But Rapino said the momentum is not expected to slow down.\nWhen asked on the post-earnings conference call if he's concerned with future year-over-year comparisons given the record-breaking success of Swift's and Beyonc\u00e9's respective tours, the executive doubled down on the strength of the business, coupled with positive consumer trends.\n\"No one tour will ever hurt us year over year. It's about our macro portfolio of artists and tours, and we have a very good [pipeline] for next year,\" he said, adding that \"we're looking at double-digit growth over this year and next year on ticket sales.\"\nThe US economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the third quarter, buoyed by a resilient consumer who spent big money on attending live event concerts and even the \"Barbenheimer\" double feature.\nAccording to a recent estimate from Morgan Stanley, the summer's concerts and blockbuster films added an estimated $8.5 billion to US growth in Q3.\n\"Live entertainment is currently the brightest star in the broader media and entertainment universe,\" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a previous note to clients.\n\"Not surprisingly, we believe talent, especially artists that command huge fan bases, will be able to increasingly extract incremental value out of the ecosystem (largely driven by increasing supply and ticket pricing), while venues, which have several independent revenue streams, accrue the most value,\" the analyst said.\nShe laid out five catalysts that will lead to sustained long-term growth in the industry: continued spending shifts towards services and experiences; healthy pricing power amid increased demand; positive supply and demand trends as social media apps like TikTok boost global awareness and fan growth; the relatively \"disruption-proof\" nature of live events as virtual methods remain incomparable; and the advent of experiential marketing.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\n*\nAGOA programme expires in 2025\n*\nBiden administration calling for improvements\n*\nAfricans fear changes could bog down renewal\n(Recasts with Ambassador Tai's remarks, writes through)\nBy Joe Bavier\nJOHANNESBURG, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The United States is looking for a \"more useful and effective\" trade programme with Africa, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said on Saturday, as talks are underway to update a two decade-old duty free initiative.\nThe African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which grants exports from qualifying countries duty-free access to the U.S. market, is due to expire in September 2025, with talks focused on renewal and possible reform.\nAGOA was reauthorised twice before -- in 2004 and 2015 -- and Tai is in Johannesburg, South Africa, wrapping up three days of talks with African trade ministers over the programme's future and a possible third reauthorisation. \"We would like to see this programme be more than just a symbolic one. We would like for it to be more useful and effective,\" Tai told journalists.\nOver $10 billion worth of African exports entered the United States duty free last year under the programme. However, in many areas AGOA, which was launched in 2000, has failed to live up to its promise.\nDespite longstanding bipartisan support from U.S. lawmakers, who view AGOA as critical to countering the influence of China in Africa, there are divisions in Washington over the need for updates.\nAfrican countries, concerned that too many changes could bog renewal down in Congress, are pushing for an early 10-year extension. They say improvements can be made once the programme is reauthorised.\nBut the Biden administration wants changes as part of a renewal.\n\"I don't quite know how you would enhance it without doing it in the statute,\" Tai said.\nA revised AGOA should aim to improve the programme's utilisation by qualifying countries and take into account the recent creation of the African Continental Free Trade Area, Tai said.\nIt should also ensure countries maintain benefits even as they grow wealthier and include more small business participation.\nUNPAUSING INVESTMENT\nU.S. business associations say there must be certainty over AGOA if Africa is to take advantage of a current global push by companies to reduce their dependence upon Chinese manufacturing.\n\"American businesses want AGOA reauthorised. Regardless of sector, they've made that very clear,\" British Robinson, who heads the U.S. administration's Prosper Africa trade an business initiative, told Reuters.\nWith renewal still up in the air, businesses are already hitting the pause button on new investments, South African Trade Minister Ebrahim Patel said.\n\"An early reauthorisation will unpause those buttons,\" he said.\nA recent push in the U.S. Congress supports the idea of a quick AGOA renewal.\nU.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Gregory W. Meeks, a New York Democrat, and Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, on Friday said they agreed AGOA could be improved.\n\"But we believe the principal consideration must be ensuring a successful and timely reauthorisation,\" they said in a statement.\nPolitical gridlock, however, has complicated efforts to pass even the most critical legislation in recent months, raising fears AGOA could struggle to make it onto the Congressional agenda.\n(Reporting by Joe Bavier; editing by Clelia Oziel)",

The biggest category, e-commerce, is set to reach only $186 billion in 2025, rather than the $211 billion the researchers estimated previously.\nConsumers in the region of more than 650 million people are curbing spending to cope with elevated inflation and interest rates. Meanwhile, competition is intensifying. Global giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as well as regional players Grab Holdings Ltd., Sea Ltd. and GoTo Group are vying for a slice of markets from online retailing to food delivery and ride hailing.\nThe region\u2019s entire internet economy is now on track to reach $295 billion by 2025, according to the report, down from a previous forecast of $330 billion. This is the second time estimates have been revised downward in the companies\u2019 annual study, which covers Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing a major trend in a focus and shift towards profitability,\u201d Sapna Chadha, Southeast Asia vice president at Google, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \u201cWhat we need to see is more of a focus on impact and outcomes.\u201d\nEven as more people in Southeast Asia come online, a bulk of the region\u2019s spending still comes from relatively wealthier consumers in major cities. The top 30% high-value users account for more than 70% of digital economy transaction values, the report said, signaling internet companies are struggling to attract potential customers in more remote regions.\nPrivate funding of companies in Southeast Asia has dropped to its lowest level in six years, slowing sharply from pandemic highs as investors become more choosy and capital becomes more expensive. The number of deals involving tech companies in the region shrank by more than half to 564 in the first half of 2023 from the year-earlier period, according to the report.\nInvestors in the region, many of whom started funds in the middle of the last decade, are facing mounting pressure to deliver returns in a challenging market for public listings. Funds in Southeast Asia started in the past five to seven years have paid out a median 4% of invested capital back to investors, compared with about 50% for China and 40% for the US, according to the study.\n--With assistance from Rishaad Salamat and Haslinda Amin.\n(Updates with comment from executive in fifth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nWho\u2019s Ready for a Trump-Biden Rematch?

        "date": "2023-11-14T09:01:49.000Z",
        "text": "\nBy Natalie Grover and Alex Lawler\nLONDON (Reuters) -The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Tuesday raised its oil demand growth forecasts for this year and next despite slower economic growth in nearly all major economies, although its 2024 outlook remains much lower than that of producer group OPEC.\nThe Paris-based IEA said the market could shift into surplus at the start of 2024 having been kept in a \"significant deficit\" through year-end by voluntary cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia which last until the end of December.\n\"For now, with demand still exceeding available supplies heading into the Northern Hemisphere winter, market balances will remain vulnerable to heightened economic and geopolitical risks \u2013 and further volatility ahead,\" the IEA said in a monthly report.\nOil has weakened to around $82 a barrel for Brent crude from a 2023 high in September near $98. Concern about economic growth and demand has pressured prices, despite support from supply cuts by OPEC and its allies, and conflict in the Middle East.\nThe IEA joins the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in raising its oil demand growth forecast for 2023. Demand in 2023 has been supported by resilient U.S. deliveries and record September demand from China, the IEA said.\nIn 2023, the IEA expects world demand to rise by 2.4 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 2.3 million bpd seen previously and bringing its view closer to that of OPEC, which on Monday nudged up its forecast to 2.46 million bpd.\nSLOWDOWN IN VIEW\nFor 2024, the IEA raised its oil demand growth forecast to 930,000 bpd from 880,000 bpd. Expectations are underpinned by hopes of interest rate cuts and the recent fall in crude prices, the IEA, the energy adviser to industrialised nations, said.\nThis is still well below OPEC's forecast of 2.25 million bpd. The difference - 1.32 million bpd - is equivalent to roughly 1% of daily world oil use and translates into more than the daily production of an OPEC member such as Libya.\nOPEC and the IEA have clashed in recent years over issues such as the long-term oil demand outlook and the need for investment in new supplies.\nThe IEA said the 2024 demand slowdown will arise as \"the last phase of the pandemic economic rebound dissipates and as advancing energy efficiency gains, expanding electric vehicle fleets and structural factors reassert themselves.\"\nThe 2024 outlook will be in focus at the next meeting of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on Nov. 26. The group's existing deal limits supply into 2024, although the extra Saudi and Russian voluntary cuts last until the end of December.\n(Reporting by Natalie Grover and Alex Lawler in London; editing by David Goodman, Jason Neely and David Evans)",

        "text": "\nWall Street stocks continued their rally on Wednesday with investors embracing the idea that abruptly cooling inflation will put interest rate hikes on ice.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led gains, rising about 0.5%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) barely finished above the flat line. The Dow has now risen four straight days and is at its highest levels since Aug. 14.\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrencies also extended their recent rally. The world's largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC-USD), rose more than 6% to above $37,000 per coin.\nIn commodities, oil prices fell with West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) hitting $76.51 per barrel while Brent Crude (BZ=F) fell to just below $81 a barrel.\nThe jump in stocks was juiced by the surprise easing in US price pressures, which spurred bets the Federal Reserve will keep rates steady and could start cutting them early next year. Data out Wednesday reiterated this narrative as October wholesale prices saw the largest monthly decline in two and a half years.\nMeanwhile, October's retail sales report revealed the first monthly decline in sales since March, though the 0.1% drop still topped Wall Street's estimates.\nShares in Target (TGT) surged more than 16% after its third quarter earnings clobbered estimates. The big box retailer pointed to the resilience of the US consumer in the face of higher borrowing costs.\nStocks closed higher on Wednesday, extending Tuesday's rally sparked by cooler-than-expected inflation data that has investors increasingly confident the Federal Reserve is likely done raising interest rates.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led gains, rising about 0.5%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) barely finished above the flat line. The Dow has now risen four straight days and is at its highest levels since Aug. 14.\nWe've been tracking the correlation between Treasury yields and stocks for weeks. There's been a pretty clear pattern: If yields rise, stocks fall.\nRecent work from Julian Emanuel at Evercore ISI shows this correlation in graph form below.\nBut interestingly, that's not playing out in the market today. A day after a massive rally in stocks came and yields collapsed, both bond yields and the major averages are higher on Wednesday.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) is up 9 basis points to 4.53% while the 30-year Treasury yield (^TYX) is up 7 basis points to 4.69%.\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) leads gains, rising about 0.5%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up about 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is clinging to gains of about 0.1%.\nA big meeting is expected on Wednesday night between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US corporate leaders.\nYahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita and Ben Werschkul have the details:\nXi Jinping is having dinner Wednesday night with American CEOs at a time of rising US skepticism about China's tighter business controls and concerns about that country's slowing economy.\nIt was a much different story eight years ago, the last time Xi held court with American executives on US soil.\nIn 2015, American CEOs flocked to see the Chinese president while downplaying concerns about China\u2019s state control of its economy, which was then churning out a 7% GDP growth rate.\nThat trip included a tour of Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) campus and a picture of Xi standing next to several rows of executives lining up to meet him, from Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) then-CEO Jeff Bezos to Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook.\nZuckerberg, who was eager at the time to reverse Facebook\u2019s ban in China, greeted Xi first and spoke in Mandarin, according to reports from that trip. \"Did you feel the room shake?\" Cook was even quoted as saying about Xi's entrance.\nBut this week \u2014 with Facebook still banned in China and Zuckerberg himself recovering from an ACL tear \u2014 the Meta head is steering clear of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is one of several leaders not planning to meet with Xi after years of tenser relations with China.\n\"At that time, in 2015, we were a lot more optimistic,\" said Stanford professor Herbert Lin, adding that there had been a hope then that China would eventually be integrated into a larger global economic system.\nLin said companies were well aware of the risks in previous eras but simply calculated they couldn\u2019t pass up the Chinese market.\nNow, \"that belief is now a lot more shaky.\"\nOngoing geopolitical issues between the US and Chinese governments may only exacerbate the tensions in the coming years as Xi tries to simultaneously staunch the outflow of capital from the country while maintaining rigid political controls. Foreign direct investment in his nation turned negative in new data released this month.\nThe US-China Business Council\u2019s annual member survey released in September found that \"geopolitics is the single largest issue weighing down business sentiment\" alongside concerns about China\u2019s domestic policies.\nTarget (TGT) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday as the retailer surged more than 17% following its earnings release earlier in the day. Target's sales came in roughly in line with Wall Street's expectations but better-than-expected margins and profits helped push the stock higher.\nIntel (INTC) shares were up more than 3% as semiconductors came into focus amid a new chip launch from Microsoft (MSFT). Intel stock was pacing for its highest close since July 2022.\nChinese e-commerce plays Alibaba (BABA) and JD.Com (JD) were both higher after JD.com reported sales higher than analysts had expected. JD.com shares were up more than 8% while Alibaba shares popped 3% on the news. Alibaba is set to release results before the bell on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, TJX (TJX) shares slipped more than 2% despite the company raising its full-year sales guidance.\nSemiconductor stocks are headed lower Wednesday afternoon after Microsoft (MSFT) launched its first custom AI-powered chip.\nNvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) all traded lower on the news. Nvidia had been nearing a record win streak prior to the announcement.\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley has more on Microsoft's chip:\nAt its Ignite conference Wednesday, the company said the chip, called the Maia 100, is the first in its planned Azure Maia AI accelerator series. In addition to the Maia 100, the tech giant also unveiled its first custom Arm-based (ARM) Azure Cobalt central processing unit for general purpose cloud computing.\nWith the two chips, Microsoft is now on par with rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), which have also developed their own custom chips to run their competing cloud platforms. The company says the chip will be used for both cloud-based training and inferencing for AI models. Training is the process through which a company sets up an AI model, and inferencing is when it rolls the model out for use in the wild.\n\u201cSoftware is our core strength, but frankly, we are a systems company,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Rani Borkar, corporate vice president for Azure hardware systems and infrastructure, said in a statement.\nAll three of the major averages were in the green Wednesday afternoon.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led gains, rising about 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) were both higher by about 0.3%.\nFinancials (XLF) have gained nearly 0.8%, leading the 11 sectors, as the second day of the rally in bank stocks continues.\nBelow is a look at how some of the largest bank stocks are performing courtesy of the YFinteractive.\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) jumped as much as 12% on Wednesday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) updated its holdings to reveal it purchased a new stake in the media company.\nAccording to Berkshire's 13F report, which discloses its holdings, the company purchased nearly 9.7 million shares with a market value of about $43.8 million in its September quarter.\nShares of Sirius have struggled so far this year, down about 10% compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 17% gain over that same time period.\nThe update comes as Buffett, often referred to as the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" sold off his holdings in other companies, including General Motors (GM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter and Gamble (PG), Mondelez (MZ), Celanese (CE), UPS (UPS), and Activision Blizzard, which completed its merger with Microsoft in October.\nHe also trimmed his stake in Amazon (AMZN) by about 5% and his stake in Chevron (CVX) by more than 10%.\nIn addition to Sirius, the billionaire also made an investment in the publicly traded holding company that owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball club and the Battery Atlanta.\nHe purchased 223.6 million shares worth nearly $8 million, according to the filing.\nAtlanta Braves Holdings (BATRA), which was spun off from Liberty Media in July, reported third quarter profit of $272 million, up 11% year-over-year amid higher in-game attendance.\nShares were up more than 2% in late morning trading.\nStocks are soaring this year with the S&P 500 up more than 17%.\nThat could weigh on the upside seen in the benchmark average during 2024, according to Goldman Sachs. The firm sees the S&P 500 closing 2024 at 4700, about a 5% rise from current levels and below the average 8% return typically seen in election years.\n\"Our macro forecasts imply a benign outcome for equities, but the current starting point will limit the potential appreciation for the benchmark US equity index in 2024,\" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in the firm's 2024 outlook released on Wednesday.\nGoldman's economics team has been bullish on the economy and still sees just a 15% chance of a recession in 2024. But the equity strategy team feels the 2.1% GDP growth expected for 2024 is already \"reflected\" in stock prices. Goldman nods to improved margins but doesn't see substantial margin expansion, which would typically be good for company profits, coming in 2024. And, largely, it sees the market properly pricing stocks as of now.\nIn fact, Goldman sees the majority of the upside in the S&P 500 concentrated in the back half of the year, in line with its call for Fed rate cuts to come in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\"Resilient economic growth in the beginning of the year will force the market to push back its current pricing that Fed cuts will begin in 2Q, and US election uncertainty will suppress risk appetite,\" Kostin wrote. \"Later in the year, the first Fed cut and resolution of election uncertainty will lift US equity prices.\"\nTarget (TGT) stock is having its best day since 2019 with shares up more than 17% after reporting earnings on Wednesday morning.\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports:\nIt could have been worse, and it's not like Wall Street was expecting much anyway.\nIn a nutshell, that's Target's third quarter earnings on Wednesday morning.\nAfter almost two years of brutal results at the hands of execution missteps, rising retail theft and increasingly cautious consumer sentiments, Target clobbered lowered analyst estimates for sales, margins and earnings.\nOn a call with reporters, Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell pointed to a \"resilient\" consumer managing to endure numerous financial headwinds from student loan repayments to nagging inflation.\nBut the caution on the call \u2014 and in Target's holiday quarter EPS guidance \u2014 was palpable.\n\"In our research, themes like uncertainty, caution and management of budgets are top of mind,\" said Cornell. \"Consumers are still bringing up pressures like higher interest rates, increased credit card debt, and reduced savings rates have left them with less discretionary income, forcing them to make trade offs.\"\nAdded Cornell, \"For example, we see more consumers delaying purchases until the last moment, such as guests who previously bought sweatshirts or denim in August or September, but are now waiting until the weather turns cold.\"\nBelow are the key metrics from Target's report.\nNet sales: -4.3% year over year to $25 billion, vs. estimates for $24.9 billion\nGross profit margin: 27.4% vs. 24.7% a year ago, vs. estimates for 26.6%\nDiluted EPS: +36% year over year to $2.10, vs. estimates for $1.47 (guidance: $1.20 to $1.60)\nComparable sales: -4.9% year over year (last year it rose 2.7%):\nDigital comparable sales: -6%\nStore comparable sales: -4.6%\nInventory fell 14% from the prior year, led by a 19% reduction in the stock of discretionary categories like apparel and home goods.\nThe stock market rally continued on Wednesday as economic data once again showed investors that inflation is cooling while economic growth slows down.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) all rose more than 0.3%.\nMeanwhile, after tumbling on Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) ticked higher Wednesday morning to 4.52%.",

        "text": "\nMeta (META) reported its third quarter earnings on Wednesday, beating on the top and bottom lines. However, an initial wave of optimism was stymied after the company issued conservative Q4 guidance.\nIn the company's earnings call, Meta CFO Susan Li said that geopolitical unrest \u2013 both recently in the Middle East and more broadly \u2013 is leading to a \"softening\" ad market.\n\"It\u2019s hard for us to attribute demand softness directly to any specific geopolitical event,\" Li told analysts. \"Historically, we\u2019ve seen broader demand softness follow other regional conflicts in the past, such as the Ukraine war. So, this is something we\u2019re continuing to monitor. We\u2019ve reflected the latest trends and advertiser reaction that we\u2019ve seen into our Q4 outlook, which again, I think reflects the greater uncertainty and volatility ahead.\"\nThe company's shares initially rose as much as 4% in after-hours trading, but erased those gains in the aftermath of Meta's call and were over 3% lower in Thursday's pre-market.\nMeta's been navigating rough waters, steadying itself as an AI-powered advertising giant and working through its capital-intensive expansion into VR and AR. The Facebook and Instagram parent has been in the process of shoring up two key areas of interest for investors \u2014 its AI efforts and its position in the digital advertising market, which has been in a prolonged slump and is just showing signs of a rebound.\nMeta's Q3 advertising revenue came in at $33.64 billion, compared to the expected $32.94 billion. The company beat on ad impressions estimates, clocking an increase of 31% year over year, versus the expected 29.6%.\nMeta shares have risen more than 130% year to date, massively outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Internet Index, which are up around 9% and 34% this year, respectively.\n\"The stock has done well this year,\" Neuberger Bergman analyst Daniel Flax told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. \"[If they can] drive durable growth and translate that into earnings per share and free cash flow generation, I think the stock can continue to work its way higher.\"\nMeta's near future could be mired in legal risks, as the company is staring down federal and state lawsuits from 42 attorneys general, who are alleging that Facebook and Instagram's features geared toward children are addictive.\n\"We\u2019re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.\nCurrently, Wall Street analysts' recommendations for Meta break down to 60 Buys, seven Holds, and two Sells.\nHere are the key numbers that Meta reported, as compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\nRevenue: $34.15 billion actual, up 23% year-over-year, versus $33.52 billion expected\nEarnings per share: $4.39 actual, up 168% year-over-year, versus $3.60 expected\nFacebook daily active users: 2.09 billion actual, versus 2.07 billion expected\nReality Labs operating loss: $3.74 billion actual, versus $3.94 billion expected\nQ4 revenue outlook: $36.5 billion-$40 billion actual, versus $38.76 billion expected\nZuckerberg's \"Year of Efficiency\" initiatives seem to be paying off, as the company is decreasing its 2023 capital expenditures outlook. It's revising the range to be between $27 billion and $29 billion, a decline from the previously announced $27 billion to $30 billion.\nMeta's Family of Apps business, which also includes WhatsApp, raked in over $33 billion in revenue. The division's operating income was $17.49 billion for the quarter, handily beating analysts' expectation of $15.23 billion.\nBut Reality Labs, the company's mixed reality business, has been a subject of controversy. Since 2022, Meta has lost more than $20 billion running Reality Labs; $13.7 billion of that came from last year.\nThe company said it expects these losses to continue, and will increase notably year over year in 2023. Meta recently launched its Quest 3 headset, priced at $499.99.\n\"We had a good quarter for our community and business,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. \"I'm proud of the work our teams have done to advance AI and mixed reality with the launch of Quest 3, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and our AI studio.\"\nAllie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2023-11-03T09:03:15.000Z",
        "text": "\nBy Julia Payne\nANTWERP, Belgium (Reuters) - Only a few weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Antwerp-based diamond dealer Thierry Tugendhaft started receiving calls from big jewellers in Paris asking him to stop supplying them with Russian stones.\nHe was not the only one. Other diamond firms in Antwerp, the world's biggest centre of trade in rough diamonds and cutting of the biggest gems, were asked to avoid Russian stones. No easy task when Russia supplies about one third of global demand.\nNow, Western powers want to make the boycott official with a formal ban on Russian stones. A G7 announcement has been expected for some weeks but disagreement over the details is holding things up, a source with knowledge of the matter said.\nMajor Western jewellers, from Tiffany's to Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels have all been keen to distance themselves from Russia's lucrative diamond trade.\nImports of Russian rough diamonds are now at less than 5% of pre-war levels, the source said.\nTugendhaft, the head of T. Diamonds BVBA, said about 50% of his rough diamonds used to come from Russia due to their high quality. His buyers gave him just six weeks to find alternative supplies.\n\"The transition was quite fast because we were already in discussions with Canada, while we were still buying from Russia,\" Tugendhaft said from his office in the Antwerp diamond club. His company now sources about 80% of its diamonds from Canada and the remainder from African countries including Lesotho, South Africa and Botswana.\nOther Antwerp dealers were less nimble, Tugendhaft said, and had to suspend their rough stone trade because European banks would not finance their Russian supplies. Some 90% of the world's diamonds are now cut in India.\nEven though diamonds generate only a fraction of the revenue from oil and gas, they still bring the Kremlin more than $4 billion a year through state-owned Alrosa, the world's biggest producer of rough stones.\nWith Russian oil and gas already under sanctions to diminish the Kremlin's ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine, the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Union now want to curb Moscow's diamond revenues as well.\nBelgium seems to be one step ahead. The port city of Antwerp has been a diamond hub since the 15th century and even though gem cutting is now mostly outsourced to India, the city still dominates the trade of rough and large stones.\nTRACEABILITY\nThe U.S., Canada, Japan and the EU are weighing different proposals to ban Russian stones from their markets, submitted by Belgium, India, France and the World Diamond Council. Belgium was asked by the EU to draft a proposal and it hopes to retain Antwerp as the main hub for rough trade.\nThe main problem in banning Russian diamonds from Western markets, which account for 70% of global diamond jewellery demand, is how to trace the origin of the stones.\nTugendhaft, who has been in the diamond business for 30 years, said traceability was already quite advanced at his firm, which uses a helium scanner to produce three dimensional images at every stage of diamond processing which are then put in a blockchain ledger along with dates and invoices for every movement in the manufacturing process.\nIt costs a few percent of his revenue and he said not only would a full Western ban on Russian gems be costly for the industry, it could take another year to implement fully. Antwerp is the only location that can handle the rough volume and customs and shipment costs would add up, he said.\nThe biggest diamond miner by value, De Beers', uses a blockchain called Tracr. Other systems exist, but the technology's use is not widespread across the industry.\n\"The real problem is the really small stones. They come in parcels of 20,000-40,000 stones. How do you take every stone and put it in a blockchain? It's just not realistic,\" he said.\nMost proposals under consideration by the G7 now focus on rough diamonds of 1 carat and above initially.\nOnce a diamond is cut, reliably tracing its origins becomes nearly impossible without details of the rough stone to match, industry sources say, which puts the onus on the initial sorting stage of the rough stones in Antwerp.\nNew technology may in time be able to determine the stone's origin by comparing it to the unique geology of the mines, but that technology is still under development.\n(Reporting by Julia Payne;Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",

        "text": "\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 About 2 in 3 Americans say their household expenses have risen over the last year, but only about 1 in 4 say their income has increased in the same period, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nAs household expenses outpace earnings, many are expressing concern about their financial futures. What\u2019s more, for most Americans, household debt has either risen in the last year or has not gone away.\nSteve Shapiro, 61, who works as an audio engineer in Pittsburgh, said he\u2019d been spending about $100 a week on groceries prior to this past year, but that he\u2019s now shelling out closer to $200.\n\u201cMy income has stayed the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy is good on paper, but I\u2019m not doing great.\u201d\nAbout 8 in 10 Americans say their overall household debt is higher or about the same as it was a year ago. About half say they currently have credit card debt, 4 in 10 are dealing with auto loans, and about 1 in 4 have medical debt. Just 15% say their household savings have increased over the last year.\nTracy Gonzales, 36, who works as a sub-contractor in construction in San Antonio, Texas, has several thousand dollars of medical debt from an emergency room visit for what she thought was a bad headache but turned out to be a tooth infection.\n\u201cThey'll treat you, but the bills are crazy,\u201d she said. Gonzales said she's tried to avoid seeking medical treatment because of the costs.\nRelatively few Americans say they\u2019re very or extremely confident that they could pay an unexpected medical expense (26%) or have enough money for retirement (18%). Only about one-third are extremely or very confident their current financial situation will allow them to keep up with expenses, though an additional 42% say they\u2019re somewhat confident.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to retirement my entire life. Recently I realized it\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d said Shapiro, of Pittsburgh, adding that his wife\u2019s $30,000 or so of student debt is a financial factor for his household. The couple had hoped to sell their house and move this past year, but decided instead to hold on to their mortgage rate of 3.4%, rather than facing a higher rate. ( The current average long-term mortgage rate reached 7.79% this month. )\nAbout 3 in 10 Americans say they've foregone a major purchase because of higher interest rates in the last year. Nearly 1 in 4 U.S. adults have student debt, with the pandemic-era payment pause on federal loans ending this month, contributing to the crunch.\nWill Clouse, 77, of Westlake, Ohio, said inflation is his biggest concern, as he lives on a fixed income in his retirement.\n\u201cA box of movie candy \u2014 Sno-Caps \u2014 that used to cost 99 cents is now a dollar fifty at the grocery store,\" he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a 50% increase in price. Somebody\u2019s taking advantage of somebody.\"\nYet even as Americans have expressed gloomy sentiments about the economy, many have continued spending, which drove a strong quarter of growth from July though September, when the economy expanded at an annual pace of 4.9%.\nEven so, wages and salaries have largely trailed inflation since the pandemic, leaving most households worse off, though economists debate which measures are the best to use. In the past 12 months, however, average hourly pay has started to pull ahead of prices, rising 0.5% faster.\nAmericans are generally split on whether the Republicans (29%) or the Democrats (25%) are better suited to handle the issue of inflation in the U.S. Three in 10 say they trust neither party to address it.\nGeri Putnam, 85, of Thomson, Georgia, said she's been following the ongoing auto workers strikes with sympathy for the workers' asks.\n\u201cI don't think it's out of line, what they're asking for, when you see what CEOs are making,\u201d she said. \"I think things have gotten out of control. When you can walk into a store and see the next day, across the board, a dollar increase \u2014 that\u2019s a little strange. I understand supply and demand, the cost of shipping, et cetera. But it seems to me everyone\u2019s looking at their bottom lines.\u201d\nPutnam also said she sees her six children struggling financially more than her generation did.\n\u201cThey all have jobs and have never been without them,\" she said. \"They\u2019re achievers, but I think at least two or three of them will never be able to buy a home.\u201d\nA slight majority of all Americans polled (54%) describe their household\u2019s financial situation as good, which is about the same as it\u2019s been for the last year but down from 63% in March of 2022. Older Americans are much more confident in their current finances than younger Americans. Just 39% of 18- to 29-year-olds describe their household finances as good, compared to a majority (58%) of those who are 30 and older. People with higher levels of education or higher household incomes are more likely than Americans overall to evaluate their finances as solid.\nAbout three-quarters of Americans describe the nation\u2019s economy as poor, which is in line with measurements from early last year.\nAmong those who are retired, 3 in 10 say they are highly confident that there\u2019s enough saved for their retirement, about 4 in 10 are somewhat confident, and 31% are not very confident or not confident at all.\nClouse, of Ohio, said the majority of his money had gone towards caring for his wife for the past several years, as she'd been ill. When she passed away this past year, his household lost her Social Security and pension contributions. He sees the political turmoil between Republicans and Democrats as harming the economy, but remains most frustrated by higher prices at the supermarket.\n\u201cGrocery products going up by 20, 30, 40%. There\u2019s no call for that, other than the grocery market people making more money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re ripping off the consumer. I wish Mr. Biden would do something about that.\u201d\nAbout 4 in 10 Americans (38%) approve of how Biden is handling the presidency, while 61% disapprove. His overall approval numbers have remained at a steady low for the last several years. Most Americans generally disapprove of how he\u2019s handling the federal budget (68% disapprove), the economy (67%), and student debt (58%).\n___\nThe poll of 1,163 adults was conducted Oct. 5-9, 2023, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, designed to represent the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",

A recent report from Macquarie said the consortium bid should be closer to A$10 per share.\n\"We were a no at the previous price and now we're reviewing it,\" said Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments and capital markets at VanEck, which owns a 0.3% stake. \"There's still some debate in the market and a lot of the brokers were calling it at over A$10 and at some point you need to consider what other people are saying.\"\nBrookfield Asia Pacific CEO Stewart Upson said the consortium planned to invest $A20 billion to A$30 billion in Origin in the next decade to fund the company's energy transition to achieve net zero emissions.\n\"With its current funding sources and as a public company, Origin will not to be able to match the level of investment at the scale and speed as it could achieve under Brookfield\u2019s ownership,\" he said.\nShould the deal close, Brookfield and its partners GIC and Temasek will own Origin's Energy Markets business, which includes power generation and retailing. MidOcean, in which Saudi Arabia's Aramco recently bought a stake, would take over the integrated gas business, including the 27.5% stake in the Australia Pacific LNG project.

However, industrial output grew 4.6% in October, compared with the same period a year earlier, buoyed by strong autos and restaurant sales.\nGoldman Sachs wrote in a note that \"the divergence in profits across various sectors and firms remained significant\".\nProfits at furniture firms fell 11.8% over the first 10 months of 2023 year-on-year, for example, while electronics manufacturers saw profits jump 20.8% over the same period.\n\"Early signs of a comeback in the global electronics cycle will work in Chinese manufacturers' favour,\" said the EIU's Xu, who warned of downside across the sector and overcapacity across electric vehicles, lithium batteries and solar cells in 2024.\nLONGi Green Energy Technology Co, a major domestic solar energy manufacturer, saw its third quarter net profit plummet 44.1% to 2.5 billion yuan ($346.7 million), hit by macroeconomic headwinds and a supply glut.\nOn Monday, China's central bank and other authorities called for more measures to strengthen financial support for private companies, including allowing increased issuance of loans, bonds and shares.\nThe central bank governor earlier this month said: \"transforming the economic growth mode is more important than pursuing a high growth rate,\" suggesting an urgent need for longer-term structural reforms as investment-led growth loses steam.\nChina's blue chip CSI300 index fell 1.21% after the data while Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.07%.\nState-owned firms posted a 9.9% decline in earnings in the first 10 months, foreign firms recorded a 10.2% slide and private-sector companies saw profits down 1.9%, according to a breakdown of the NBS data.\nIndustrial profits data covers firms with annual revenues of at least 20 million yuan ($2.74 million) from their main operations.\n($1 = 7.2922 Chinese yuan)\n(Reporting by Joe Cash, Liz Lee and Qiaoyi Li.

        "text": "\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The fallout from the actors strike, now past 100 days, has been widespread throughout the film industry. Movies large and small have postponed. Sound stages remain shuttered. Adjacent industries have been devastated.\nAnother effect is that some great performances haven\u2019t gotten the attention they deserve. For most movies, actors haven\u2019t been able to promote their work.\nAs the strike pushes into Hollywood\u2019s awards season, it\u2019s increasingly muting the reception for some of the best performances of the year. With so many out of work due to the strike, no one should cry for muzzled Oscar campaigns. But actors deserve the chance to take a much-deserved bow.\nInterim agreements have permitted some of the fall\u2019s standouts \u2013 among them Sandra H\u00fcller in \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d and Cailee Spaeny in \u201cPriscilla\u201d \u2013 to hit red carpets and bask in standing ovations. And two of the year\u2019s biggest hits \u2013 \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d both likely to be Academy Awards heavyweights \u2014 debuted as actors walked out.\nHopefully, the strike will end in time for some of the stars of upcoming releases to get the attention they deserve, among them Andrew Scott in \u201cAll of Us Strangers,\u201d Aunjanue Ellis in \u201cOrigin,\u201d Emma Stone in \u201cPoor Things,\u201d Jeffrey Wright in \u201cAmerican Fiction\u201d and Carey Mulligan in \u201cMaestro.\u201d Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the studios have continued this week.\nBut to give the best performances of September and October a little shine, here are some of the standouts you might have missed during the SAG-AFTRA work stoppage, and where to watch them.\nLILY GLADSTONE\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d boasts some of the best work in years by a pair of longtime Scorsese collaborators in Leonardo DiCaprio (as the easily corrupted Ernest Burkhart) and Robert De Niro (as the venal local power broker William Hale). But this is Lily Gladstone\u2019s movie. As Mollie Kyle, she\u2019s the preternaturally calm and graceful presence amid a churning hive of 1920s criminality. Some could fairly wish the film was more given over to Mollie\u2019s perspective, but Gladstone\u2019s gentle power in \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d doesn\u2019t need to assert itself. It\u2019s self-evident. (Currently in theaters)\nPAUL GIAMATTI, DA\u2019VINE JOY RANDOLPH, DOMINIC SESSA\nChoosing just one performance to isolate in Alexander Payne\u2019s \u201cThe Holdovers\u201d is a fool\u2019s errand. First, there\u2019s Paul Giamatti. In his second film with Payne, following \u201cSideways,\u201d he plays a curmudgeon instructor at a 1970s boarding school tasked with staying over Christmas break with a handful of students. Sessa, in his first film, is among them. Randolph, the school cook whose son has died in Vietnam, is there, too. Each is stellar in radically different ways but ultimately the same one: They comically and empathetically imbue their characters with humanity. (Playing in theaters)\nJAMIE FOXX\nJamie Foxx has a ball playing a flamboyant personal injury lawyer who sounds more like he\u2019s preaching from the pulpit than cross-examining a witness in Maggie Betts\u2019 \u201cThe Burial.\u201d Foxx\u2019s attorney takes a case out of his comfort zone in defending a mild-mannered Mississippi funeral home owner (Tommy Lee Jones) against a corporate chain buying up local businesses. Foxx and Jones prove a surprisingly well-suited duo in this crowd-pleasing, throwback courtroom drama. (Streaming on Amazon Prime Video)\nJODIE FOSTER\nElizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin\u2019s \u201cNyad\u201d is first and foremost a showcase for Annette Bening, who gives a tenacious, vanity-free performance as the marathon swimmer Diana Nyad. But so much of what makes \u201cNyad\u201d a touch more than a conventional sports drama is Jodie Foster\u2019s supporting turn as Bonnie Stoll, Nyad\u2019s close friend and trainer. \u201cNyad\u201d is often less about its namesake than how the people in Nyad\u2019s life respond to her obsessive drive. Foster, a rare presence on movie screens these days, has seemingly only grown more confident and at ease as an actor. (Now streaming on Netflix)\nGAEL GARC\u00cdA BERNAL\n\u201cCassandro,\u201d another sports biopic with a courageous queer protagonist, chronicles the scrappy rise of Mexican American luchador Sa\u00fal Armendariz, a.k.a. Cassandro. Bernal (\u201cAmores Perros\u201d and \u201cY tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\u201d) pours himself into the inspirational story of the groundbreaking wrestler. It\u2019s among Bernal\u2019s most nimble transformations \u2014 not just physically in the ring but in embodying the sheer joy and undaunted spirit of a natural performer. (Streaming on Amazon Prime Video)\nEVE HEWSON\nYou may have noted Eve Hewson, daughter of Bono, in ensembles like Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cThe Knick\u201d or in the Irish comedy series \u201cBad Sisters.\u201d But John Carney\u2019s \u201cFlora and Son,\u201d a charming movie about music and rebirth, gives her center stage. Hewson stars as a working-class single mother in Dublin whose online guitar lessons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the instructor) transforms her life and her relationship with her 14-year-old son (Or\u00e9n Kinlan). Just as Carney\u2019s \u201cOnce\u201d was a breakthrough for Glen Hansard and Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1, Hewson is a revelation in \u201cFlora and Son.\u201d (Streaming on Apple TV+)\nCOLMAN DOMINGO\nColman Domingo has long been a powerhouse on screen. (Among many other things, he was the menacing pimp of \u201cZola.\u201d) But George C. Wolfe's \u201cRustin,\u201d a biopic of the civil rights leader Bayard Rustin, gives Domingo the kind of grand, historical platform that can define an actor. The film is set mainly during the run-up to the 1963 March on Washington, which Rustin was the architect of. Rustin was a complicated figure \u2014 a dedicated activist and an openly gay man \u2014 yet Domingo's layered, astute performance captures him fully. (Playing in limited theaters Nov. 3, streams Nov. 17 on Netflix)\nAARON PIERRE\nEven though Garth Davis\u2019 \u201cFoe\u201d is a bit of a dystopian soup, Aaron Pierre proves an arresting, penetrating presence. The film is led by committed performances by Saoirse Ronan and Paul Mescal, who play a couple living in an old farmhouse in a science-fiction future. But when a mysterious visitor (Pierre) arrives with disquieting news \u2013 Junior (Mescal) is to be sent to a space station \u2013 he becomes a regular, vaguely malevolent houseguest with unclear motives. Not everything quite works in \u201cFoe\u201d but Pierre is electrically beguiling. (Playing in theaters)\nPHOEBE DYNEVOR, ALDEN EHRENREICH\nIn Chloe Domont's high-finance drama \u201cFair Play,\u201d Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich start out lovebirds and end up bitter rivals, but the two actors steadfastly remain equally riveting throughout. The film, about two hedge fund analysts in a secret relationship, puts gender roles through a Wall Street meat grinder. For Dynevor, it's a breakthrough. For Ehrenreich, it's a kind of post-\"Solo\" comeback. (Streaming on Netflix)\nMARSHAWN LYNCH\nNo, that\u2019s not a misprint. Marshawn Lynch, the former elite NFL running back known as \u201cBeast Mode,\u201d is tremendous in a small role in Emma Seligman\u2019s raunchy lesbian teen comedy \u201cBottoms.\u201d Most of the movie belongs to Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri \u2013 both chaotically brilliant \u2013 who play high-schoolers who start a quasi Fight Club in a convoluted scheme to bring them closer to their crushes. Lynch plays the teacher who sponsors them. It\u2019s not just a funny performance but a poignant one for the footballer. Lynch did it, he\u2019s said, because he had regrets about how he handled his own sister\u2019s coming out in high school.

The popular military blogger 'Operation Z' said the Dnipro group was deployed in southern Ukraine, where the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said on Oct. 19 that Ukrainian forces appeared to have broken through Russian lines on the left, southern bank of the Dnipro River.\nRussia said it had foiled attempts to cross the river, however.\nTeplinsky was appointed in June 2022 to head the elite airborne forces, which had suffered heavy casualties in the earliest days of the war in Ukraine.\nBritish military intelligence said he was dismissed from a senior role in Ukraine in January, but later reinstated. It said he was likely to be one of the few senior generals \"widely respected by the rank-and-file\".\nIn April, Teplinsky was shown on video meeting President Vladimir Putin.\nSome Russian sources had suggested that Teplinsky's position was in danger after the Wagner mercenary group staged a brief mutiny in June, took control of the southern city of Rostov and advanced largely unopposed towards Moscow before reaching an agreement with the Kremlin to stand down.\nOn Aug. 2, Teplinsky made a speech to members and veterans of the airborne service in honour of Paratroopers' Day, in which he said at least 8,500 paratroopers had been wounded in Ukraine.\nA clip from the speech was published by the defence ministry news outlet Zvezda, but removed within hours for reasons that were unclear.\nBorn on Jan. 9, 1969 in Soviet Ukraine, in the now war-torn Donetsk region, Teplinsky served with Russian forces in Moldova's Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transdniestria after the Soviet Union broke up.\nHe fought in two wars in Chechnya, where Russia crushed an Islamist insurgency, and took part in Russian military operations in support of President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's civil war.

        "text": "\n(Updates headline)\nNov 22 (Reuters) - Israel and Hamas have agreed to a pause in fighting in Gaza to allow for the release of 50 hostages held by the militant group in exchange for 150 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and also to allow for more aid to enter the enclave.\nWHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF THE DEAL?\nUnder the deal, the two sides agreed to a four-day truce so that 50 women and children under the age of 19 taken hostage could be freed in return for 150 Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli detention.\nThe 50 hostages, among about 240 taken by Hamas in their Oct. 7 raid on Israel, are expected to be released in batches, probably about a dozen a day, during the four-day ceasefire.\nSides to the deal have called the break in hostilities \"a humanitarian pause\". The pause will be extended by a day for each additional batch of 10 hostages released, Israel said in a statement.\nHamas said Israel had agreed to halt air traffic over the north of Gaza from 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) until 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) each day of the truce and to halt all air traffic over the south for the entire period. The group said Israel agreed not to attack or arrest anyone in Gaza, and people can move freely along Salah al-Din Street, the main road along which many Palestinians have fled northern Gaza where Israel launched its ground invasion.\nQatar's chief negotiator in ceasefire talks, Minister of State at the Foreign Ministry Mohammed Al-Khulaifi, said that under the deal there would be \"no attack whatsoever. No military movements, no expansion, nothing.\" He said Qatar hoped it would \"be a seed to a bigger agreement and a permanent cease of fire.\"\nWHEN DOES THE DEAL START?\nSpeaking early on Wednesday, the Qatari negotiator said the timing for the start of the truce would be announced within 24 hours.\nIsrael delayed the start to give time for its Supreme Court to hear a challenge to the deal raised by those who say a truce was too much of a concession to Hamas. A court ruling is not expected to derail the deal.\nAn Egyptian source said the truce could start as early as 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Thursday.\nHOW WILL IT BE IMPLEMENTED?\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross will work in Gaza to facilitate the release of the hostages, Qatar said.\nThe hostages are expected to be transported through Egypt, the only country apart from Israel to share a border with Gaza.\nDuring the truce, trucks loaded with aid and fuel are expected to cross into Gaza, where 2.3 million people have been running out of food and many hospitals have shut down in part because they no longer have fuel for their generators.\nWHO ARE THE HOSTAGES BEING RELEASED?\nHamas has not released a full list of names of those being held in Gaza. A U.S. official said the group had said it needed a pause \"to locate and determine where people are\". Not all the hostages taken on Oct. 7 were being held by Hamas fighters.\nAmong the 50 women and children under the age of 19 being released by Hamas are three U.S. citizens, including a girl who turns 4 on Friday, the U.S. official said.\nIn addition to Israeli civilians and soldiers taken on Oct. 7, more than half the roughly 240 hostages are foreign and dual nationals from about 40 countries including Argentina, Britain, Chile, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Thailand and the U.S., Israel's government has said.\nWHO ARE THE PALESTINIANS BEING FREED AND WHY WERE THEY HELD?\nIsrael has provided a list of about 300 Palestinian prisoners who might be released - double the number of women and minors it has agreed to be freed at first - and suggested it expects more than 50 hostages to be released under the deal.\nThe Palestinian Prisoners Society said that as of Wednesday, 7,200 prisoners were being held by Israel, among them 88 women and 250 children 17 and under.\nMost on the list of 300 are from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jerusalem and were held for incidents such as attempted stabbings, hurling stones at Israeli soldiers, making explosives, damaging property and having contacts with hostile organisations. None are accused of murder. Many were held under administrative detention, meaning they were held without trial.\nThe released prisoners could be taken by buses to the presidential headquarters of the Palestinian Authority first as in past releases, even though Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had no role in these truce negotiations, a Palestinian official said.\nWHO NEGOTIATED THE DEAL?\nQatar played a large mediation role. Hamas has a political office in Doha and the Qatari government has kept channels of communication open with Israel, even though unlike some other Gulf Arab states it has not normalised ties with Israel.\nThe United States also played a crucial role, with U.S. President Joe Biden holding calls with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the weeks leading up to the deal.\nEgypt, the first Arab state to sign a peace deal with Israel and which has long played a mediation role over the decades of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was also involved.\nWHY HAS IT TAKEN SO LONG TO NEGOTIATE?\nThe deal was announced 46 days after the start of the war, one of the most fierce conflicts to erupt between the two sides. Hamas fighters killed 1,200 people when they launched their raid on Israel, the biggest single-day toll on Israeli soil since its creation in 1948, and more than 13,000 people have been killed in the Israeli air strikes and land incursion since then, the most by far of any recent war.\nAmid such ferocious fighting, the large number of hostages and Israel's stated determination to wipe out Hamas in Gaza, mediating even a temporary deal, like this one, proved far more challenging than in previous conflicts.\nThe initial negotiations for a deal between Israel and Hamas, both sworn enemies, began within days of the Oct. 7 attack but progress was slow. This was partly because communications between the warring sides had to go via Doha or Cairo and back for every detail hammered out, such as securing a full list from Hamas for those to be released, U.S. officials said.\nEven with a deal in place, the ceasefire is temporary. Hamas has said throughout the truce its \"fingers remain on the trigger\". Israel has said the conflict will continue until all the hostages are freed and Hamas is eliminated.\nIn 2014, when Israel last launched a major land invasion in Gaza, it took 49 days for both sides to implement a ceasefire deal, but that brought major fighting to an end for several years.\n(Editing by Edmund Blair and Howard Goller)",

        "text": "\nAfter two years of higher spending, consumers are battling challenges like rising interest rates, dwindling savings, the return of student loan payments, and credit card debt.\n\"Call it choiceful, discerning, careful, cautious,\" Telsey Advisory Group CEO Dana Telsey told Yahoo Finance Live. \"It's going to be a cautious [holiday] season.\"\nJCPenney CEO Marc Rosen told Yahoo Finance that its customers, who typically earn a median household income of $75,000, are facing \"bills that are $700 more a month\" compared to two years ago, \"whether that's fuel prices, rent, or food.\"\nRetailers, in turn, are facing slowing sales \u2014 unless they break out the coupon books.\nBest Buy (BBY), Nordstrom (JWN), Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), and Target (TGT) all saw same-store sales decline compared to last year in their latest quarterly earnings, whereas value-oriented retailers Walmart (WMT) and TJ Maxx parent TJX Companies (TJX) saw low-single-digit gains.\nOnline or in-store, the deals started earlier. Companies like JCPenney, Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and Macy's kicked off Black Friday-type deals in October and early November.\n\"Across the board, [retailers] are all being highly promotional to make sure that they are earning and keeping their core shoppers and not getting affected by the continued trade-down effect,\" Julie Van Ullen, Rakuten Rewards chief revenue officer told Yahoo Finance over the phone.\nRakuten, which is a shopping platform that offers cash back for online shoppers, is giving as much as 20% cash back at Macy's brand Bloomingdale's and at more than a dozen other retailers.\nRead more: 6 ways to save money on your Black Friday shopping list\nOn a call with investors, Nordstrom CEO Erik B. Nordstrom said the retailer is using promotions as a lever to increase foot traffic, which \"has been down a bit.\"\nSpecials like its members-only 5x Beauty rewards are \"driving extra traffic\u201d and helping with loyalty program sign-ups, said Nordstrom.\nWhere there are deals, consumers are responding. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 20, online shoppers have spent $63.2 billion, up 5% from last year, according to an e-commerce report from Adobe Analytics.\nDeeply discounted categories include electronics (24% off list price), toys (23%), apparel (21%), televisions (19%), appliances (17%), sporting goods (15%), and furniture (13%).\nAs a result, online sales for toys are up 76% compared to October, and sales for appliances and apparel are up 30% and 22%, respectively.\nThat momentum is expected to continue throughout this week. During Cyber Week \u2014 the five-day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday \u2014 the industry is projected to see $37.2 billion dollars in online spending, roughly 17% of the total holiday season.\nAffordable retailers are cashing in. On a call with investors, TJX Companies CEO Ernie Herrman said the company is \"set up very well to be top of mind for consumers\" this holiday season, as its value perception is resonating.\nWhen there is \"uncertainty in the macro environment,\" customers are expecting promotions, Kohl's CFO Jill Timm said on a call with investors. The chain plans to \"really lean into promotions in the fourth quarter,\" Timm added.\nTaking everything into consideration though, the current promotional landscape isn\u2019t too far out of the norm, per incoming Macy's CEO Tony Spring.\n\"I'm 36 years into this, and I haven't known the fourth quarter that isn't competitive and isn't promotional,\" Spring said on a call with investors.\nHowever, Macy\u2019s will need to be \"nimble and competitive with promotions as needed ... to end the fourth quarter in an appropriate inventory position,\" said Spring.\nWhen asked which retailer will come out on top this week, Van Ullen said that retailers who are on the ball and responding quickly to consumer preferences will have the upper hand.\nFocusing on real-time data allows \"brands and retailers to pivot and be as nimble as possible during this time.\"\nShe added: \"The best thing that we can all do together is share insights and be nimble in order to create strategies that allow merchants to offload inventory gluts.\"\n\u2014\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Hollywood\u2019s months of labor unrest are coming to an end, but the post-strike landscape that awaits actors and writers may be far from happily-ever-after.\nThe film and television industry could rightly celebrate the conclusion this week of a bruising, protracted work stoppage that began in May when the Writers Guild hit the picket lines and gathered more force when Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists members walked out in mid-July.\nThe strikes were historic in their length and cost, causing an estimated $6 billion in economic loss and leaving hundreds of thousands out of work. As Hollywood on Thursday began rushing back to production and stars again hit red carpets, many were surely still nursing wounds from a bitter feud with the studios, even after a deal that the guild says won actors a hefty boost to minimum pay and protections over the use of artificial intelligence.\nSAG-AFTRA\u2019s board was to vote on approving the contract Friday afternoon.\nBut as actors swap their picket signs for audition sides and call sheets, they\u2019ll be returning to an industry still in the midst of painful transformation and streaming upheaval.\nThe strikes were prompted largely by the streaming wars, a digital land-rush to populate platforms like Disney+ and HBO Max (now just \u201cMax\u201d) with enough content to rival Netflix. That helter-skelter transition threw much of the economics of entertainment out of whack. One of the most contentious issues of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s negotiations with the studios was the union\u2019s attempt to win a percentage \u2014 1 or 2% \u2014 of streaming revenue, to replace lost residuals. In the end, the actors accepted a bonus tied to viewership.\nBut even before the strike, every studio was reexamining its streaming strategy. After several years of rampant green lights, most are pulling back, looking to make fewer series and movies, cutting staff and desperately seeking a path toward profitability. Wall Street, no longer enamored with subscriber numbers, wants to see profit, too.\nThe aftermath of the strike may look less like a party and more like a streaming hangover.\n\u201cThe streaming business is completely screwed up. There\u2019s too much content and nobody seems to be able to make any profit from it,\u201d says Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab and author of \u201cThe End of Reality: How Four Billionaires are Selling a Fantasy Future of the Metaverse, Mars, and Crypto.\u201d\nBoth strikes, Taplin says, were successful because the guilds gained bulwarks against potential decimation by artificial intelligence. But the road ahead, during which he expects linear television to collapse and some streaming services to go out of business, will be strained.\n\u201cThe whole business is in a complete uproar,\u201d says Taplin. \u201cIt will sort itself out in the next three to five years, but it\u2019s going to be painful.\u201d\nThis is the world that awaits actors as they rush back to sets: Better pay but fewer jobs and intense competition. Puck\u2019s Matt Belloni wrote: \u201cWhat should be a time of relief and celebration in Hollywood is more akin to what soldiers experience in countless war movies \u2014 the horrors of battle give way to the equally grim reality of the new world for which they fought.\u201d\nStill, the strikes recalibrated power in Hollywood, winning gains for actors and writers and rallying union support throughout the industry. More battles loom. The contract for International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents crew members, expires at the end of July.\nMeanwhile, for months studios have signaled they\u2019re downsizing. Earlier this week, Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger in an earnings call where he touted the financial benefits of more than 8,000 job cuts, said the company is focused on consolidating: \u201cMake less, focus more on quality.\u201d\n\u201cAt the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making,\u201d Iger said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always felt that quantity can be actually a negative when it comes to quality. And I think that\u2019s exactly what happened. We lost some focus.\u201d\nNetflix, which earlier set its sights on a new original movie every week, has said it\u2019s now aiming for about half that. Hulu, which Disney plans to bundle with Disney+ after acquiring Comcast\u2019s stake, is slimming down. Peacock lost $2.8 billion this year, Comcast has said; it announced layoffs to its marketing department Thursday.\nWarner Bros. Discovery chief executive David Zaslav has taken drastic steps to get Max in order while the studio post-merger carries $43 billion in debt.\n\u201cThis is a generational disruption we\u2019re going through,\u201d Zaslav said Wednesday. \u201cGoing through that with a streaming service that\u2019s losing billions of dollars is really, really difficult to go on offense.\u201d\nCancellations have grown more commonplace as streamers get more selective. Due in part to the strikes, series production will dip for the first time in years in 2023 after reaching an all-time high last year, when 599 original series were made. Peak TV, some say , is over.\nBut there are still huge amounts of money being thrown around. Apple Studios, for one, is behind two of the fall\u2019s biggest budget films in Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d and Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon.\u201d\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA\u2019s lead negotiator, remains optimistic about what\u2019s ahead.\n\"I recognize that during a strike, sometimes rhetoric gets heated. People sometimes say things with the intention of sort of generating a reaction,\u201d Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said Wednesday. \u201cAnd so I think really we will see over the coming days, weeks and months what the industry\u2019s real intentions are. But my expectation is that they do really want to get people back to work and that they\u2019ll do so.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Krysta Fauria contributed to this report from Los Angeles.",

        "text": "\nBy Andre Romani\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian financial tech company StoneCo plans to multiply net profits eightfold through the end of 2027 by accelerating the integration of its financial services and software operations, CEO Pedro Zinner said in an interview ahead of an investor event in New York on Wednesday.\nThe firm will continue to focus on the micro, small and medium-sized business (MSMB) client segments, while maintaining a controlled level of investment, Zinner said.\nStoneCo is projecting adjusted net profit of at least 1.9 billion reais in 2024 and at least 4.3 billion reais in 2027, an aggressive target after closing last year with an adjusted net profit of 526 million reais. The bullish guidance comes on the heels of a more than 300% increase in adjusted profit for the third quarter year-on-year, which boosted the company's 12.9% on Monday in New York. \"In recent years, the company has built a super-profitable, cash-generating business model. What we're doing now is basically taking advantage of and leveraging these opportunities, to use this cash to grow our business and improve profitability,\" Zinner told Reuters. The desired growth in profits from expansion in the MSMB segment will be driven by more effective use of distribution tools for services and products, whether online or physical, StoneCo said. The volume of payments processed by the company in the MSMB segment is expected to exceed 412 billion reais in 2024 and reach over 600 billion reais in 2027, compared to 290 billion reais last year.\nThe segment's take rate, which is a fee collected for enabling third-party transactions, is expected to rise from 2.49% next year to 2.70% in 2027, according to the company. In 2022, it stood at 2.15%. StoneCo's core business is payment processing, especially for MSMBs. With the acquisition of Linx, it also has now a significant presence in the business management software space.\n(Reporting by Andr\u00e9 Romani; Writing by Peter Frontini; Editing by Ana Mano and Cynthia Osterman)",

It affirmed Washington\u2019s Aaa issuer rating, while also cutting its outlook on the Smithsonian Institution in DC and the Washington Convention & Sports Authority to negative.\nMoody\u2019s lowered its outlook on the US Friday, signaling it was inclined to downgrade the nation from the top Aaa level because of wider budget deficits and political polarization.

Washington is \u201cparticularly exposed to federal government employment and wages derived from it,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.\nWhile DC sets its tax rates, Congress must approve the district\u2019s annual budget, Moody\u2019s. \u201cCongress has ultimate authority over the District and thus DC does not have the fiscal autonomy that states do,\u201d according to the report.\nMoody\u2019s is the only one of the three main credit companies that still rates the US in the top tier after Fitch Ratings downgraded the US government in August following the debt-ceiling battle and S&P Global Ratings stripped the US of its top score in 2011 amid that year\u2019s debt-limit crisis.\nMoody\u2019s says that given the negative DC outlook, it is unlikely to upgrade Washington\u2019s ratings in the next 12 to 18 months and may consider a downgrade if the US rating is lowered.

That was broadly in line with expectations after the People\u2019s Bank of China kept a key policy rate called the medium-term lending facility rate on hold last week. The loan rates are quoted as a spread over that rate and usually but don\u2019t always track its moves.\nPolicymakers and lenders have cut their rates on a handful of occasions this year to help the economic recovery, though their room to maneuver has become more limited due to pressures on the yuan and capital outflows, along with narrowing profit margins for banks. A rise in time deposits also pushed up lenders\u2019 costs. That means China has been looking at other ways to boost liquidity and support lending.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much room to lower the LPRs further\u201d due to previous reductions in mortgage and other loan rates, said Bruce Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. \u201cCoordinating credit extension pace and stepping up credit support to targeted sectors is a better way to expand domestic demand and lift confidence.\u201d\nThat shift in focus was apparent last Friday, when the PBOC and other financial regulators told the country\u2019s biggest lenders and asset managers to meet all \u201creasonable\u201d funding needs from property firms. They said banks should coordinate credit growth from now through early next year, adding that a stable expansion of credit can help boost the economy.\nThat meeting signaled \u201ca smoother pace of credit support,\u201d Pang said. Loan growth is usually slower in the final months of the year, before banks push to hit their lending targets in the first quarter. This year credit growth was strong in the first three months because of the post-pandemic reopening, but borrowing demand has been weak ever since.\n\u201cCredit figures will be better in November and December, to avoid any self-fulfilling panic in the market about the state of the economy,\u201d Pang added.\nChina\u2019s Loan Prime Rates\nOne-year loan prime rate held at 3.45%, in line with expectations among 17 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg\nFive-year rate kept at 4.2%, matching estimates from 15 of 16 economists\nThe offshore yuan extended morning gains to trade 0.5% stronger than the dollar to 7.1816, as sentiment buoyed risk-assets globally. Ten-year government bond yields were little changed at 2.66%.\nAlongside encouraging lenders to keep credit growth stable through the rest of the year, the PBOC has taken other measures to support the economy short of rate cuts. After keeping its one-year policy rate unchanged last week, the PBOC pumped the most cash into the financial system since late 2016 through those loans. That was intended to help meet liquidity needs spurred by Beijing\u2019s move to support the economy via an unusual sale of sovereign bonds.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says ...\n\u201cThe decision by China\u2019s commercial lenders to keep their prime rates steady on Monday was almost a foregone conclusion after the People\u2019s Bank of China held rates last week. The question is, what\u2019s next? We expect additional easing, but with measures focused more on stimulating credit growth rather than lowering borrowing costs.\u201d\n\u2014 Eric Zhu, economist\nRead the full report here.\n\u201cQuantitative measures \u2013 liquidity injections \u2013 are still preferred over outright interest rate cuts to stimulate economic activities,\u201d said Frances Cheung, a rates strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. \u201cWith the earlier outsized MLF operations, the authorities may adopt a wait-and-see approach for now regarding further liquidity releases but an RRR cut is still possible.\u201d\nThe outsized cash injection sparked discussion over whether the central bank will still cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks \u2014 which determines the amount of cash lenders need to keep in reserve \u2014 before the end of the year. Citigroup Inc. economists have said last week\u2019s move may mean the RRR cut is delayed into 2024.\n--With assistance from Qizi Sun and Wenjin Lv.\n(Updates with additional details throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High\nThe Impact and Cost of Musk\u2019s Endorsement of Antisemitism on X\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\nInflation Raging in Triple Digits Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nA hawkish lean from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell chilled a recent rebound in stocks and bonds, with some investors suggesting the central bank was pushing back against loosening financial conditions.\nSpeaking at an International Monetary Fund conference on Thursday, Powell said the Fed would \"not hesitate\" to tighten monetary policy if needed and that the fight to restore price stability \"had a long way to go.\"\nThough the comments did not go much beyond those given after the Fed's Oct. 31 - Nov. 1 monetary policy meeting, some investors believe Powell\u2019s tone was more hawkish compared with those earlier remarks, which contributed to last week's powerful rebound in stocks and Treasuries.\nBy contrast, the S&P 500 fell 0.8% on Thursday, snapping an eight-day winning streak that was its longest in two years. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which move inversely to bond prices, rose 12 basis points, their largest one-day gain in three weeks.\n\"Powell seemed to be course-correcting some of the dovish comments from last week and circling back to the idea that the Fed is prepared to raise rates again if they need to,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.\nSome investors said Powell may have been leaning against a recent loosening of financial conditions that has come as yields have tumbled in recent weeks. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has fallen nearly 40 basis points to 4.63%, from a 16-year high of just above 5%.\nEvidence of the dynamic between yields and financial conditions - factors that reflect the availability of funding in an economy - was on display in last week's 0.5% decline in the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index, its sixth-biggest weekly drop since 1990.\nAverage rates on 30-year mortgages, which move together with Treasury yields, fell 25 basis points last week, the largest weekly tumble in nearly 16 months. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 5.5% from its October lows.\n\"The noticeable drop in yields from last week may have caused some caution at the FOMC, which then led Chair Powell \u2026 talking up yields again,\" said Spencer Hakimian, CEO of Tolou Capital Management, a New York-based macro hedge fund.\n\"If their concept is to have tighter financial conditions, they can\u2019t really let those yields go down. They need them to stay restrictive in order to not actually have to raise rates,\" he said.\nSonal Desai, chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, echoed that sentiment, saying the Fed was trying to calm \"an exuberance\" it unintentionally created in the markets.\n\"The rally of the markets both in equity and fixed income unwound the financial conditions tightening to a large degree,\" Desai said. \"This is Powell pushing back against markets trying to put into his mouth the words \u2018mission accomplished.'\"\nAt the same time, the weakest auction for 30-year Treasuries since August 2011 also hit government bond prices. Yields on the 30-year Treasury recently stood at 4.77%, from a low of 4.6% earlier this week.\n\"The rates market was still somewhat jittery after the auction so higher yields were the path of least resistance,\" said Vassili Serebriakov, a foreign exchange strategist at UBS.\nInvestors are awaiting U.S. consumer price data next week, which could show how the Fed is faring in its fight to keep lowering inflation from last year\u2019s multi-decade highs.\n\"Chairman Powell issued a warning to investors too giddy on the prospect of rate cuts next year,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, in a note. However, \"next week\u2019s inflation data should provide some salve for the markets as headline inflation will likely be soft from easing energy prices.\"\n(Reporting Davide Barbuscia and David Randall; Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Karen Brettell; Writing by Ira Iosebashvili; Editing by Sam Holmes)",

        "text": "\nBy Chibuike Oguh and Jonathan Stempel\nNEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Shares in Douglas Elliman , Redfin, Compass and eXp World Holdings fell on Wednesday after they were sued for allegedly conspiring to artificially inflate their commissions from home sales.\nThe proposed class action lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in Kansas City, Missouri just hours after a jury there found the National Association of Realtors and other brokerages, including Berkshire Hathaway's HomeServices of America, liable to pay $1.78 billion in damages for similar commission practices.\nDamages in that first case could be tripled under federal antitrust law to more than $5.3 billion.\nThe verdict could upend decades-old practices that have allowed real estate agents to boost commissions by forcing sellers to pay commissions to buyers' real estate brokers. Home sellers complained that this model suppressed competition.\nShares of the new defendants fell between 3% and 7% on Wednesday.\nBoth suits were filed in the U.S. District Court in Western Missouri by the same lawyer. The first suit was brought on behalf of sellers of more than 260,000 homes in Missouri, Kansas and Illinois between 2015 and 2022. Tuesday's lawsuit is on behalf of sellers nationwide.\nA spokesperson for eXP said the company was still studying the complaint, adding: \"We are committed to upholding fair and transparent practices compliant with law and we already have mechanisms and a plan in place that enables buyers and sellers to negotiate commissions.\"\nSpokespeople for Compass and Douglas Elliman declined to comment. A Redfin spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBTIG analyst Soham Bhonsle in an investor note said the fact that Douglas Elliman, Redfin, Compass and eXp were being sued by the same lawyers was a negative for their stocks.\nShares of Re/Max and Anywhere Real Estate, two other brokerages that had initially been defendants in the first suit but settled prior to trial, were up 4% and down 1.6%, respectively on Wednesday. Both had fallen on Tuesday despite their earlier settlements.\nZillow shares fell 0.33% after brokerage Jefferies cut its price target, citing the impact of Tuesday's verdict. While Zillow is not a defendant in either lawsuit, Jefferies said Tuesday's verdict \"increases the chances of a ban on commission sharing and Zillow having to pivot the business model.\"\nOn Tuesday, spokespeople for NAR and HomeServices said they planned to appeal.

        "text": "\nBy Jamie McGeever\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\nAsian markets round out the week on Friday in reasonably good spirits, with a deluge of purchasing managers index data from across the continent and a sprinkling of key indicators from Japan, South Korea and Indonesia the most likely market-moving catalysts.\nFriday is also the first trading day of December, so perhaps an opportunity to get the last month of the year off to a positive start.\nThe Dow Jones on Thursday posted its highest close in nearly two years, and if broader market momentum from November spills over, that is a likely scenario - for some Asian stock markets, November was the best month in a long time.\nOn the other hand, Thursday's month-end reversal in the dollar and bonds - the dollar and Treasury yields rose sharply - will sound a loud note of caution.\nUnemployment data from Japan, trade data from South Korea, and the latest readout on inflation from Indonesia are among the highlights on the Asian economic calendar, along with a raft of purchasing managers index reports from across the region.\nThey include Australia, South Korea and India, as well as China's 'unofficial' PMI. The 'official' PMI report from the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed that manufacturing activity in China shrank for a second month in November, and at a faster rate than had been expected.\nA similar reading on Friday will only enhance the already growing calls for more stimulus.\nChina's leading index of blue chip stocks fell 2% in November, its fourth monthly decline in a row. It is down almost 10% year-to-date, underperforming most of its regional and global peers.\nThe MSCI Asia ex-Japan and emerging market indexes both snapped three-month losing streaks in November, rising 7% or more for their best month since January, while Japan's Nikkei gained 8.5% for its best month in three years.\nThe general gloom surrounding China's economy and financial markets shows little sign of lifting, despite some sporadic positive surprises recently like the strong third quarter GDP growth figures.\nA survey by central banking think tank OMFIF of 22 public pension and sovereign wealth funds managing $4.3 trillion in assets, showed that none reported a positive outlook for China's economy.\nThey cited the regulatory environment and geopolitics among primary factors dissuading them from investing. Foreigners already appear to be voting with their feet - China just recorded its first-ever quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment.\nAs more aggressive Fed rate cut expectations chip away at the U.S. dollar, investors are turning more bullish on Asian currencies, a Reuters poll found. Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the few exceptions is the Chinese yuan.\nStill, the yuan is trading around its strongest level against the dollar since June and just clocked its biggest monthly gain in a year, rising around 2.5% in November.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday:\n- PMIs for Australia, South Korea, India, China\n- Japan unemployment (October)\n- Indonesia inflation (October)\n(By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)",

        "text": "\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump has testified in court as a football owner, casino builder and airline buyer. He bragged in a deposition that he saved \u201cmillions of lives\u201d by deterring nuclear war as president. Another time, he fretted about the dangers of flung fruit.\nConditioned by decades of trials and legal disputes, Trump is now poised to reprise his role as witness under extraordinary circumstances: as a former Republican president fighting to save the real estate empire that vaulted him to stardom and the White House.\nTrump is set to testify Monday at his New York civil fraud trial, taking the stand in a deeply personal matter that is central his image as a successful businessman and threatens to cost him control of marquee properties such as Trump Tower. His highly anticipated testimony in the trial of New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit follows that of his eldest sons, Trump Organization executives Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who testified last week. His eldest daughter, Ivanka, is set to testify on Wednesday.\nTrump has testified in court in at least eight trials since 1986, according to an Associated Press review of court records and news coverage. He also has been questioned under oath in more than a dozen depositions and regulatory hearings.\nIn 1985, he was called to testify before Congress as owner of the USFL\u2019s New Jersey Generals and he testified on behalf of lawyer and friend Roy Cohn at a state disciplinary hearing that led to Cohn\u2019s disbarment. In an early flash of his firebrand persona, in 1986, Trump told New Jersey\u2019s casino commission that plans for highway overpasses near one of his casinos \u201cwould be a disaster. It would be a catastrophe.\u201d\nThose testimonies, captured in thousands of pages of transcripts and some on videotape, offer clues to the approach Trump is likely to take when he testifies Monday. They show clear parallels between Trump as a witness and Trump as a president and current candidate for the office. His rhetorical style in legal proceedings over the years bears echoes of his political verve: a mix of ego, charm, defensiveness, aggressiveness, sharp language and deflection. He has been combative and boastful, but sometimes vague and prone to hedging or being dismissive.\nTestifying in the USFL\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against the NFL in 1986, Trump denounced allegations that he had spied on NFL officials at one of his hotels, calling the claim \u201csuch a false interpretation it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\nIn 1988, as he sought to buy Eastern Air Lines\u2019 Northeast shuttle service, Trump turned on the charisma, flashing a wide smile at the judge\u2019s female law clerks and shaking hands with the bailiff during a break in his testimony at a federal court hearing in Washington. Trump testified that his $365 million purchase, later approved, would be a \u201cmajor boost in morale\u201d for employees.\nOn the stand in a boxing-related case in 1990, Trump described a Mike Tyson fight he planned for one of his casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as \u201cone of the greatest rematches you could have.\u201d Accused by two men of cutting them out of a riverboat gambling project, Trump professed ignorance, testifying in 1999: \u201cI was shocked by this whole case. I had no idea who these people were.\u201d\nTrump was briefly called to the witness stand in the New York case last month to explain comments outside of court that the judge said violated a limited gag order.\nBefore that, he last testified in a courtroom in 2013, two years before launching his winning presidential campaign. An 87-year-old suburban Chicago widower had sued him over changes to contract terms for a hotel and condominium tower she had bought units in as an investment. Trump grew increasingly agitated as his testimony wore on, at one point raising his arms and bellowing: \u201cAnd then she sued me. It\u2019s unbelievable!\u201d\nIn 1990, Trump testified in a losing effort in a lawsuit over his company\u2019s failure to make pension contributions on behalf of about 200 undocumented Polish workers hired to tear down a building to make way for Trump Tower. A year later, he was in court again in Manhattan, testifying against a man who claimed he had a contract to develop Trump\u2019s board game and was owed 25% of profits from \u201cTrump: The Game.\u201d\nTrump won that one and another lawsuit in 2005, where he testified that a construction company had \u201cfleeced\u201d him by overcharging him by $1.5 million for work at a golf course in New York's Westchester County.\nWhen questioned in the past about his business and financial dealings, Trump has sometimes deflected responsibility and blame. In a 2013 deposition over a failed Florida condo project, Trump blamed an employee for paperwork that said he was developing a project when, in reality, he wasn\u2019t.\nAnother refrain in Trump\u2019s depositions is his incredulity that he would be taken so seriously for hyping up his real estate projects.\n\u201cYou always want to put the best possible spin on a property that you can,\u201d Trump said in a December 2007 deposition in his lawsuit against a journalist he had accused of downplaying his wealth. \u201cNo different than any other real estate developer, no different than any other businessman, no different than any politician.\u201d\n__\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.",

        "text": "\nBy Stefano Rebaudo\nOct 27 (Reuters) - Euro area sovereign bonds were on track to end the week roughly unchanged, with the benchmark 10-year Bund yield well below its peak above 3%, after the European Central Bank reiterated policy rates would stay at the current levels for an extended period.\nBond prices move inversely to yields.\nThe ECB left rates unchanged as expected on Thursday and insisted that rising market talk of rate cuts was premature.\nSome analysts spotted some dovish tilts in remarks from ECB President Christine Lagarde, such as \u201cinflation dropped markedly in September\u201d while yields \u201chad risen markedly since our last meeting\u201d, or the fact that she refrained from shifting the focus to the reduction of its balance sheet.\nHowever, Citi analysts said in a research note \u201cthe (ECB) reluctance to convey under which circumstances rates may fall is not however particularly dovish, in the sense that it likely also evidenced that the Council still had rather err on the side of overtightening than undertightening and is prepared to keep policy restrictive until it is absolutely certain that inflation will fall sustainably to or below target.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the euro area, was up one basis point (bp) at 2.86% and on track to end the week down 2 bps.\nThis week\u2019s economic data, including a survey on business activity and bank lending, will probably keep yields capped as it supports expectations for rate cuts in 2024, analysts said.\nMoney markets are pricing almost zero chance for an additional hike by year-end and reductions in policy rates starting from June next year.\nMarkets are also concerned about the Middle East conflict widening beyond Gaza, which might trigger a further rush into safe-haven assets, driving bond yields lower.\nThe Pentagon said on Thursday the U.S. military carried out strikes against two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and groups it backs.\nThe ECB confirmed on Thursday it would continue reinvestments from the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) until the end of 2024. However, President Lagarde said the council had yet to discuss the issue.\nPolicymakers agreed to delay until early 2024 any talk about ending bond buys and bank reserve requirements only as part of a framework review due in the spring, two sources told Reuters.\nMarket reaction was subdued as the spread between Italian and German 10-year yields -- a gauge of the premium investors ask to hold debt of the euro area's most indebted countries \u2013 briefly tightened to 196 bps before getting back above 200 bps late on Thursday.\nIt hit 209.2 bps in early October, its highest level since January. It was last at 199 bps.\nMarkets had already priced in the ECB's cautious stance about PEPP after policy hawks highlighted the need to maintain flexibility while reducing the balance sheet.\nThe ECB can use reinvestments from the PEPP to support bonds of southern Europe's most indebted countries. Lagarde called it the first line of defence against fragmentation \u2013 an excess widening of yield spreads among the euro area's bonds, which might hamper monetary policy transmission.

Bivens, appointed in 2020, emerged as a vocal critic of power-market reforms after a deadly winter storm in early 2021.\nSeparately, Will McAdams, Texas Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s first post-storm appointee to help lead the state\u2019s utility regulator, also plans to resign, according to people familiar with the decision who asked not to be identified.\nThe imminent departure of two key players may force Abbott to recast efforts to shore up an increasingly fragile power grid. More than two years after a historic arctic chill killed hundreds of Texans, blacked out millions and paralyzed the state for almost a week, power-system reforms remain a hotly contested topic in the Lone Star State.\nBivens\u2019 role as market monitor has been to provide neutral analyses of proposed market-rule changes. But the independence of that position was recently thrown into question when the state grid manager known as Ercot sought to extend control over the position.\nRead More: Texas\u2019 New Electricity Rules Sent Grid Prices Soaring\nMcAdams was nominated by Abbott to occupy one of the four Public Utility Commission seats in the aftermath of the February 2021 freeze. The appointment was part of a post-disaster clean sweep of the agency\u2019s leadership.\nThe commission\u2019s brief expanded this week after Texans approved the creation of a $5 billion fund to help finance new power plants via low-interest loans or grants.\nRead More: Texas Voters Back $5 Billion Fund for Fossil-Fuel Power Plants\nSince McAdams joined the commission, the PUC has pushed through reforms to procure more electricity reserves, help cover power-plant fuel costs and oversee implementation of efforts to insure against another grid disaster.

That\u2019s the biggest jump since April, and followed an unexpected 0.6% increase a month earlier, which far exceeded the median estimate of a flat reading in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\nSales were up in four of nine subsectors, led by gains at car and parts dealers, which were up 1.5% in September. Excluding autos, retail sales rose 0.2%, versus expectations for a decrease of 0.1%. In volume terms, retail sales grew 0.3%.\nCanadian government bonds cheapened after the release, with yields on two-year debt rising as much as 5 basis points. The loonie has strengthened 0.7% on the day, the most in more than a week.\nDespite a sharp rebound in headline numbers, details in the report point to consumer weakness.\nCore retail sales, which exclude gas stations and car dealers, were down 0.3% in September. The decline was led by lower sales at sporting goods, hobby and musical instrument retailers as well as beer, wine and liquor stores, suggesting consumers cut back on some discretionary purchases.\nThe release is a \u201creprieve from the consistent softness in the Canadian economic data,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by email. \u201cHowever, given elevated rates and mortgage resets still coming, don\u2019t expect consumer spending to perk up consistently.\u201d\nWith the economy already showing signs of stagnation, the Bank of Canada will probably look past what\u2019s likely to be a temporary pickup in demand, and hold borrowing costs at 5% while waiting for the softening economy to weigh heavier on spending. Accounting for record population growth, core retail sales are declining. Policymakers next set rates on Dec. 6.\nEarlier this week, Governor Tiff Macklem said interest rates may now be restrictive enough to restore to price stability. He added that more downward pressure on inflation is in the pipeline with the economy expected to remain weak for the next few quarters.\nTaking the latest retail data into account, forecasts suggest little to no real gross domestic product growth in the third quarter and only a modest pickup in the fourth, Tiago Figueiredo, a macro strategist at Desjardins Securities, said in a report to investors. \u201cGiven the surge in population growth, these are hardly inspiring GDP forecasts. As a result, we continue to believe the Bank of Canada is done raising rates and that the economy could slip into recession in early 2024.\u201d\nKatherine Judge, an economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a note that the data \u201cwould likely just represent a temporary reprieve, given the climb in the unemployment rate that\u2019s being seen, along with the impact of mortgage renewals at higher interest rates.\u201d\nRegionally, sales increased in eight of 10 provinces in September. The country\u2019s most populous province, Ontario saw the largest provincial increase, led by higher sales at car dealers, but sales were down 0.6% in Toronto, its largest city.\nThe agency didn\u2019t provide details on the October estimate, which was based on responses from 48.7% of companies surveyed.\nIn a separate release, Statistics Canada said advance results showed manufacturing sales declined 2.7% in October, with the largest decreases in petroleum and coal product, machinery and transportation equipment subsectors.\n--With assistance from Danielle Bochove.\n(Updates with economist comments and an additional chart.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

The currencies of other large trading partners, namely the euro zone and Japan, are similarly susceptible to potential US tariff pressures.

        "text": "\n* BOJ considers boosting cap on 10-year yield -Nikkei * Focus on central bank meetings - BOJ, BOE, Fed * U.S. refunding, nonfarm payrolls also a key focus this week (Recasts, adds new comment, Nikkei report on BOJ, updates prices) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen climbed to a two-week peak against the dollar on Monday after a report said the Bank of Japan is considering tweaking its yield curve control policy to allow the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to rise above 1%. The Nikkei report pushed the yen to 148.81 per dollar, its strongest level since Oct. 17. The greenback, which has been on the defensive all day, was last down 0.4% at 149.05 yen. Surging global interest rates have heightened pressure on the BOJ, which kicked off its two-day monetary policy meeting on Monday, to change its bond yield control policy, in which it maintains its -0.1% short-term interest rate target and a 0% cap on the 10-year bond yield. \"If the BOJ does not do anything tomorrow, which I think that's what economists expect and just wait until December, I think the dollar jumps right back versus the yen,\" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. But with Monday's action, Chandler thinks Japanese intervention seems unlikely, although he noted that in the last few weeks, the BOJ has intervened in the bond market as an alternative. \"The key to intervention is excessive volatility and the BOJ has been saying this: that it's not targeting a particular level. So that's taking the magic away from the 150 mark,\" he said. Aside from the BOJ, market participants are looking ahead to interest rate decisions from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England (BoE). A deluge of purchasing managers' surveys, euro zone inflation and GDP data, and U.S. nonfarm payrolls are also due for release this week. \"The U.S. dollar is sliding a little this morning, but not in any measure that puts it trading outside recent ranges,\" said Helen Given, FX trader at Monex USA in Washington. \"If consumer data domestically hadn't been so strong last week, we'd probably be looking at a bigger slide for the dollar, but markets are still finding it quite difficult to discount the resilience of the U.S. economy.\" Analysts also pointed to the U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding announcement on Wednesday that could move both the bond and currency markets. That comes as mounting deficits and a heavier interest rate burden have substantially increased the U.S. Treasury's funding needs. Since the last announcement in August, borrowing rates have spiralled to their highest since 2006-07. The dollar index was last down 0.4% at 106.13, after earlier falling to a one-week low of 106.06, hurt by a pick-up in the euro. The euro was last up 0.5% at $1.0615. In the mix in Europe on Monday was cooling German state inflation data, which pointed to slowing headline inflation in the euro zone's largest economy, and a separate release showing German gross domestic product fell by 0.1% quarter on quarter in the third quarter, though this was above expectations. Later this week, the Fed and BoE are both expected to keep rates steady so, barring any surprises, the focus will be on the message from policymakers. The pound was up 0.2% at $1.2141. U.S. nonfarm payrolls data on Friday will also be important for expectations of the Fed's rate hike path. Wall Street economists are expecting new U.S. jobs of 188,000 for the month of October, according to the Reuters poll. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 2:24PM (1824 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Dollar index 106.1200 106.6000 -0.43% 2.541% +106.7100 +106.0600 Euro/Dollar $1.0614 $1.0565 +0.46% -0.94% +$1.0625 +$1.0547 Dollar/Yen 148.9650 149.6500 -0.44% +13.64% +149.8450 +148.8100 Euro/Yen 158.11 158.10 +0.01% +12.69% +158.9200 +157.7000 Dollar/Swiss 0.9018 0.9021 -0.03% -2.47% +0.9048 +0.9010 Sterling/Dollar $1.2158 $1.2123 +0.31% +0.55% +$1.2164 +$1.2090 Dollar/Canadian 1.3830 1.3872 -0.30% +2.07% +1.3872 +1.3814 Aussie/Dollar $0.6374 $0.6334 +0.67% -6.45% +$0.6384 +$0.6333 Euro/Swiss 0.9570 0.9535 +0.37% -3.28% +0.9583 +0.9526 Euro/Sterling 0.8727 0.8713 +0.16% -1.32% +0.8740 +0.8708 NZ $0.5837 $0.5809 +0.45% -8.10% +$0.5844 +$0.5805 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway 11.1410 11.1820 -0.24% +13.66% +11.1880 +11.1070 Euro/Norway 11.8270 11.8024 +0.21% +12.73% +11.8504 +11.7805 Dollar/Sweden 11.1385 11.1478 +0.59% +7.02% +11.1798 +11.1179 Euro/Sweden 11.8182 11.7487 +0.59% +6.00% +11.8377 +11.7729 (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Alun John in London and Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by Miral Fahmy, Mark Potter, Andrea Ricci and Alexander Smith)",

        "text": "\nBy Luc Cohen, Jody Godoy\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on Thursday of stealing from customers of his now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange in one of the biggest financial frauds on record, a verdict that cemented the 31-year-old former billionaire's fall from grace.\nA 12-member jury in Manhattan federal court convicted Bankman-Fried on all seven counts he faced after a monthlong trial in which prosecutors made the case that he looted $8 billion from the exchange's users out of sheer greed.\nThe verdict came just shy of one year after FTX filed for bankruptcy in a swift corporate meltdown that shocked financial markets and erased his estimated $26 billion personal fortune.\nThe jury reached the verdict after just over four hours of deliberations. Bankman-Fried, who had pleaded not guilty to two counts of fraud and five counts of conspiracy, stood facing the jury with his hands clasped in front of him as the verdict was read.\nThe conviction was a victory for the U.S. Justice Department and Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, who made rooting out corruption in financial markets one of his top priorities.\n\"The crypto industry might be new, the players like Sam Bankman-Fried may be new, but this kind of fraud is as old as time and we have no patience for it,\" Williams told reporters outside the courthouse.\nOnce the darling of the crypto world, Bankman-Fried - who was known for his mop of unkempt curly hair and for wearing shorts and T-shirts rather than business attire - joins the likes of admitted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and \"Wolf of Wall Street\" fraudster Jordan Belfort as notable people convicted of major U.S. financial crimes.\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan set Bankman-Fried's sentencing for March 28, 2024. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate could face decades in prison.\nHis defense lawyer Mark Cohen said in a statement that he was \"disappointed\" but respected the jury's decision.\n\"Mr. Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him,\" he said.\nAfter Kaplan left the courtroom, Cohen put his arm around Bankman-Fried as they spoke at the defense table.\nAs Bankman-Fried was led away by members of the U.S. Marshals service, he turned around and nodded at his parents, the Stanford Law School professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, who were seated in the courtroom audience's front row. Fried looked toward him and crossed her arm across her chest.\nBankman-Fried is set to go on trial next March on a second set of charges brought by prosecutors earlier this year, including for alleged foreign bribery and bank fraud conspiracies.\nBANKMAN-FRIED TESTIFIED IN OWN DEFENSE\nBankman-Fried's was the first of several blockbuster cases Williams brought against former high-flying cryptocurrency executives to go to trial. Several crypto companies went bankrupt last year after the prices of bitcoin and other digital assets collapsed following a years-long boom.\nProsecutors argued during the trial that Bankman-Fried siphoned money from FTX to his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, despite proclaiming on social media and in television advertisements that the exchange prioritized the safety of customer funds.\nAlameda used the money to pay its lenders and to make loans to Bankman-Fried and other executives - who in turn made speculative venture investments and donated upwards of $100 million to U.S. political campaigns in a bid to promote cryptocurrency legislation the defendant viewed as favorable to his business, according to prosecutors.\nBankman-Fried took the calculated risk of testifying in his own defense over three days near the close of trial after three former members of his inner circle testified against him. He faced aggressive cross-examination by the prosecution, often avoiding direct answers to the most probing questions.\nHe testified that while he made mistakes running FTX, such as not formulating a risk-management team, he did not steal customer funds. He said he thought Alameda's borrowing from FTX was allowed and did not realize how large its debts had grown until shortly before both companies collapsed.\n\"We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,\" Bankman-Fried testified. \"It turned out basically the opposite of that.\"\n'HE THOUGHT THE RULES DID NOT APPLY'\nProsecutors had a different view.\n\"He didn't bargain for his three loyal deputies taking that stand and telling you the truth: that he was the one with the plan, the motive and the greed to raid FTX customer deposits - billions and billions of dollars - to give himself money, power, influence. He thought the rules did not apply to him. He thought that he could get away with it,\" prosecutor Danielle Sassoon told the jury on Thursday.\nThe jury heard 15 days of testimony. Former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, testifying for the prosecution after entering guilty pleas, said he directed them to commit crimes, including helping Alameda loot FTX and lying to lenders and investors about the companies' finances.\nThe defense argued the three, who have not yet been sentenced, falsely implicated Bankman-Fried in a bid to win leniency at sentencing. Prosecutors may ask Kaplan to take their cooperation into account in deciding their punishment.\nBankman-Fried has been jailed since August after Kaplan revoked his bail, having concluded he likely tampered with witnesses.\n(Reporting by Luc Cohen and Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Will Dunham, Daniel Wallis and Lincoln Feast)",

But central bankers have said that the door is still open to additional increases, even if officials decide to pause for a time.\nAnd while the market's momentum has swung to a more optimistic reading, investors have plenty of cautious voices to check their exuberance, including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who emphasized both Monday and Tuesday that the central bank likely has more work ahead of it to control inflation. Kashkari was one of several more hawkish members of the Fed to express caution on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak later in the week.\nRead more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\"There was quite a bit of euphoria at the end of last week on the belief that the Fed is done, the jobs market is slowing, that the US economy is going to experience a soft landing,\" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, told Reuters. \"People have started to become a bit more clear-eyed. There is the risk that the Fed could rise again.\"\nThe fresh Fed doubts clouded the outlook for oil, helping push WTI crude prices below $80 a barrel for the first time in over two months despite the prospect of Saudi and Russian supply cuts. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) and Brent crude futures (BZ=F) both sank 4%, to $77.48 and $81.76 a barrel, respectively.\nAlso dragging on oil was trade data showing China's drop in exports unexpectedly accelerated in October, a sign of flagging overseas demand, while its imports rose. But there was a bright spot for the world's second-biggest economy, as the IMF upgraded its GDP growth forecasts for the country this year and next.\nIn corporate news, WeWork (WE) on Monday filed for bankruptcy after the once most valuable US startup grappled with expensive leases. Its shares have fallen about 98% this year.\nMeanwhile, earnings season continues with reports from Uber (UBER) and Rivian (RIVN) highlighting Tuesday's docket, ahead of the closely watched Disney (DIS) results due Wednesday.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) increased for the seventh consecutive session, extending a win streak as investors banked on the Federal Reserve holding rates steady heading into the end of the year. The S&P rose by nearly 0.3%\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.9%, notching its eighth straight day of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.17% or almost 60 points.\nWall Street has been skeptical about how much Disney (DIS) can charge for a new ESPN streaming service it's planning to launch. But the company's former streaming chief says sports fans will be willing to pay \u2014 even if the price tag is higher than what most platforms currently cost.\n\"People have always paid a lot for sports,\" Kevin Mayer, who now runs Blackstone-backed entertainment startup Candle Media, said at the Yahoo Finance Invest Conference on Tuesday. \"They didn't always know it because back in the day when 95% of this country had paid TV bundles, probably 40% to 50% of the cost of that bundle was sports programming. ... [But] now they can do so explicitly.\"\nHis comments come as Disney's stock has hit multiyear lows and activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing for multiple board seats at the company. The company's parks business is slowing, its linear TV division is declining, and its streaming business is not yet profitable.\nMayer, who is currently serving as a strategic adviser to CEO Bob Iger, said his former boss is \"definitely most focused on making sure that ESPN, a company that he really believes in strongly, is well positioned for the future.\"\nDisney hasn\u2019t disclosed any details regarding pricing for the ESPN service, although analysts have estimated it would need to cost a minimum of around $30 a month in order to break even \u2014 let alone turn a profit.\nMayer, however, insisted that $30 a month is an \"entirely reasonable price to get the full suite of sports that ESPN would offer.\"\nRead more here.\nA substantial drop in inflation that comes without triggering a recession is still a possibility, said Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee.\n\"Over the next couple of months, we might equal the fastest drop in inflation in the last century,\" Goolsbee said Tuesday, during in an interview with CNBC. \"So we're making progress on the inflation rate.\"\nGoolsbee noted that in previous battles against inflation a recession usually followed when central bankers had to greatly reduce pricing pressures. But achieving a soft landing in this tightening cycle would achieve what has not previously been done, he said, because of the magnitude of the inflation drop that would be required.\nHe also noted that if the Fed continues to make progress on the inflation front, the debate will shift from whether to rise rates to how long to keep rates elevated.\nCredit card balances rose by $48 billion in the third quarter to a record high of $1.08 trillion, according to data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The $154 billion year-over-year gain in debt was the largest such increase since the beginning of the series in 1999. At the same time, the 90-day delinquency rate measure for credit cardholders increased to 5.78%, up from 3.69% a year earlier, Yahoo Finance's Gabriella Cruz-Martinez reports.\nRising delinquencies spanned incomes and regions, the data showed, but they were particularly acute among millennials and those with auto or student loans.\nThe fresh data comes as the three-year federal student loan payment pause ended in October and interest rates on credit cards have increased to 38-year highs. The combination has been a blow to some borrowers saddled with credit card debt.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page in afternoon trading on Tuesday:\nIntel (INTC): Shares of the multinational tech company rose 2% Tuesday afternoon following a report from the Wall Street Journal that revealed the company is in the running to potentially receive billions of dollars in government funding for secure facilities producing microchips for US military and intelligence applications.\nARM (ARM): Arm shares rose by more than 3% following reports that Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) are both planning to launch Arm-based central processing units (CPUs) for Windows-based PCs.\nDatadog (DDOG): Shares surged nearly 30% Tuesday afternoon after the security software company beat profit expectations and delivered a positive outlook as more customers transition to the cloud seeking more robust security solutions amid heightened cybersecurity threats.\nPlanet Fitness: (PLNT): Shares of the gym chain climbed more than 12% Tuesday after reporting a nearly 14% increase in total revenue from last year on growth in same-store sales and more than two dozen new clubs.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on track to notch its seventh consecutive day of wins, if it holds on to its gains through the closing bell. The index rose 0.2% in afternoon trading.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by about 0.7%, on target to record its eighth straight day of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just over the flatline.\nStrong showings from corporate America are generally moving stocks upward again.\nThe 710 companies that reported quarterly results last week saw a 2.3% gain in the trading session following their release, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That's one of the best readings in the last 20 years, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports.\nBut it's not the earnings themselves that have changed investor behavior, but rather the shifting narrative that has renewed hopes on Wall Street that the Fed is close to ending its rate hiking campaign.\nAs the current market consensus has shifted over the past several trading sessions, investors appear less worried about the headwinds that drove stocks lower in October. As of late-morning Tuesday, markets were pricing in a 90% chance the Fed holds interest rates steady in December, up significantly from the roughly 58% chance seen a month ago.\nAnthony Capuano, the chief executive of Marriott, said the hotel chain is dedicated to the Middle East market, even as the conflict in Israel and Gaza carries the potential for broader regional instability. \"We've got a robust pipeline across the region,\" Capuano said during a live interview at Yahoo Finance Invest, adding that keeping guests within the hotel ecosystem is a top priority. Marriott has more than two dozen hotels in Lebanon and Egypt.\nCapuano also emphasized the company's growth in China, its second-largest market. The operating environment there, he said, \"is more than fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\" Marriott recently opened its 500th hotel in China, he said, and has plans to open another 400 properties.\nWhile the US and China are grappling with heightened economic and national security tensions, Capuano said his company has been able to stay above the geopolitical fray because Marriott is an asset-light business.\nOf the 500 hotels in Marriott's China portfolio and the hundreds more on the way, most of the properties are \"almost entirely China-owned,\" he said.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page in morning trading on Tuesday:\nDatadog (DDOG): Shares surged 24% Tuesday morning after the security software company beat profit expectations and delivered a positive outlook as more customers transition to the cloud seeking more robust security solutions amid heightened cybersecurity threats.\nPlanet Fitness: (PLNT): Shares of the gym chain climbed more than 15% Tuesday after reporting a nearly 14% increase in total revenue from last year on growth in same-store sales and more than two dozen new clubs.\nWeWork (WORK): Trading on the co-working space provider remains halted as the former high-flying startup is expected to file for bankruptcy after its value plunged from $50 billion. The company warned investors in August that its financial troubles may force the company to shutter, punctuating what has been a disastrous run as a public company. It's last price was below $1.\nPeloton (PTON): The troubled connected fitness company edged up less than 1% Tuesday morning after investors sent the company down more than 5% in premarket trading. The rollercoaster moves came after Deutsche Bank downgraded Peloton to Hold from Buy as it sought clarity on its growth outlook.\nWall Street couldn't keep up the surge that fueled last week's rally, as pessimism over the potential for future rate hikes overtook hopes of an end to the Fed's tightening campaign.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by about 0.3%, continuing on a win-streak path, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged down by 0.06%.

        "text": "\n(Adds details on crypto industry in paragraph 13)\nBy Luc Cohen, Jody Godoy\nNEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on Thursday of stealing from customers of his now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange in one of the biggest financial frauds on record, a verdict that cemented the 31-year-old former billionaire's fall from grace. A 12-member jury in Manhattan federal court convicted Bankman-Fried on all seven counts he faced after a monthlong trial in which prosecutors made the case that he looted $8 billion from the exchange's users out of sheer greed. The verdict came just shy of one year after FTX filed for bankruptcy in a swift corporate meltdown that shocked financial markets and erased his estimated $26 billion personal fortune.\nThe jury reached the verdict after just over four hours of deliberations. Bankman-Fried, who had pleaded not guilty to two counts of fraud and five counts of conspiracy, stood facing the jury with his hands clasped in front of him as the verdict was read. The conviction was a victory for the U.S. Justice Department and Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, who made rooting out corruption in financial markets one of his top priorities.\n\"The crypto industry might be new, the players like Sam Bankman-Fried may be new, but this kind of fraud is as old as time and we have no patience for it,\" Williams told reporters outside the courthouse.\nOnce the darling of the crypto world, Bankman-Fried - who was known for his mop of unkempt curly hair and for wearing shorts and T-shirts rather than business attire - joins the likes of admitted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and \"Wolf of Wall Street\" fraudster Jordan Belfort as notable people convicted of major U.S. financial crimes.\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan set Bankman-Fried's sentencing for March 28, 2024. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate could face decades in prison.\nHis defense lawyer Mark Cohen said in a statement that he was \"disappointed\" but respected the jury's decision.\n\"Mr. Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him,\" he said.\nAfter Kaplan left the courtroom, Cohen put his arm around Bankman-Fried as they spoke at the defense table. As Bankman-Fried was led away by members of the U.S. Marshals service, he turned around and nodded at his parents, the Stanford Law School professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, who were seated in the courtroom audience's front row. Fried looked toward him and crossed her arm across her chest. Bankman-Fried is set to go on trial next March on a second set of charges brought by prosecutors earlier this year, including for alleged foreign bribery and bank fraud conspiracies.\nBANKMAN-FRIED TESTIFIED IN OWN DEFENSE\nBankman-Fried's was the first of several blockbuster cases Williams brought against former high-flying cryptocurrency executives to go to trial. Several crypto companies went bankrupt last year after the prices of bitcoin and other digital assets collapsed following a years-long boom.\nProsecutors argued during the trial that Bankman-Fried siphoned money from FTX to his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, despite proclaiming on social media and in television advertisements that the exchange prioritized the safety of customer funds.\nAlameda used the money to pay its lenders and to make loans to Bankman-Fried and other executives - who in turn made speculative venture investments and donated upwards of $100 million to U.S. political campaigns in a bid to promote cryptocurrency legislation the defendant viewed as favorable to his business, according to prosecutors.\nBankman-Fried took the calculated risk of testifying in his own defense over three days near the close of trial after three former members of his inner circle testified against him. He faced aggressive cross-examination by the prosecution, often avoiding direct answers to the most probing questions.\nHe testified that while he made mistakes running FTX, such as not formulating a risk-management team, he did not steal customer funds. He said he thought Alameda's borrowing from FTX was allowed and did not realize how large its debts had grown until shortly before both companies collapsed.\n\"We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,\" Bankman-Fried testified. \"It turned out basically the opposite of that.\"\n'HE THOUGHT THE RULES DID NOT APPLY'\nProsecutors had a different view.\n\"He didn't bargain for his three loyal deputies taking that stand and telling you the truth: that he was the one with the plan, the motive and the greed to raid FTX customer deposits - billions and billions of dollars - to give himself money, power, influence. He thought the rules did not apply to him. He thought that he could get away with it,\" prosecutor Danielle Sassoon told the jury on Thursday. The jury heard 15 days of testimony. Former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, testifying for the prosecution after entering guilty pleas, said he directed them to commit crimes, including helping Alameda loot FTX and lying to lenders and investors about the companies' finances.\nThe defense argued the three, who have not yet been sentenced, falsely implicated Bankman-Fried in a bid to win leniency at sentencing. Prosecutors may ask Kaplan to take their cooperation into account in deciding their punishment.\nBankman-Fried has been jailed since August after Kaplan revoked his bail, having concluded he likely tampered with witnesses.\n(Reporting by Luc Cohen and Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Will Dunham, Daniel Wallis and Lincoln Feast)",

The Asian and Pacific economic calendar on Thursday is light on quantity but fairly heavy on significance - South Korean inflation and Australian trade are the main indicators, while the policy highlight is the Malaysian central bank's interest rate decision. Investors will also continue to digest the fallout from the Bank of Japan's decision to scrap its 1% ceiling for the 10-year bond yield - on Wednesday the BOJ waded into the bond market, the yen recouped some ground after hitting a one-year low and the Nikkei leaped 2.4% for its third best day of year.\nWednesday's global market action should set the tone for Asia on Thursday. The MSCI World equity index rose just over 1%, its best day since August while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6%, its fourth rise in a row, for its best day since August too.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield plunged 14 basis points, its biggest fall since March.\nWhile Powell kept the door open to further tightening, markets judged he was not quite as hawkish as he might have been. If that is still the prevailing mood in Asia on Thursday, markets across the continent should benefit.\nSentiment toward Chinese markets may be less bullish, however. China's short-term money rates have soared, notably among non-bank financial institutions, and overnight borrowing costs for some Chinese financial institutions have jumped to as high as 50% as a month-end scramble for cash squeezed liquidity and stressed money markets. On the economic front, China's factory activity unexpectedly contracted in October, renewing concerns over the state of the country's fragile economic recovery at the start of the fourth quarter, despite the better-than-expected third-quarter GDP figures a few weeks ago. Uncertainty continues to swirl around the creaking property sector, where developer Evergrande has proposed a new debt restructuring plan for offshore bondholders, offering to swap their debts into about a 30% equity stake in each of the developer's two Hong Kong-listed subsidiaries.\nIn South Korea, figures on Thursday are expected to show annual inflation eased back to 3.60% in October from 3.70%, which would offer some relief to policymakers after it accelerated from July's two-year low of 2.30%.\nMalaysia's central bank is expected to keep its key interest rate at 3% and through 2024, despite a weakening ringgit, amid stable domestic inflation and a steady growth outlook.\nInflation is currently 1.9%, its lowest since March 2021 and far below the government's estimate of 2.5% to 3% for this year, so the central bank has a bit of room to stay on hold, and wait and see.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:\n- Malaysia interest rate decision\n- South Korea CPI inflation (October)\n- Australia trade (October)\n(By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)",

The increase was the most since the final quarter of 2022.\nOverall US household debt grew by $228 billion last quarter to reach $17.3 trillion. The increase was driven by consumers younger than 50, as borrowing by older Americans was little changed. The debt level for those over 50 peaked in the first quarter.\nThe overall increase in debt was largely driven by mortgage, credit card, and student loan balances. Since the pandemic, younger consumers added close to $2.1 trillion in debt while the older Americans added $900 billion. In light of rising interest rates, carrying higher debt loads underscores the financial challenge for consumers under 50.\nThe most indebted households are those between the ages of 40 and 50, while those in their 30s and those in their 50s hold roughly equal amounts of debt. One key difference is that households below age 50 hold $1.2 trillion in student loan debt, compared to about $400 billion for those who are older.\nAuto loan balances rose by $13 billion last quarter, to a record $1.6 trillion. Since 2019, US consumers have added $264 billion in auto loans to their overall debt levels. During the same time, the average interest rate on a four-year auto loan has risen from about 5.5% to 8.3% according to Fed data.\nOver the past four quarters, younger households have originated $436 billion in new auto loans compared with $261 billion for those over age 50.\nSerious delinquencies for auto loans, or loans 90 days or longer past due, are at the highest level since the Great Recession for borrowers in their 20s and 30s.\nCredit-card balances increased by 4.7% last quarter, or by $48 billion, to an overall level of $1.08 trillion. At the same time, credit-card delinquencies have risen \u2014 particularly among younger consumers.\nOverall, 5.8% of credit-card users had unpaid debt that transitioned into serious delinquency status. A year ago, 3.7% of payments were 90 days or more past due.\nTo help those with student loans return to repayment, the Education Department created a temporary on-ramp period through Sept. 30, 2024. This prevents any loan delinquency from being reported to credit agencies for the next year, which may make the true consumer loan repayment status more opaque.\n(Corrects headline, first and second paragraphs, as well as chart to show debt level is at a record, rather than share in story published Nov. 7)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Meanwhile profits at Lloyds of London are booming thanks to rising prices for insuring commercial risks.\n\"The current market backdrop presents an opportunity for a wide range of institutional and retail investors to gain capital efficient liquid access and diversified exposure to the Lloyd's of London insurance market,\" William Allen, CEO of Financials Acquisition Corp, said in a statement.\nLloyd's is made up of more than 50 insurance companies, including three London-listed firms: Beazley, Hiscox and Lancashire.\nSo-called \"names\" - high net worth individuals - also invest in Lloyd's, along with private equity firms and institutional investors.\nSPACs are listed acquisition vehicles that offer target companies a way to list on the stock market without the need for an initial public offering.\nThey typically have a deadline by which a transaction needs to materialise before the vehicle winds down.\nFollowing a frenzy of deals in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, SPACs have lost popularity as they struggled to find businesses to merge with.

Commercial banks have seen their profits soar thanks to the ECB's high interest rates, attracting public criticism and even taxes from governments in Lithuania, Spain and Italy.\nEuro zone governments have only enjoyed part of that bonanza but may foot the full bill if their central bank needs a bailout, as the Dutch National Bank warned it might one day.\nEuro zone commercial banks earn 4.0% on the excess cash they park at their central bank, which is a whopping 3.5 trillion euros after the ECB flooded the system with money over the past decade, when it was trying to boost too-low inflation via massive bond purchases.\nOn the other hand, governments enjoyed rich dividends from their central banks in recent years from the proceeds of those same purchases.\nECB President Christine Lagarde said last week the central bank does \"not have as a purpose to show profits or to cover losses\", adding policymakers had not discussed raising the share of banks' unremunerated reserves.\nBut the issue is plaguing central banks across rich countries. The Swiss National Bank decided on Monday to reduce the amount of interest it pays commercial banks and the Federal Reserve and Bank of England are also posting losses.\n($1 = 0.9472 euros)\n(Additional reporting by Balazs Koranyi and Frank Siebelt; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

        "text": "\nMOTALA, Sweden (AP) \u2014 A new plastics sorting facility inaugurated in Sweden on Wednesday is being billed as the largest of its kind, and one designed to double the amount of plastic packaging materials being recycled in the Nordic country.\nThanks to cutting-edge technology, the Site Zero plant in the central city of Motala can sort up to 200,000 tons of plastic packaging a year, according to Sweden Plastic Recycling, a non-profit company co-owned by Swedish plastics, food and trade industry groups. The company says that\u2019s more than any other sorting facility in the world.\nA unique feature of Site Zero is that it can separate up to 12 different types of plastic.\nAn old plant at the same location could only sort 5 types of plastic, which meant that only 47% of the material was sent on for recycling and the rest was incinerated, said Mattias Philipsson, CEO of Sweden Plastic Recycling.\nThe new plant will be able to send up to 95% of the packaging for recycling, minimizing the amount that is incinerated. Burning plastic has a climate impact by adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere.\nThe world produces more than 430 million tons of plastic annually, two-thirds of which are short-lived products that soon become waste, filling the ocean and, often, working their way into the human food chain, the U.N. Environment Program said in an April report.\nPlastic waste produced globally is set to triple by 2060, with about half ending up in landfill and under one-fifth recycled.\nEfforts to create a landmark treaty to end global plastic pollution are taking place in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, where nations, petrochemical companies, environmentalists and others affected by the pollution are gathered for U.N.-backed negotiations.\nAt Site Zero, the roar of the machines is deafening as conveyor belts carry 40 tons per hour of mixed plastic waste through the entrails of the factory. Gradually, as the chocolate wrappers, plastic bags, yogurt containers or white polystyrene progress across the 60,000 square-meter complex, it\u2019s broken down, separated by size and sorted in a fully automated process reliant on infrared cameras.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game changer,\u201d said \u00c5sa Stenmarck, of the Swedish Environment Protection Agency. \u201cNot just the sorting itself, but that they actually believe there is finally a market\u201d for all 12 types of plastic sorted by the plant.\nRobert Blasiak, a researcher at the Stockholm Resilience Center, said Sweden is \u201cahead of the curve\u201d when it comes to plastics recycling, and that waste management in many other parts of the world has a long way to go.\n\u201cA closed loop for plastics has to be the end goal, really, not just for corporations and governments, but for this U.N. plastics treaty that\u2019s being negotiated now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that means that every stage along the plastic lifecycle, basically the emissions moving through these life stages need to be reduced to zero.\u201d\nOnce sorted, plastic can be recycled in the conventional, mechanical way or via a chemical recycling method, which typically uses heat or chemical solvents to break down plastics into liquid and gas to produce an oil-like mixture or basic chemicals.\nIndustry leaders say that mixture can be made back into plastic pellets to make new products. But environmental groups say that chemical, or advanced, recycling is a distraction from real solutions like producing and using less plastic.\nPhilipsson said that even though the more efficient sorting facility will help raise the amount of plastic being recycled in Sweden, it will also depend on households properly separating their waste.\n\u201cMost plastics are still incinerated because they haven\u2019t been sorted by households,\u201d he said.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",

Online sales in the U.S. during the five-day period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday hit a record $38 billion, according to Adobe Analytics, while the National Retail Federation said more than 200 million people shopped both in-store and online during the holiday weekend, surpassing estimates.\n\"While there are parts of the consumer that definitely are much slower and weaker, from a spending perspective, there's still a lot of money sitting on the sidelines... (The holiday season) actually could be a little bit better than what most people think,\" said Jimmy Lee, CEO of Wealth Consulting Group, which holds Amazon shares.\nEarlier this week, Ulta Beauty and Foot Locker bumped up their annual sales expectations, with the footwear retailer flagging a strong start to holiday selling on the back of steep discounts.\nBlack Friday store visits to recreational and sporting goods retailers were up 322.9% compared to the 2023 year-to-date daily average, while the category saw an increase of 305.2% the previous year, according to foot traffic data from Placer.ai.\n\"We know we're buying for wallet share with a value-conscious consumer this holiday season. Quarter-to-date, we've been pleased with the trends as consumers respond to our full-price holiday assortments in addition to our compelling deals,\" Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon said in a conference call on Wednesday.\nAmazon's extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event - which kicked off on Nov. 17 and continued through Nov. 27 - was its biggest ever compared to the same ending on Cyber Monday in previous years.\nThis year, during the week ending Nov. 25, card spending was 1.7% higher than in the week ending the day after Black Friday last year, according to a report from BofA Global research. The corresponding increases in spending on holiday items were also larger this year, the report said.\nDeep discounts have been a key feature heading into this year's holiday shopping season and holiday discounts could get even bigger in December, according to some retail executives.\nKohl's CEO Tom Kingsbury said last week the company was \"coming out on holiday very aggressively in terms of promotions.\"\nMost retailers including Walmart, and clothing chains Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters , have raised annual forecasts, putting them on track for a strong holiday quarter.\nSince Aug. 1, the consumer discretionary sector has recorded the highest percentage increase in earnings, according to LSEG IBES data.\nYet some retailers, including Kohl's, Best Buy and Lowe's Cos, have tempered their sales forecasts for the year.\n\"The U.S. consumer is bifurcated. Lower income households are pulling back on discretionary purchases... But outside of the lowest tier we believe household consumption remains resilient,\" Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt, said.

The majority of the richest people in the world are entrepreneurs. But there are ways even average wage earners can build equity over time and secure their financial futures.\nHere are a few:\nStocks are the most convenient way to gain exposure to the corporate world. Instead of launching your own business from the ground up, you can buy a piece of a business that has been successful on a global scale for decades.\nSome stocks can deliver jaw-dropping growth. For instance, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has delivered roughly 13,000% in stock-price appreciation over the past 10 years. That\u2019s a decidedly better outcome than what you can expect from most startups and small businesses.\nYou don\u2019t need to pick winners either. Instead, you can buy a fund that tracks the entire stock market to lower your risk. One example is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), which has delivered 11.1% in average annual returns over the last decade.\nReal estate is another entrepreneurial venture. In fact, rental homes are a major part of the country\u2019s economy, contributing $2.4 trillion to the gross domestic product every year. Fortunately, the barriers to entry for this sector are relatively low.\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\nMom-and-pop landlords account for the majority of small rental properties owned by individuals, according to the National Association of Realtors. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans have a minimum required down payment of 3.5%. Meanwhile, average annual gross rental yield on three-bedroom properties was projected to be 7.5%, per an ATTOM report.\nAlternatively, you could invest in a real estate investment trust (REIT) for passive income. For example, Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), owns a portfolio of commercial real estate and offers an attractive 6% dividend yield.\nSide hustles are getting increasingly popular. In a 2022 LendingTree survey, 44% of Americans said they have one \u2014 up 13% from 2020. They made $473 a month, on average, this way, which was almost $5,700 a year.\nThrough the power of the internet, it\u2019s easier than ever to launch such a venture and supplement your regular income. Freelance writing, consulting, babysitting or online ecommerce are some examples of easy-to-start side hustles.\nA successful side hustle can even unlock a massive windfall. According to a CNBC report, two friends invested less than $200 to start their tech-enabled side hustle and recently sold it for over $150,000. Stories like these are increasingly common as the digital economy delivers more opportunities than ever before.\nSuper-rich Americans are snatching up prime real estate abroad as US housing slumps \u2014 but here's a sharp way to invest without having to move overseas\nHere's how much the typical baby boomer has saved for retirement \u2014 how do you stack up right now?\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe \u2014 you may want to do the same in 2024\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Users of Venmo, Cash App and other payment apps will get a tax reprieve this year. The IRS announced Tuesday it will delay implementing new reporting requirements that were to take effect for the coming tax filing season.\nOriginally, app users who made $600 or more selling goods and services would have been required to report those transactions to the IRS, a new threshold required by the American Rescue Plan passed in March 2021.\nInstead, payment apps and online marketplaces will send out separate tax forms \u2014 called 1099-K documents \u2014 for taxpayers who receive over $20,000 and make over 200 transactions selling goods or services.\nFor 2024, the basic reporting threshold will be increased from $600 to $5,000, the IRS said.\nIRS officials say one reason for the delay is taxpayer confusion over what sorts of transaction are reportable.\nFor instance, peer-to-peer transactions, like selling a couch or car, sending rent to a roommate, and buying concert tickets would not be reportable, whereas other purchases would apply.\n\u201cTaking this phased-in approach is the right thing to do for the purposes of tax administration, and it prevents unnecessary confusion,\u201d IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that an additional delay for tax year 2023 will avoid problems for taxpayers, tax professionals and others in this area.\u201d\nThis new requirement was delayed last year as well.\n\u201cWe spent many months gathering feedback from third-party groups and others, and it became increasingly clear we need additional time to effectively implement the new reporting requirements,\u201d said Werfel.\nA provision in the American Rescue Plan requires users to report transactions through payment apps including Venmo, Cash App and others for goods and services meeting or exceeding $600 in a calendar year. Before that provision \u2014 and now for this year \u2014 the reporting requirement applied only to the sale of goods and services to taxpayers who receive over $20,000 and have over 200 transactions.\nLawmakers across the aisle celebrated the delay.\nDemocratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who last week sent a letter to the IRS calling for a delay of the reporting requirement, said \u201cI\u2019m glad to see the IRS heard my concerns and I\u2019ll continue to fight back against burdensome bureaucratic policies.\"\nRepublican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri said the delay showcases a flaw in the provision in the American Rescue Plan, which passed on near party lines. \u201cGiven that even Democrats now admit that this law is unworkable and are trying to rewrite a key provision, it\u2019s time to scrap it and start over,\u201d Smith said.",

Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord\nRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n'A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency \u2014 3 ways you can prepare\n\u201cThere is no denying how difficult it\u2019s become to purchase a home in America today, especially for first-time buyers,\u201d said Aniva Hinduja, general manager of home and mortgage at Credit Karma, in a press release.\n\u201cWhen a majority of potential home buyers are wishing for a recession so they can afford a mortgage, you know the situation is dire.\u201d\nAlthough prospective buyers are feeling desperate, a recession could bring other changes to the economy that could potentially impede homeownership as well.\nIt\u2019s clear that the current housing market is keeping the white-picket-fence dream out of reach of many Americans.\nRoughly 82% of respondents in the Credit Karma survey conducted by The Harris Poll say the country is grappling with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d housing affordability crisis, and another 3 in 5 who\u2019ve never bought a home don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever be able to do so.\nBut is a recession really part of the answer?\nWhile the Fed\u2019s been raising interest rates to combat persistent inflation, in a recession, the opposite usually occurs to encourage more spending.\nAnd when interest rates fall, you can expect mortgage rates to follow \u2014 meaning buyers may be able to secure mortgages with cheaper monthly payments.\nBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily increase the availability of homes for sale, which has been quite low for a while. And with lower supply, you can expect prices to stay high as well.\nThe National Association of Realtors (NAR) expects house prices to rise 2.6% next year.\n\u201cThere are simply not enough homes for sale,\u201d Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said this summer. \u201cThe market can easily absorb a doubling of inventory.\u201d\nThat said, Yun also believes any \u201cmeaningful decline\u201d in mortgage rates could still lead to more buyers, and the NAR forecasts existing home sales could climb 15.5% next year.\nIt\u2019s also crucial to keep in mind that during a recession, employment typically goes through a slump as well. In that case, you can reasonably can expect more layoffs and pay cuts which could mean some hopeful buyers might not be able to afford or even secure a mortgage.\nRead more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate \u2014 without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how\nSome Americans are still taking a chance in the current housing market, with plans to purchase in the next three years. But they\u2019re going to have to get creative in order to afford a home.\nAccording to the survey, nearly 2 in 5 respondents say they\u2019d be willing to take on a side gig or restrict or stop spending on non-essential purchases if it would improve their chances.\nSome say they\u2019d lock in a mortgage at a higher rate, in hopes they can refinance later if rates go down, and others are considering getting an adjustable rate mortgage instead \u2014 which usually comes with a lower rate, but resets periodically depending on a certain economic benchmarks like the Fed rate.\nA few are even moving in with their family or friends for the time being to build up savings, or are putting important life events, like getting married or having kids on hold.\nThere are other options when it comes to investing in real estate without buying a physical property as well.\nFor example, you could buy shares in rental homes and vacation rentals for a much smaller minimum investment, compared to purchasing a home.\nOr you could look into commercial real estate and own shares of institutional-quality properties leased by major retailers.\nWorried about the economy?

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank officials keep insisting that interest rates need to stay high, but another stark slowdown in inflation suggests the economic picture is changing faster than they expected.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBanking Escapees Make Billions From Private Credit Boom\nTesla\u2019s Cheapest Cybertruck Will Cost $60,990 and Be Available in 2025\nThese Are the World's Most Expensive Cities to Live In Right Now\nSaudi Arabia Offers Iran Investment to Blunt Gaza War\nBiggest Blowout in Bonds Since the 1980s Sparks Everything Rally\nIn three consecutive months, consumer-price growth has weakened more than economists predicted, and the outcome of 2.4% for November published on Thursday was closer to the ECB\u2019s target than at any point since mid-2021. As recently as August, inflation was more than twice as fast.\nInvestors who were already betting on a reduction in borrowing costs as soon as April are now even surer, despite hawkish policymakers claiming no such move is in the offing. Traders shrugged last week when one official, Pierre Wunsch, even threatened that a hike could be needed to convince them.\nInflation is getting tantalizingly close to the 2% goal of the Frankfurt-based ECB, and recent outcomes now make it increasingly likely that its staff will have to lower a forecast that previously envisaged price growth at the target only in the second half of 2025.\nThose projections will be released in just two weeks, when the ECB is widely expected to leave borrowing costs on hold for a second meeting and where President Christine Lagarde will face mounting scrutiny over her insistence on holding rates high as the economy languishes.\n\u201cWhen the ECB realizes at the beginning of next year that inflation is going down significantly faster than expected, talk about rate cuts is going to intensify,\u201d said Joerg Angele, an economist at Bantleon in Zurich who was one of those closest to predicting November\u2019s inflation retreat. \u201cThat would be reasonable, because if economic activity remains weak, I don\u2019t see any reason not to lower interest rates to a neutral level.\u201d\nHe sees the recent inflation outcome emboldening dovish policymakers who spent the past 18 months on the back foot as hawkish ECB colleagues set the tone to drive an aggressive series of 10 back-to-back rate hikes.\nOne of them, newly appointed Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta, was quick to start the ball rolling. With inflation in his own country now a paltry 0.7%, he warned colleagues that rate hikes are proving more effective than anticipated.\n\u201cDisinflation is well under way,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cWe need to avoid unnecessary damage to economic activity and risks to financial stability, which would ultimately jeopardize price stability.\u201d\nWhile the ECB\u2019s price outlook is looking increasingly pessimistic, the Dec. 14 gathering may come too soon for a significant change in tone, not least for a central bank whose footwork has often been ponderous. By the time officials began raising rates in July 2022, most global counterparts had begun already.\nBut ECB officials also have reason for caution. They anticipate inflation should pick up again in December because of statistical effects making the comparison to last year less favorable.\nThe removal of some of the aid measures governments introduced to soften the energy-price spike after the Ukraine war will also stand in the way of a further rapid decline. In Germany, for example, temporary tax breaks for restaurant meals are ending in January.\n\u201cWe know that November is the trough,\u201d Janet Henry, chief global economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, told Bloomberg Television. \u201cHeadline inflation is probably \u2014 just given the base effects \u2014 going to start rising again.\u201d\nCore inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as energy and is the key measure policymakers have focused on, is also still higher than the headline measure, at 3.6%.\nSuch factors may give hawkish officials sufficient cover to stick to the message that borrowing costs need to restrict the economy for longer to stamp out inflation. Even after Thursday\u2019s data, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel \u2014 a leading hawk \u2014 stuck to his guns.\n\u201cThe inflation risks are skewed to the upside \u2014 not least due to the current geopolitical situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t rule out a further increase in interest rates. At the same time, it seems to me to be far too early to even think about a possible interest-rate cut.\u201d\n\u201cA cut in the first meeting of next year is hard to see because headline inflation is going to go up, and the optics matter,\u201d said Kamil Kovar, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cBut in March, it\u2019s feasible to have a cut. It\u2019ll require further weak reports, but it\u2019s feasible.\u201d\nInvestors now see an almost 50% chance that this scenario will play out, with a cut in April fully priced in. Just over a month ago, the expectation was for a first reduction in June.\nHelping such speculation is an economy that also seems to be performing worse than expected. French output contracted in the third quarter, according to revised data on Thursday, and private-sector activity in the euro area has continued to shrink this month.\nSome caution that despite Thursday\u2019s figure, risks to the inflation outlook can\u2019t be dismissed. A key question is whether companies will be able to pass on rising wages to consumers, and how wages will respond.\n\u201cRemember: inflation has been above target for over 2 1/2 years \u2014 they know which way the risks are still skewed,\u201d HSBC\u2019s Henry said, referring to the ECB. \u201cFor now, inflation is still too high, even if moving in the right direction.\u201d\nA forecast confirming inflation dropping back to target next year may change that, especially given the euro-zone\u2019s history of too-low price growth before the pandemic, according to Kovar at Moody\u2019s.\n\u201cIf you have that in the forecast, it\u2019s kind of hard to say we will just stick to a 4% deposit rate because we like it here,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some level, the memory of the last decade will also start to play a role.\u201d\n--With assistance from Kamil Kowalcze.\n(Updates with Nagel in 15th paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

They underestimated you.\"\nThe union officially suspended its strike against the Detroit Three. UAW local leaders will come to Detroit on Friday to consider the deal with GM, before taking terms to all union workers for ratification.\n\"We are looking forward to having everyone back to work across all of our operations,\" said GM CEO Mary Barra.\nThe new contracts will significantly raise costs for the automakers. The companies and some analysts have said the deals will make it harder for the Detroit Three to compete with electric-vehicle leader Tesla and nonunion foreign brands such as Toyota Motor.\nThe UAW won from GM roughly the same package of wage increases agreed with the other two automakers. Pay for veteran workers will rise by 33% and GM will give $2,500 in five payments to retirees through 2028.\nSources have said pension benefits were a sticking point in the UAW's negotiations with GM, which has more retirees than Ford or Stellantis.\nFain said the union's move on Saturday to strike a key GM engine factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, \"landed the knockout blow\" that got the deal.\nThe contract reverses years of efforts by GM to create lower-paid groups of UAW workers at units such as component plants, parts warehouses and electric vehicle battery operations. It puts workers at GM's battery joint-venture with South Korea's LG Energy under the national agreement.\nFain said some workers at GM's component operations will get pay increases of as much as 89%.\nThe contract also restricts use of lower paid temporary workers. \"We have slammed the door on having a permanent underclass of temporary workers at GM,\" Fain said.\nThe UAW also gained more sway over the companies' investment decisions by securing the right to strike over future plant closures.\nAll three companies have said they do not plan to close existing factories as they shift to EVs. Yet the contract could force them to keep unprofitable plants open during a recession or period of slow sales for new models.\nHIGHER COSTS\nA series of walkouts began on Sept. 15, and nearly 50,000 workers out of nearly 150,000 UAW members at the Detroit automakers eventually joined. The strategy of escalating strikes cost the Detroit Three and suppliers billions of dollars.\nUAW leaders called their contract fight part of a larger movement to reverse decades of economic setbacks for working-class Americans. Some analysts agreed.\n\"This is more than an auto industry story; it is a signal to the entire country that unionized workers can demand and get big wage increases,\" said Patrick Anderson of the Anderson Economic Group.\nThe new contract will cost GM $7 billion over 4.5 years in higher labor costs, two sources told Reuters. Ford said last week it would add $850 to $900 per vehicle in labor costs.\n\"Consumers will bear some of the cost burden over time ... automakers will not have an easy time passing along all of the costs ... and will have to seek efficiencies in other ways, or further limit production to more expensive vehicles that can absorb higher labor costs,\" Cox Automotive's chief economist, Jonathan Smoke, said.\nPRAISE FROM BIDEN\nU.S. President Joe Biden and politicians from both parties weighed in to support the UAW as the union's fight gained popularity with voters. Michigan will again be a crucial swing state in the 2024 presidential election, and Fain made support for the union's fight a condition of winning his endorsement. The UAW still has not formally endorsed Biden's re-election.\n\"This historic contract is a testament to the power of unions and collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping our most iconic American companies thrive,\" Biden said in a statement. His aides had worried that a prolonged strike would damage the U.S. economy and the Democratic president's chances of re-election in 2024.\nThe UAW has said it is committed to organizing workforces at other carmakers, making negotiations in 2028 between the union and the \"Big Five or Big Six.\"\nMomentum toward deals accelerated over the past two weeks after UAW workers walked out at three of the most profitable factories in the world. The UAW eventually struck against nine plants.\n\"We have shown the companies, the American public and the whole world that the working class is not done fighting\" Fain said. \"In fact, we're just getting started.\"\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Joseph White in Detroit Additional reporting by Shivansh Tiwary, Kannaki Deka and Richard Francis in Bengaluru Writing by Deepa Babington and Sayantani Ghosh Editing by David Gaffen, Alistair Bell, Peter Henderson, Matthew Lewis and David Gregorio)",

        "text": "\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 This summer, Daniel Goldstein\u2019s 86-year-old mom got an email that looked like it was from her bank. She was alarmed because she hadn\u2019t spent the money it mentioned, so she called a help number on the email. The person on the other end of the line asked for her bank account information and made her believe she would get her money back. Instead, she lost $600 to a scammer.\nLast year, consumers of all ages were scammed out of $8.8 billion. And older adults lost the most money compared to other age groups, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\nWhile everyone wants to protect their parents and grandparents from scammers, sometimes these conversations can be complicated to navigate.\n\u201cWe encourage people to think in multigenerational approaches. Everyone is getting scammed, it\u2019s just a different way that scammers go after you,\u201d said Genevieve Waterman from the National Council on Aging.\nFrom having a lot of empathy to knowing how to report a scam, experts shared their recommendations for talking about scams:\nKNOW WHICH SCAMS COMMONLY TARGET OLDER PEOPLE\nKnowing which scams are most commonly used to target older people can help.\nTwo of the most common are the \u201cgrandparent\u201d scam and romance scams, said Kathy Stokes, director of fraud prevention at AARP.\nThe grandparent scam is when someone gets a phone call from a person impersonating a grandchild and asking for money to get them out of trouble. The first step to avoid this is to call other family members before taking any action, the FTC recommends.\nWhen it comes to romance scams, the FTC reported that people lost $1.3 billion in 2022. Scammers usually contact people through social media and then move the conversation to other messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Google Chat.\n\u201cA lot of older adults are now going into the online dating world, they\u2019re making a lot of online conversations, having a lot of dates, but that leads them to scammers who are then convincing them to give them money and send it overseas,\u201d Waterman said.\nWhat starts as a simple conversation turns into a sudden romantic connection. But then the person asks for money because something happened in their lives and they need help. According to the FTC, common lies by scammers include \u201cI or someone close to me is sick, hurt, or in jail\u201d and \u201cI can teach you how to invest.\u201d\nOther common scams are investment scams, tech support scams, and impersonation scams. You can read more about these on the FTC\u2019s website.\nHAVE CONSTANT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SCAMS\nOne of the best ways to raise awareness about scams is to talk to each other about them. To keep your older family members safe, Waterman recommends that families talk about scams more often in their day-to-day lives.\n\u201cI love the idea of sitting around the table and talking about (scams) and making it more common,\u201d Waterman said.\nGoldstein said his mom knows how to use technology fairly well and they've had many conversations about email scams. However, she had never encountered the type of scam she was targeted by over the summer.\nBecause she felt a sense of urgency, she didn\u2019t contact her son before calling the scammer. Goldstein believes that could have prevented her from losing money.\nIt\u2019s a common practice for scammers to make victims feel like they need to act right away, which makes them more vulnerable to falling for a story that might not seem plausible if they weren\u2019t under pressure. If you\u2019re having a conversation about scams with your family members, it\u2019s important to highlight the rushing aspect of scam practices.\nINFORM, DON\u2019T IMPOSE\nWhen you are navigating complicated conversations, it's better to take an informative approach rather than an authoritative tone. Because your parents or grandparents have a lot of expertise in other life topics, if you approach a conversation by imposing your ideas, it might not have the best effect.\nWhen Stokes has conversations with her mom about scams, she approaches the conversation by saying that she heard about a new type of scam and asks questions such as \u201cWhat do you think about this?\u201d instead of using language like \u201cHey mom, there\u2019s this scam, don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d\nWaterman also recommends that you have conversations as a family, including younger members of your family, and make sure you make it clear that scams target everyone regardless of age.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about staying vigilant together as a family unit and not to challenge that older adult but just to explain that (scams) are becoming more sophisticated,\u201d Waterman said.\nIf you\u2019re looking for guides to avoid scams for older adults, you can find a variety of them on the National Council on Aging\u2019s website.\nBE EMPATHETIC IF THEY FALL FOR A SCAM\nIf your family member has already lost money to a scam, Stokes recommends that you approach the conversation with a lot of empathy.\n\u201cWe tend to blame the victim,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cWhen you are faced with another adult in your life who has experienced a scam loss, understand that it\u2019s a crime.\u201d\nStokes encourages people to think about scammers as organized groups with many resources, rather than a random person calling from their mom\u2019s basement. Stokes says that people should think of these crimes at the same level as others and therefore have empathy for the victims.\nDISCUSS A PLAN IN CASE THEY ENCOUNTER A SCAMMER\nA few days after the scam took place, Goldstein\u2019s mom told him about it.\n\u201cShe was really unhappy and I\u2019m like \u2018Mom, why didn\u2019t you call me?\u2019\u201d said Goldstein, who felt frustrated by the situation.\nPart of Goldstein\u2019s frustration came from the fact that he had a system with his mom where she would call him if she ever felt like something was wrong. However, he also felt bad for his mom because she was embarrassed that she was a victim.\nWhile being online is now part of most people\u2019s lives, older adults have a harder time adapting to some aspects of the internet, which can make them more vulnerable, Waterman said.\n\u201cOlder adults have been thrown into the virtual world during COVID without any digital literacy training or navigation in general,\u201d Waterman said.\nTo combat the anxiety and provide information about scams, the AARP has a Fraud Watch Network Helpline. This helpline guides people worried about being scammed or emotional support for those who have experienced fraud.\nTEACH FAMILY MEMBERS HOW TO REPORT A SCAM\nIf you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it's good practice to report it. You can report a scam on the FTC's website.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Cherney and Akash Sriram\n(Reuters) -Google-parent Alphabet's cloud business crawled to its slowest in at least 11 quarters, sending the company's stock down 5.7% after hours, even as sales at rival Microsoft's cloud unit boomed.\nThe drop in Google\u2019s share price despite beating Wall Street estimates for profit and sales, shows how much investors want the company to deliver gains in artificial intelligence, and show the cloud business remains competitive against a more powerful Azure from Microsoft and Amazon.com\u2019s AWS.\nFears of a slowing global economy have prompted companies to curb spending on cloud-related services, including expensive AI tools, which has slowed revenue growth at Google's cloud unit to 22.5% in the third quarter, from 28% in the prior three-month period.\nGoogle Cloud third-quarter revenue rose 22.5% to $8.41 billion, the slowest growth since at least the first quarter of 2021. The cloud unit reported a operating income of $266 million, compared with an operating loss of $440 million a year ago. Wall Street expected cloud computing revenue of $8.62 billion.\nFinance chief Ruth Porat said in a conference call Tuesday that the third-quarter cloud growth is due to \"customer optimization efforts,\" without elaborating.\nBy contrast, revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses the Azure cloud computing platform, grew to $24.3 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $23.49 billion, LSEG data showed. Azure revenue rose 29%, higher than a 26.2% growth estimate from market research firm Visible Alpha. Microsoft shares rose 5% after hours.\n\"Despite Alphabet topping quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, investors were disappointed by the relatively weak performance at its Google cloud platform, which is at risk of falling further behind Azure and AWS,\" Investing.com senior analyst Jesse Cohen.\nWhile advertising spending has been strong in some sectors such as retail and travel, industry executives and analysts have noted a pullback in budgets in some areas, affecting Alphabet's major source of revenue.\nThe company recorded ad revenue of $59.65 billion in the third quarter, compared with $54.48 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $59.12 billion in revenue from its advertising business. Within the company's advertising segment, YouTube ads reported revenue of $7.95 billion compared with $7.07 billion last year.\nAlphabet reported a net profit of $19.69 billion for the July-Sept. period, compared with $13.91 billion a year earlier.\nRevenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 stood at $76.69 billion, compared with estimates of $75.97 billion, according to LSEG data.\nGoogle said it spent $8.06 billion on capital expenses in the third quarter that was \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d the result of investments in its technical infrastructure. Servers were the largest component, followed by data centers due to a significant increase in AI computing investments, Porat said.\nAlphabet laid off roughly than 12,000 employees earlier this year, or about 6% of its global workforce, in an effort to cut staff amid a \"different economic reality.\" The company also laid off employees from its global recruiting team in September.\nThe company disclosed that it recorded severance and related charges of $2.1 billion for the first nine months of the year.\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Max A.

        "text": "\nParamount (PARA) reported third quarter results on Thursday that came in mostly ahead of estimates as streaming losses significantly improved.\nParamount reported a direct-to-consumer (DTC) loss of $238 million, narrower than analyst expectations of $438 million and the $343 million loss seen in the year-earlier period. The company reported a $424 million loss in the second quarter.\nThe company now forecasts full-year direct-to-consumer losses in 2023 will be lower than in 2022, with anticipated fourth-quarter DTC losses similar to the year-ago period.\n\"We continue to execute our strategy and prioritize prudent investment in streaming while maximizing the earnings of our traditional business,\" Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said in the release.\n\"In Q3, we successfully grew direct-to-consumer revenue and Paramount+ subscribers while narrowing DTC losses over 30%. In fact, we now expect DTC losses in 2023 will be lower than in 2022 \u2014 meaning streaming investment peaked ahead of plan. Looking ahead, we remain on the path to achieving significant total company earnings growth in 2024,\" he continued.\nParamount shares surged as much as 10% in after-hours trading following the results.\n\nParamount posted revenue of $7.13 billion \u2014 a 3% year-over-year increase, but a slight miss compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates of $7.15 billion.\nAdjusted earnings per share, however, beat expectations of $0.10 to come in at $0.30 \u2014 a 23% increase from the year-ago period.\nParamount+ added 2.7 million subscribers in the quarter, beating expectations of a 1.8 million increase. In total, Paramount+ has reached more than 63 million subscribers.\nSubscription revenue also grew 46% in the quarter to reach $1.3 billion, driven by subscriber growth and pricing increases for Paramount+, coupled with revenue from pay-per-view events. Overall direct-to-consumer revenue totaled $1.69 billion in the quarter, compared to the expected $1.64 billion.\nThe difficult TV ad market, however, continued to be a headwind with linear ad revenue slumping 14% year-over-year, worse than the 12% drop expected and also worse than the 10% year-over-year slump seen in the second quarter.\nThe company said the drop reflects \"continued softness in the global advertising market and lower political advertising.\"\nLicensing and other revenue decreased 12%, driven by lower revenue from original content produced for third parties. Content available for licensing was impacted by temporary production shutdowns as a result of labor strikes.\nParamount recently delayed the theatrical release of \"Mission Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part Two\" to May 2025 from June 2024 amid the ongoing actors strike.\nStill, filmed entertainment revenue beat estimates in the quarter to hit $891 million, representing a 14% year-over-year increase. The segment was aided by the extensions of multiple franchises like \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One,\" \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,\" and \"PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie.\"\nLooking ahead, the company has consistently reiterated a return to positive free cash flow and earnings growth in 2024, aided by recent price hikes of its streaming tiers following the Paramount+ with Showtime integration, layoffs, business restructurings, and a dividend cut announced in May.\nParamount has committed to divesting non-core assets as it works to pare down debt and improve its balance sheet.\nLast quarter, the company announced it sold Simon & Schuster to investment firm KKR after the publishing giant's sale to Penguin Random House collapsed late last year. The $1.62 billion, all-cash deal was completed on Monday.\nIts strong slate of assets suggests more M&A activity to come. Showtime and BET Media Group have been two assets recently entangled in sales rumors.\nParamount has long been viewed as a potential acquisition target due to its small size relative to competitors. The company boasts a current market cap of just under $8 billion, compared to Disney's (DIS) $152 billion and Netflix's (NFLX) $186 billion.\nParamount CEO Bob Bakish hinted more media M&A was on the horizon while speaking at a UBS media conference late last year.\n\"Consolidation has been the rule in business for a long time, certainly been the rule in media,\" he said at the time. \"So, it\u2019s hard for me to bet on anything other than consolidation will happen in the future.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

It didn't come, so there's been a bit of a relief rally,\" said analyst Neil Glynn of AIR Control Tower.\nEurope's airlines have reported record quarterly profits as consumers have kept travelling despite a cost of living crisis, but the outlook has been clouded by rising oil prices due to the conflict in the Middle East and risks of recession.\nLufthansa reported third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 1.47 billion euros ($1.56 billion), up 31% year-on-year and slightly above average expectations for 1.43 billion in an analyst consensus published by the company.\n\"Even though the geopolitical situation remains challenging, our booking outlook gives us reason to be positive - not only for a very good group result this year, but also beyond,\" Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said.\nLufthansa shares were set for their biggest daily gain since June 2022, according to Eikon data, in the wake of the earnings announcement. Shares had fallen to a one-year low on Wednesday.\nOUTLOOK\nDemand for both short-haul and long-haul flights remained high, especially among leisure travellers, Lufthansa said, and the trend towards more bookings in pricey premium classes continued.\nCosts were 0.9% lower than the same quarter last year despite rising inflation with the expectation of a similar result in the fourth quarter and a decline of unit cost next year.\nBecause of the falling costs and higher flight demand, the group expects to post a positive operating result for the fourth quarter, helping it achieve its aim of an adjusted group EBIT of more than 2.6 billion euros for the full year 2023.\nNext year, Lufthansa expects the amount of seating capacity available to passengers to increase further to around 95% of pre-pandemic levels. Globally capacity will remain restricted because of supply chain problems, bolstering ticket prices, Spohr said on an analyst call.\n\"We continue to see a more cautious pace of capacity restoration at Lufthansa vs other European peers ... likely a sensible move given the increasingly permanent-looking impairment in the key corporate segment,\" said Bernstein analyst Alex Irving in a note.\n($1 = 0.9438 euros)\n(Reporting by Maria Sheahan, Ilona Wissenbach and Joanna Plucinska; Editing by Kirsti Knolle, Christian Schmollinger and Sonali Paul)",

A break for corporate investment will be made permanent, costing \u00a311 billion, in a move that was widely applauded by business. Labour signaled it\u2019s likely to keep both plans.\nDespite saying the measures amounted to \u201cthe biggest package of tax cuts to be implemented since the 1980s,\u201d the tax burden remained at a post-World War II high of 37.7% of GDP. That\u2019s due to pre-existing policies, which will freeze income tax thresholds until 2028.\n\u201cThe cuts are dwarfed by \u00a345 billion of already announced threshold freezes,\u201d Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said. Had Hunt not cut taxes, the tax burden would have hit 38.4%, the OBR said.\nFor all Hunt\u2019s talk of growth, it was not a thriving economy but inflation that came to his rescue. While Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been trying to defeat inflation all year, rising prices boosted tax revenue to the Treasury, giving Hunt room for maneuver.\nTrend growth, which determines living standards, was downgraded by a total of 2.4% between 2023 and 2027 but the cash size of the economy, which includes inflation effects, was upgraded by 5.5%. \u201cTaxes aren\u2019t being cut because inflation has fallen,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThey\u2019re being cut because inflation has been higher than expected.\u201d\nThe result was \u00a330 billion of headroom against his fiscal rule that debt must be falling as a share of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast. Hunt used all but \u00a313 billion of it but half is expected to be used to scrap fuel duty in March, leaving him with the same \u00a36.5 billion of fiscal space at the budget he had eight months ago.\nAlongside full expensing and the NICs cuts, Hunt hopes to lift the economy by leveraging private capital through pension fund reforms, clearing obstacles in the planning system and ensuring work pays by getting tough on benefits while lifting the minimum wage.\nThe OBR judged the package will claw back 0.3% of lost growth by 2028. Full-expensing lifts business investment by \u00a320 billion at the end of the forecast, it said, while the NICs cut and benefits reforms boost labor supply by 78,000.\nThe quest for stronger growth and low taxes unites both parties. Hunt\u2019s plan to turbo-charge the economy and give households some of their money back is little different to his opposite number, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves.\nShe has attacked the 25 tax rises since Sunak became chancellor in 2021 and accused Hunt of \u201cpicking the pockets of working people.\u201d She told reporters earlier this month: \u201cIt is because this is a government of low growth that it is a government of high taxes.\u201d\nHunt left little doubt that the Autumn Statement teed the Conservatives up for an election in 2024, but he faces a difficult backdrop.\nInflation has more than halved, meeting Sunak\u2019s target for the year, but remains the highest in the Group of Seven nations. The OBR warned consumer prices will be stickier than thought and not return to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target until early 2025.\nHouseholds are in the midst of the steepest fall in living standards since the 1950s, the OBR said. While the outlook has improved since March, real household disposable income is on track to have fallen 3.5% between 2020 and 2025.\nAnd markets also raised concerns about the glut of gilts to pay for the \u00a393 billion six-year stimulus. The yield on 30-year government bonds rose 10 basis points as traders adjusted to the bigger-than-expected debt issuance plans.\nEven so, Hunt has some short-term giveaways for the election year, including \u00a32.65 billion of business rates relief for retail and hospitality firms, \u00a3270 million for regional investment in 2024, and a one year freeze in alcohol duties.\nFor poorer households there was help, too. Benefits will rise 6.7% to provide \u201cvital support for those on the very lowest incomes,\u201d Hunt said. The state pension will increase 8.5% and the minimum wage is rising 10%.\nThe choice that Hunt mapped out was low-tax, private sector-led growth with the Tories or big-state interventionism with Labour and its \u00a328 billion green investment plan.\nLabour\u2019s Reeves said households are paying the price of for 13 years of Tory rule. \u201cNothing that has been announced today will remotely compensate rising mortgages, rising taxes eating into wages, inflation high with prices still going up in the shops, public services on their knees, and too many families struggling to make ends meet,\u201d she said in Parliament.\n--With assistance from Andrew Atkinson and Greg Ritchie.\n(Updates with Hunt comment in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

That's the downside,\" said Greg Bassuk, chief executive officer at AXS Investments.\n\"On the positive side, investors have seen strong earnings and a resilient economy. So all eyes are focused on any other economic data or Fed comments that could give better feedback regarding the direction of both the economy and the markets going forward.\"\nSupporting equities on Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note eased to 4.6043%.\nMegacap growth stocks traded higher, with Nvidia, Tesla and Apple up between 0.5% and 1.4%.\nInformation technology, up 0.9% led sectoral gains, with nine out off 11 major S&P 500 sectors on the upside.\nTraders are now pricing in an about 68% chance of a rate cut by the Fed at the June meeting, compared with bets of a cut in May before Powell spoke, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nWhile this week has been light in terms of economic data, investors will get reports on consumer and producer prices as well as retail sales next week, which will further shape interest rate expectations ahead of the Fed's December meeting.\nAt 10:02 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 50.32 points, or 0.15%, at 33,942.26, the S&P 500 was up 12.72 points, or 0.29%, at 4,360.07, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 74.72 points, or 0.55%, at 13,596.17.\nAmong other stocks, gaming software maker Unity Software fell 2.7% on missing third-quarter revenue estimates.\nPlug Power plunged 34.1% after the hydrogen fuelcell maker raised going concern doubts.\nIllumina shares dropped 14.1% as the gene-testing company trimmed its full-year profit forecast for the second straight quarter.\nThe S&P 500 health sub-index fell 0.6%.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.74-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.16-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 14 new 52-week highs and lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 171 new lows.

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in October amid lower gasoline prices, and underlying inflation showed signs of slowing, supporting views that the Federal Reserve was probably done raising interest rates.\nThe unchanged reading in the consumer price index reported by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Tuesday followed a 0.4% rise in September.\nIn the 12 months through October, the CPI climbed 3.2% after rising 3.7% in September.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.1% on the month and increasing 3.3% on a year-on-year basis.\nThough year-on-year consumer prices have come down from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, the disinflationary trend has stalled somewhat against the backdrop of a strong economy that is being powered by a relatively tight labor market. Inflation is running above the Fed's 2% target.\nFinancial markets and most economists believe that the U.S. central bank's monetary policy tightening campaign is over, a narrative that Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have pushed back against. Powell said last week that \"if it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so.\" Since March 2022, the Fed has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% band.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.2% amid higher costs for rental housing. The so-called core CPI had risen by 0.3% for two months.\nWith the October release, the BLS implemented changes to the methodology it uses to calculate health insurance prices, which boosted costs.\nThe old method was based on an annual calculation using aggregated health insurance premium and benefit data. There were concerns about the volatility in the annual data and the lag involved in incorporating the health insurance financial data.\nThe new method introduces smoothing to the health insurance index to reduce the volatility and also incorporates semiannual financial data, which will shorten the lag in the index by six months. The BLS will update retained earnings every six months using half-year data and will calculate a two-year moving average to smooth the changes in retained earnings.\nThe core CPI advanced 4.0% on a year-on-year basis in October after increasing 4.1% in September.

        "date": "2023-11-03T00:43:04.000Z",
        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The nation\u2019s employers slowed their hiring in October, adding a modest but still decent 150,000 jobs, a sign that the labor market may be cooling but remains resilient despite high interest rates that have made borrowing much costlier for companies and consumers.\nLast month\u2019s job growth, though down sharply from a robust 297,000 gain in September, was solid enough to suggest that many companies still want to hire and that the economy remains sturdy. And job growth would have been higher in October if not for the now-settled United Auto Workers\u2019 strikes. The strikes ended this week with tentative settlements in which against Detroit\u2019s automakers granted significantly better pay and benefits to the union\u2019s workers.\nFriday\u2019s jobs report from the government comes as the Federal Reserve is assessing incoming economic data to determine whether to leave its key interest rate unchanged, as it did this week, or to raise it again in its drive to curb inflation. The lower job growth in October, along with a slowdown in pay gains last month, could help convince the Fed that inflation pressures will continue to cool and that further rate hikes may not be needed.\nOn Wall Street, traders appeared to signal their growing belief in that scenario. Bond yields fell and stock prices rose sharply after the jobs report was released, indicating optimism that the Fed will decide it won\u2019t need to impose additional rate hikes.\nThe unemployment rate rose last month from 3.8% to 3.9%. And in another sign of a possible softening in the labor market, the Labor Department revised down its estimate of job growth in August and September by a combined 101,000.\nThe UAW strikes contributed to an overall loss of 35,000 factory positions in October. Several other sectors posted solid job gains last month, notably healthcare, which added 58,000, government agencies 51,000 and construction companies 23,000.\nBy contrast, the vast leisure and hospitality sector, which includes bars, restaurants and hotels, reported only modest job growth. So did professional and business services, a category that includes such high-paying occupations as accounting, engineering and architecture.\nWage pressures, which have been gradually slowing, eased further in October. Average hourly pay rose 0.2% from September and 4.1% from 12 months earlier. The year-over-year wage increase was the lowest since June 2021; the month-over-month rise was the smallest since February 2022.\nThe Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022 to try to slow the economy and tame inflation, which hit a four-decade high last year but has slowed sharply since then. In September, consumer prices rose 3.7% from a year earlier, down drastically from a year-over-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022 but still well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target level.\nThe U.S. job market has remained on firm footing despite those rate hikes and has helped fuel consumer spending, the primary driver of the economy. Employers have now added a healthy 204,000 jobs a month over the past three months. The combination of a solid economy and decelerating inflation has raised hopes that the Fed can nail a so-called soft landing \u2014 raising rates just enough to tame inflation without triggering a recession.\n\u201cThis is still a good labor market,\u2019\u2019 said Nick Bunker, head of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \u201cThere\u2019s no recession right now that you can see in the labor market data.\u2019\u2019 Bunker added that the October jobs numbers are \u201cmostly consistent with the soft landing story.\u2019\u2019\nFor the Fed, one unwelcome note in Friday\u2019s report is that the number of people in the labor force \u2013 those who either have a job or are looking for one \u2014 fell by 201,000 in October. It was the first such drop since April. Over the past year, more than 3 million people have entered the workforce, making it easier for companies to fill job openings. This has reduced pressure on employers to jack up pay and pass on their higher labor costs to their customers through higher prices. But the trend was broken last month.\nSince matching a half-century low of 3.4% in April, the nation\u2019s unemployment rate has more or less steadily edged up. The 3.9% rate in October was the highest level since January 2022. Still, historically, any jobless rate below 5% has been considered healthy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a clear upward trajectory in the unemployment rate,\u2033 Bunker said. \u201dIt\u2019s not at the point where it\u2019s tripping any alarms or causing blinking, flashing red lights ... but it is something to monitor.\u2033\nThe Fed\u2019s policymakers are trying to calibrate their key rate to simultaneously cool inflation, support job growth and ward off a recession. Despite long-standing predictions that the Fed\u2019s ever-higher rates would trigger a recession, the U.S. economy grew at a 4.9% annual pace from July through September, the fastest quarterly expansion in more than two years.\nAnd many companies are still looking to hire \u2014 and benefiting from the job market\u2019s slowdown.\nOne of them is Saltbox, which offers co-working space and warehouse services for about small business in 10 states. Last year, the company felt compelled to raise pay from $15 to $20 for hourly workers who load merchandise on trucks and do maintenance work. Now, Tyler Scriven, the company\u2019s founder and CEO, no longer sees a need to further raise pay.\n\u201cThe pressure of raising wages,\u201d Scriven said, \u201cis easing. I would go further to say that at this point, I don\u2019t really feel any pressure.\u2019\u2019\nLikewise, Omaha Steaks had struggled since the start of the pandemic with a big problem: Holiday-season employees who didn\u2019t show up for the first day of work, particularly at its distribution centers. At the time, no-show employees were a major headache for many companies. A year ago, Omaha Steaks, which has been shipping meats directly to consumers since 1952, had to hire 10% more holiday workers to account for the high quit rate.\nThis year, based on the past few weeks of holiday hiring, the show-up rates have improved markedly. It\u2019s a sign that Nate Rempe, the company\u2019s president and chief operating officer, said he thinks reflects a more normal job environment. Omaha Steaks, based in Omaha, Nebraska, no longer has to hire extra holiday workers to make up for the no-shows. In fact, it\u2019s hiring modestly fewer people.\n\u201cThey actually want to get to work, which we love to see because it\u2019s good for business,\u201d Rempe said.\n____\nD\u2019Innocenzio reported from New York.",

        "text": "\n(Adds context about cyber security strategy in paragraph 6)\nBy Byron Kaye\nSYDNEY, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Australia's second-largest telco, Optus, had no crisis plan when a network-wide outage left nearly half the country without phone or internet for 12 hours, an executive told parliament on Friday, acknowledging the company's defences had failed.\nThe Singapore Telecommunications-owned company had recently war-gamed scenarios in which the routers that direct voice and internet data failed in entire states, but it never expected a nationwide shutdown because it had alternate connections built into its network.\n\"We didn't have a plan in place for that specific scale of outage,\" Optus managing director of networks Lambo Kanagaratnam told a Senate hearing on the Nov. 8 failure that left much of the country unable to make payments, receive healthcare or contact emergency services for most of a day.\n\"It was unexpected. We have high levels of redundancy and it's not something that we expect to happen,\" he added, using the telecommunications term for alternate routes to send data when an initial pathway fails.\nThe comments underscore concerns about the resilience of Australia's telecommunications networks, which have been in the spotlight since a massive data breach at Optus last year exposed the personal data of 10 million Australians. Now the company faces a fresh reputational crisis after the service blackout, which it has said was triggered by a standard software upgrade at Singtel.\nThe Australian government has already imposed tougher cyber security reporting standards on telcos, and has said it plans to introduce mandatory reporting of ransomware attacks in all sectors as part of an overhaul of the country's cyber security laws to be announced this month.\nKanagaratnam told the hearing Optus never expected a total shutdown because it had filters designed to stop all 90 of the company's routers from being overloaded with data. But the filters failed, cutting the company's ability to send data on alternate routes.\n\"The outage was a result of our defence not working as it should have,\" he said. \"Our network should have been able to deal with the change.\"\nThe length of the outage - from about 4am to 4pm local time - was because Optus had to physically reboot all 90 routers plus another 50 core network devices, he added.\nOptus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, asked why the company took six hours to dispel public concerns it was under a cyber attack, told the hearing \"there were some strange coincidences that made us quite worried about that\" because the Singtel board was in the country that day.\nBayer Rosmarin said 228 calls to Australian emergency hotline Triple-0 failed to connect because of the outage, but the telco had followed up all incidents and \"thankfully everybody is OK\".\nAsked whether Optus was overly reliant on third-party contractors, Bayer Rosmarin said \"it is something I do think we should look at, in terms of the right level of outsourcing and insourcing\".\nSingtel has said that although Optus experienced an outage after its software upgrade, the upgrade itself was not the cause.\n($1 = 1.5473 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Gerry Doyle)",

He changed his stance when Rithm raised its bid to $12.70 a share from an initial $11.15 that rose to $12 last month. Saba Capital Management founder Weinstein and his group have offered to pay $13.50 a share.\nBeauchemin contends in his revised Delaware Chancery Court lawsuit that Rithm \u201cbrazenly bought off\u201d Och and his group to ensure \u201ctheir support for Rithm\u2019s underpriced deal.\u201d\nSculptor, Och and Rithm declined to comment on the revised complaint.\nSculptor shareholders are scheduled to vote Nov. 16 on whether to accept Rithm\u2019s bid. At a hearing two days before then, Beauchemin will urge Chancery Judge Sam Glasscock III to block the deal so investors can consider the Weinstein group\u2019s offer.\nThe Guarantee\nAccording to a transcript of a Nov. 1 hearing, Och\u2019s lawyers told Glasscock the $173 million payment was for an obligation that was already in place and wasn\u2019t tied to Och\u2019s change of heart on the deal. The $5.5 million was earmarked for Och and his group as repayment for litigation costs over two years, Andrew Levander, one of Och\u2019s attorneys, said at the hearing.\nThe fight, which started before Och\u2019s 2019 departure from the firm, has included multiple lawsuits and personal attacks against Levin. The Och group ultimately agreed to Rithm\u2019s offer after getting concessions over the CIO\u2019s employment agreement with Rithm and the boost in price closer to Weinstein\u2019s bid.

The U.S. has also sent the artillery to Israel as it fights Hamas.\nDoug Bush, the chief weapons buyer for the Army, told reporters that supplemental funding currently being considered by Congress as a apart of U.S. President Joe Biden's $106 billion request would go to modernize or build 155 millimeter artillery production facilities across many states including Texas, Tennessee, Virginia and California.\n\"The funding will expand production lines, strengthen the American economy and create new jobs,\" Bush told reporters.\nOf the $3.1 billion specific to 155 artillery, about half would go to boosting industrial capacity with the remainder going to buying rounds, Bush said.\nOther parts of Biden's $106 billion supplemental request, outside the $3.1 billion earmarked for 155 millimeter artillery, would go to funding expansion of other munitions, Bush said, including funds to boost the annual production rate of Patriot air defense interceptors to 650 from 550.\nDemand for 155 mm artillery rounds has soared in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Allies' supplies for their own defense have been run down as they have rushed shells to Kyiv, which fires thousands of rounds per day.\nThe U.S. plans to increase its monthly production rate for 155 millimeter artillery shells to 100,000 in 2025.\nIn its most recent earnings report General Dynamics said it benefited from Pentagon spending to replace equipment sent to Ukraine, including 155 millimeter artillery.

        "text": "\nBy Davide Barbuscia and Carolina Mandl\nNEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - As U.S. regulators ready rules that would push more trading in Treasuries to a central clearing venue, the industry's focus is turning on a key question: how much collateral should hedge funds and others put up to trade there.\nAt issue is whether imposing minimum requirements for collateral, called margin or haircuts, would raise trading costs and curb market liquidity versus the need to guard against a painful collapse in the world's biggest bond market.\nIndustry practice suggests that a large share of hedge funds trading in repo markets put up zero collateral, meaning they are fuelling activity using enormous amounts of cheap debt.\nThat has raised concerns among regulators that too much risk has built into the system and market stress could lead to a disorderly unwind of positions by such highly leveraged traders and threaten financial stability.\nIn recent weeks, there has been increased focus on the pros and cons of a standard margin imposed on all such trades.\n\"Over time competitive forces have driven haircuts down to zero,\" said Christopher Clarke, head of North America Sovereign Financing Trading at J.P. Morgan Securities, at a Treasury market conference held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last week. \"Ultimately what does it mean from my perspective, a dealer? What does it mean for my costs and risks?\"\nA looming rule by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would expand the use of central clearing in the cash Treasury and repo market.\nCentral clearing would require market participants to deposit margins, at a level possibly established by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), to protect against the risk of a counterparty's default. SEC chair Gary Gensler recently promoted the benefits of central clearing and pointed to data showing high levels of repo trades transacted at zero haircuts.\nThe stakes are high. Imposing a hypothetical 200 basis point minimum haircut on trades would mean funds would need to put up an extra $12.4 billion in capital to support trades, reducing their leverage levels, a recent paper by U.S. Federal Reserve economists showed.\nSome in the industry are in favor of the regulators' push. James Tabacchi, CEO of South Street Securities, called zero haircuts a \"race to the bottom\" and not healthy for markets. Tabacchi argued that large banks have the opportunity to not charge their clients haircuts, which has driven out smaller dealers.\nHowever, some market participants have voiced concerns that some of the proposed reforms could be a hurdle for some investors, potentially undermining the goal to improve liquidity and resilience in the Treasury market.\n\"A total centrally cleared model, while it has its benefits ... will increase the cost of trading and will create barriers to enter the Treasury market,\" said Richard Chambers, global head of repo trading and global co-head of short macro trading at Goldman Sachs.\n(Reporting by Davide Barbuscia and Carolina Mandl; editing by Megan Davies, Paritosh Bansal and Sonali Paul)",

The report strengthened financial market expectations that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates for the current cycle, and improved the chances of the U.S. central bank engineering a \"soft-landing\" for the economy rather than plunging it into recession as some economists had feared.\n\"This is a very Fed-friendly report,\" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. \"The only wrinkle is that the labor force shrank. Still, the overall softness in the report will go a long way to keeping the Fed on the sidelines for a third straight meeting in December.\"\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 jobs last month after rising by 297,000 in September, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 180,000.\nAbout 52.0% of private sector industries reported increases in employment, the lowest since April 2020, compared to 61.4% in September, the survey of establishments showed.\nManufacturing employment dropped 35,000, with the UAW strike at Ford Motor, General Motors and Chrysler parent Stellantis factories as well as at Mack Trucks plants subtracting 33,000 jobs.\nIn addition to the industrial action, which has since ended, the slowdown in employment gains last month was pay-back after September's gains, which were the largest in eight months.\nThough hiring is slowing as a result of the cumulative impact of rate hikes from the Fed, payroll gains remain way above the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\n\"A payroll increase of 150,000 is not bad, and 180,000 - what it would have been without the strike and ancillary impacts - is solid,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. \"So, no need to worry about excessive weakness at least until we see what the post-strike environment looks like.\"\nLast month's increase in hiring was led by the healthcare sector, which added 58,000 jobs, the bulk of them in ambulatory health care services. Employment in government increased by 51,000 positions, returning to its pre-pandemic level. The rise in government payrolls was driven by local government hiring.\nThe construction industry added 23,000 jobs. There were also gains in social assistance as well as professional and business services payrolls, with temporary help jobs - a harbinger of future hiring - rebounding after eight straight monthly declines. Leisure and hospitality employment rose 19,000, well below the monthly average of 52,000 in the last 12 months.\nThe transportation and warehousing industry suffered job losses as did the information industry, continuing to be weighed down by an ongoing strike in Hollywood.\nFinancial markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to keep rates unchanged in December and January, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. Stocks on Wall Street rallied. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note hitting a five-week low.\nWAGE GROWTH COOLS\nThe U.S. central bank held rates unchanged on Wednesday but left the door open to a further rise in borrowing costs in a nod to the economy's resilience. Since March 2022, it has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% band.\nAverage hourly earnings rose 0.2% in October after climbing 0.3% in September. In the 12 months through October, wages increased 4.1%, the smallest increase since June 2021, after rising 4.3% in September. The average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.4 hours. Aggregate hours worked fell 0.3%. Both reflected the impact of the auto strikes on the economy.\nThe labor market is the major force behind the economy's staying power, with gross domestic product recording an annualized growth pace of nearly 5% in the third quarter.\nThough wage pressures are easing because of a recent expansion of the labor pool and fewer people changing jobs, the annual growth in average hourly earnings remains above the 3.5% that economists say is consistent with the Fed's 2% target.\n\"We'll see a significant deceleration in growth in the fourth quarter, but not in a way that we're plunging into any kind of recession,\" said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Forecasting.\nEconomists were split on the impact of record-breaking labor contracts, including the ones scored by the UAW, airline pilots and the union representing UPS workers, on wage inflation.\nSome argued that the recent surge in worker productivity, if maintained, would be enough to offset the higher compensation. Others pointed out that the U.S. economy was now predominantly based on services, which would make it harder to boost productivity.\nEbbing labor market momentum was also evident in the smaller household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived. Household employment fell 348,000, accounting for the rise in the jobless rate. The strike also impacted the unemployment rate. About 201,000 people dropped out of the labor force.\nThat lowered the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, to 62.7% from 62.8% in September.\nThe prime-age group participation rate declined, mostly because of men dropping out of the labor force.\nThe ranks of Americans experiencing long-term unemployment increased 66,000 to 1.282 million. The number of people working part-time for economic reasons rose 218,000 to 4.283 million. There was also an increase in people working multiple jobs.\n\"October's employment report, in conjunction with the third-quarter report on productivity and costs, clearly indicates that the economy has converged already to potentially a more sustainable path of low inflation and solid potential growth,\" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Paul Simao)",

        "text": "\nBy Steven Scheer\nJERUSALEM, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Measures taken by the Bank of Israel since the start of the Gaza war last month have stabilized financial markets without the need for lower interest rates, central bank Governor Amir Yaron said on Thursday.\nSpeaking on a panel at an International Monetary Fund research conference in Washington, Yaron said Israel's economy is \"strong and stable\" with \"robust and healthy economic foundations\" that will allow the country to recover quickly and return to prosperity.\nAt the outset of war that began on Oct. 7 when militants from the Islamist Palestinian group Hamas rampaged through towns in southern Israel, the central bank moved to defend the shekel through a $30 billion programme to sell foreign currency and provided liquidity through swap operations.\nIt also enacted a plan with commercial banks and credit card companies for those affected by the war to defer interest on loans.\n\"This array of policy steps that were taken by the Bank of Israel in the last month reveals the sufficient and necessary independence that the bank enjoys, and that it has an adequate set of monetary tools that can ensure financial stability,\" Yaron said.\n\"Avoiding a reduction in the rates is in line with operating in the FX market to moderate large depreciation fluctuations,\" he said, adding that steps taken by banks were \"in practice, some monetary easing,\" targeted at those who need it most, without raising the risk premia in financial markets.\nMarkets were initially stunned by the Hamas attacks, which Israel says killed 1,400 people and saw more than 240 others taken hostage. The shekel tumbled 5% and reached an 11-year low, pushing its 2023 losses to 15%. Share prices sank and bond yields jumped.\nBut markets have reversed in November, with the shekel and bond yields returning to pre-war levels and stocks coming off their lows. At the same time, the cost of insuring Israel's government debt against default slid to its lowest level since Oct. 12.\n\"One month in, we can cautiously say that the policy mix we applied contributed to the stability not only of the FX market, but also had positive spillovers for the stability of local financial markets,\" Yaron said.\nHe also said that while fiscal policy is crucial for the ability of the Israeli economy to overcome the crisis and resume growth, the government needs to balance \"supporting the economy and maintaining a sound fiscal position.\"\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to \"open the taps\" to help those impacted by the war, including financing the military and compensating populations on the border and families of victims and hostages taken by Hamas.\n\"I have no doubt that, as always, Israel will prevail and has the right ingredients to spring back to its great economic potential,\" Yaron said.

The index was up 0.3% for the week.\n\"This time of the month there are month end flows that tend to predominate at certain points,\" Bipan Rai, North America head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets, said.\n\"I would expect some of that is reflected in the price action that we are seeing for the dollar today,\" he said.\nRai noted that following big gains for the July-September period the dollar has struggled to make further advances despite relatively upbeat U.S. economic data.\n\"We have seen some signals, at least in the near term, that the dollar is a bit overbought,\" said Rai, who still expects the dollar to remain strong, aided by the U.S. economic growth picture.\nTraders appeared hesitant on Friday to place big directional bets in FX markets ahead of the Federal Reserve and Bank Of Japan policy meeting next week.\n\"Additional positioning doesn't really make sense until those two key risk events are out of the way,\" Rai said.\nCooling inflation will likely keep the Fed on pause in coming months, traders bet on Friday, even as persistent underlying price pressures amid strong consumer spending kept some chance of a rate hike later this year in play.\nThe U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the third quarter, data on Thursday showed, as higher wages from a tight labour market helped power consumer spending.\nThe European Central Bank on Thursday left interest rates unchanged as expected, ending an unprecedented streak of 10 consecutive rate hikes.\nThe euro was 0.17% higher at $1.05775 on Friday.\nData earlier this week showed euro zone business activity took a surprise turn for the worse this month.\nOverall risk sentiment improved a little on Friday with the Australian dollar, often used as a proxy for risk appetite, climbing 0.55% to $0.63565, having slid to a one-year low of $0.6271 on Thursday.\nMeanwhile the yen pulled back from 150 per dollar, a level some have seen as a potential trigger for intervention by Japanese authorities.\nDollar/yen was 0.5% lower at 149.74.\nJapan will continue to respond to the currency market \"with a strong sense of urgency,\" Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told reporters on Friday.\nThe BOJ meets next week and speculation is mounting that the central bank could change its policy on bond-yield control. An increase to an existing limit on yields set just three months ago has been discussed as a possibility.\nIn cryptocurrency markets, bitcoin slipped 0.55% to $33,977. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap has advanced sharply in recent sessions helped by speculation that an exchange-traded bitcoin fund is imminent.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper London, Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by David Holmes and Mike Harrison)",

        "text": "\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping swept into San Francisco on Tuesday as the two leaders made their final preparations for their first engagement in a year at a historic estate outside of the city.\nBiden expressed hope that the talks would help put a shaky U.S.-China relationship \u2014 marked by sharp differences over the last year \u2014 in a better place. The two leaders arrived in the city to be greeted by hundreds of demonstrators who lined up along their motorcade routes, waving Chinese, Taiwanese and Tibetan flags as well as signs in support of and opposition to the Chinese leader.\nBiden, before leaving Washington to make his way West on Tuesday to attend this year\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, said his broad goal was to get Washington and Beijing \"on a normal course corresponding\" once again even as they have sharp differences on no shortage of issues.\n\u201cBeing able to pick up the phone and talk to one another if there\u2019s a crisis. Being able to make sure our militaries still have contact with one another,\u201d Biden told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to decouple from China, but what we\u2019re trying to do is change the relationship for the better.\u201d\nThe two leaders will meet at Filoli Estate, a country house museum about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of San Francisco, according to three senior administration officials. The officials requested anonymity to discuss the venue, which has not yet been confirmed by the White House and Chinese government.\nThe State Department announced Tuesday that the two countries, the world's two biggest pollutera, have agreed to \u201cpursue efforts to triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030,\" an effort to step up wind, solar and other renewable energy.\nThe announcement came after John Kerry, Biden\u2019s climate envoy, met earlier this month with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, at the Sunnylands estate in southern California for talks on the matter.\nSeparately, a U.S. official confirmed that Biden and Xi are expected to announce an agreement that would restore talks under what's known as the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement. The agreement is used by the U.S. and People's Liberation Army navies and air forces to improve safety in the air and sea. Until 2020, they had been meeting regularly since 1998 for the talks. The official requested anonymity to preview the expected leaders' announcement.\nBiden arrived at San Francisco International Airport Tuesday afternoon and Xi landed shortly after. The Chinese president was welcomed on the tarmac by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.\nHundreds of onlookers gathered on the leaders' motorcade route, some holding signs that read \u201cEnd CCP,\u201d the initials of Chinese Communist Party. Another sign read \u201cWarmly Welcome President Xi Jinping\u201d and was affixed to concrete bollards.\nPro-China and anti-China demonstrators also gathered near the Moscone Center, the venue where many APEC meetings were being held.\nBeijing supporters waved U.S. and Chinese flags as they waited for Xi\u2019s motorcade to arrive at the swanky hotel near the convention center where the Chinese delegation is staying. Several supporters used oversized Chinese national flags to obscure the few Xi critics there and used loudspeakers to play the patriotic \u201cOde to the Motherland.\u201d\nScuffles broke out between the two groups, but police quickly intervened to maintain order. The crowds were kept out of the road by tall, metal barriers.\nWei Gong, of Charlottesville, Virginia, brought her 9-year-old daughter, Deanna Wei, to welcome Xi. Her child wore a traditional Chinese, horse-face skirt and held U.S. and Chinese flags.\n\u201cI have never seen him,\u201d the mother said of Xi. \u201cWe just want to see him.\u201d\nLater, protesters gathered just blocks from the Moscone Center to call for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.\nBiden, despite his busy diplomatic agenda, took some time Tuesday evening to tend to his 2024 reelection campaign, joining Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris for a fundraiser at San Francisco's iconic Merchant Exchange Club.\nThe long complicated U.S.-Chinese relationship has come under heavy strain over the last year, with Beijing bristling over new U.S. export controls on advanced technology; Biden ordering the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon after it traversed the continental United States; and Chinese anger over a stopover in the U.S. by Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen earlier this year, among other issues. China claims the island as its territory.\nThe talks at Filoli will give the leaders a chance to try to dial back tensions in a picturesque backdrop.\nThe sprawling estate along Northern California\u2019s coastal range features a Georgian revival-style mansion and English Renaissance gardens. It was built in 1917 as a private residence but was opened to the public in 1975 as a nonprofit and site of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\nWealthy San Francisco socialite William Bowers Bourn II named Filoli by taking the first two letters of key words of his personal credo, according to the estate\u2019s website: \u201cFight for a just cause. Love your Fellow Man. Live a Good Life.\u201d The estate's gardens feature in Jennifer Lopez\u2019s film \u201cThe Wedding Planner.\u201d\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Biden is coming to Wednesday's meeting in a strong position.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be afraid to \u2014- to confront where confrontation is needed on issues where we don\u2019t see eye to eye with President Xi and the PRC,\u201d said Kirby, using the initials for the People's Republic of China.\nBiden will also be looking to use this week\u2019s summit of Asia-Pacific leaders to demonstrate that the United States has the gumption, attention span and money to focus on the region even as it grapples with a multitude of foreign and domestic policy crises.\nThe White House wants to demonstrate that Biden can remain focused on the Pacific while also trying to keep the Israel-Hamas war from exploding into a broader regional conflict and to persuade Republican lawmakers to continue to spend billions more on the costly Ukrainian effort to repel Russia\u2019s nearly 21-month old invasion.\nWhite House officials say they are also cognizant that fellow APEC nations want to see better dialogue between the U.S. and China because it reduces the risk of regional conflict. At the same time, they also know that others in the region are concerned that the Pacific is too often seen through a prism in which the dominant power centers in Washington and Beijing make decisions for the region without engagement from less powerful nations.\nBiden enters the Xi meeting feeling buoyed by the U.S. economy\u2019s strong performance. While the majority of U.S. adults believe the economy is weak, Biden has managed to prove wrong a large swath of economists who predicted that millions of layoffs and a recession might be needed to bring down inflation. The Labor Department said Tuesday that consumer prices rose at an annual pace of 3.2% annually, down from a June 2022 peak of 9.1%. Meanwhile, employers keep hiring and the unemployment rate has held below 4% for nearly two years.\nBeijing released economic data last month that shows prices falling due to slack demand from consumers and businesses. The International Monetary Fund recently cut growth forecasts for China, predicting economic growth of 5% this year and 4.2% in 2024, down slightly from its forecasts in July.\n___\nLong reported from Washington.

        "text": "\nBy Ally Levine, Anurag Rao, Adolfo Arranz and Dea Bankova\n(Reuters) - As Walt Disney turns 100, investors worry it's beginning to show its age. The share price dropped to its lowest level in nearly nine years as the company stumbles in the age of streaming.\nBut adapting to the times is not a new challenge for Disney, rather it\u2019s been a point of survival throughout the company\u2019s history.\nA century ago when \u201cDisney\u201d was a single person, not a global company worth over $150 billion, emerging sound and color technologies rattled the silent film industry.\nBut Walt Disney had a strong motivation for embracing these new tools -- to capture the audience.\n\u201cHe wanted his animation to be believable, he wanted it to transcend what we typically think of as animation,\u201d said Chris Pallant, professor of animation and screen studies at Canterbury Christ Church University in the United Kingdom.\nDisney Studios opened in Hollywood in 1923 \u2013 geographically and conceptually distant from the animation powerhouses in New York. Disney envisioned a future in which animated features would garner the same respect as the live-action films being shot down the street.\nHe obsessed over quality and poured money into producing cartoons that would resonate with his audience. He wrote that observing the real world was key and animation must have, \u201ca foundation of fact, in order that it may more richly possess sincerity.\u201d\nThe studio formalized 12 principles of animation which transformed static sketches into lively characters on a screen. Veteran animators taught the principles to each of the new artists who joined the studio to ensure consistency.\nANIMATION LEADER\nWalt Disney entered the animation scene as a young businessman, well positioned to capitalize on existing techniques and embrace new tools. He and his studio harnessed sound, color and 3D camera technology with an organized and scalable approach, which was not necessarily cost-effective but produced high-quality animations.\nSeemingly each time Disney\u2019s projects were financially successful, he would use the money to double his aspirations for the next film. \u201cIn a way,\u201d Pallant said, \u201cDisney survives his own ambition.\u201d\nDisney Studios managed to lead the Western animation industry for decades through its innovations and dedication to captivating stories. But its reign would not last as a new technology arrived and Disney was late to greet it.\nBy the turn of the century, Pixar\u2019s progress in computer-generated animations had eclipsed Disney\u2019s traditional hand-drawn style, namely with the first totally computer-generated animation \u201cToy Story\u201d. But Disney didn\u2019t need to innovate its way out of its problems this time. It could rely on a new tool: money. Merchandise, theme parks and cable TV had filled the company\u2019s pockets for decades. Disney bought Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, and with it, Pixar\u2019s ability to enchant audiences with pixels.\nAs a hand-drawn studio, Disney\u2019s eventual recognition of computer animation is an important moment, said Pallant who is also the president for the Society for Animation Studies. \u201cI think that is an echo back to an earlier life,\u201d Pallant said. \u201cThey were not afraid to move with the times. That shows you the willingness to reinvent themselves as a 75- or 80-year-old company.\u201d\nNow at the 100-year mark, streaming poses yet another challenge. Disney\u2019s early gambles in new technology produced quality films that distinguished the studio from its competitors. Later, embracing computers preserved the studio as a major player in animation. Now, stockholders are closely watching what Disney will do as it moves into its next century.\n(Reporting by Ally Levine, Anurag Rao, Adolfo Arranz and Dea Bankova; Additional reporting by Prinz Magtulis; Editing by Julia Wolfe and Lisa Shumaker)",

        "text": "\n(Adds details on deal paragraph 5, comments from chief negotiator paragraphs 21-22)\nBy Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine\nLOS ANGELES, Nov 8 (Reuters) - To thousands of rank-and-file Hollywood actors, Fran Drescher emerged this summer as a modern-day labor hero who secured a hard-fought deal. To studio executives who negotiated with the SAG-AFTRA president, the former star of \"The Nanny\" prolonged a strike while she relished her high-profile role.\nNot since her portrayal of Fran Fine, a one-time bridal shop attendant from Queens who winds up caring for a Broadway producer's three children in the 1990s sitcom, had Drescher seen so much screen time.\nHer memorable portrayal of the nanny, with her nasal voice, loud fashion, and deftly executed pratfalls, garnered her two Emmy nominations. As president of the 160,000-member SAG-AFTRA union, Drescher won widespread praise from performers for her tenacity in fighting for better wages and protections against the rising threat of artificial intelligence technology.\n\"She's a really good wartime president,\" said Kate Bond, who played Jill Morgan on CBS series \"MacGyver.\"\nUnder Drescher's leadership, SAG-AFTRA walked off the job in mid-July, halting most film and scripted television production. After 118 days, negotiators announced on Wednesday they had reached an agreement valued at more than $1 billion over three years.\nDrescher framed her actions as part of a broader labor movement battling Corporate America, where, in her view, executives place Wall Street's approval and their own compensation ahead of the welfare of workers.\n\"We are the victims here. We are being victimized by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us,\" Drescher said at a July news conference. \"I cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty. That they're losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them.\"\nA PRO-PROLETARIAT VIEW\nDrescher's remarks, which struck some as vitriolic, were reminiscent of Norma Rae, the title character in a 1970s movie based on a cotton-mill worker who rallied co-workers to unionize.\n\"In the context of the global labor movement, I understood what she was doing,\" said attorney Ivy Kagan Bierman, chair of the entertainment labor practice at Loeb & Loeb. \"In the role of Norma Rae, she gave the Norma Rae speech.\"\nStudio executives, who declined to criticize Drescher publicly to avoid inflaming labor talks, said the 66-year-old Drescher delivered similar unvarnished critiques to industry leaders during closed-door negotiations. They said the union boss talked about achieving a transfer of wealth from the CEO yachting class to actors struggling to make a living on guild minimum wages.\nThe composition of the union bargaining team reflected Drescher's pro-proletariat view: some of the 42 members failed to qualify for SAG-AFTRA's healthcare insurance because they earned less than $26,470 per year. This served to extend the strike, in the view of one studio chief, who observed, \"We're negotiating with people who have nothing to lose.\"\nThe executives described Drescher as an actor enjoying her biggest role in years. Her last recurring role was in NBC sitcom \"Indebted,\" which ran for one season in 2020.\nThat view is just \"rhetoric,\" said Shari Belafonte, a member of the SAG-AFTRA TV/theatrical negotiating committee. \"Fran's unwavering commitment to the SAG-AFTRA membership is what drives her.\"\n\"We are in a paradigm shift,\" Belafonte added. \"Her interest as the union president is to see all performers, from background to the top 2%, succeed in a vibrant industry for the next century and beyond.\"\n'A BIG CHAMPION'\nAs negotiations intensified in October, reports emerged that Drescher brought a stuffed, heart-shaped toy to contract talks with executives including Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger and Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos. Union members viewed the accounts as attempts to undermine Drescher's credibility and started bringing their own plush toys to picket lines to show support.\n\"It's OK to have things that make you comfortable. It doesn't make you any less professional,\" said actor Kimberly Westbrook, who carried a stuffed penguin and wore a \"Don't F\u2013 With Fran\" pin while picketing Amazon Studios. \"We're actors. We are eccentric people.\"\n\"I love that she is not apologetic for who she is,\" Westbrook added.\nDrescher said she did not need to \"emulate a masculine energy to be a good leader.\"\n\"I can be smart, have a keen ability (to see) integral flaws in a business model AND put a tiny heart-shaped plush toy (between) me & Iger,\" she wrote on the social media platform X.\nSAG-AFTRA's chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said Drescher was \"not afraid to speak truth to power, and she did exactly that\" at the bargaining table.\nDrescher also \"really tried to humanize what can sometimes be a very cold process, and I thought that was really a valuable contribution,\" he said.\nUnion members said they admired the fearlessness of an actress who survived being raped at gunpoint in her 20s and battled uterine cancer in her 40s. Many also saw her unconventional approach as an asset.\n\"She scares the shit out of these CEOs precisely because she can't be put in a box (or a corner),\" actor Justine Bateman wrote on X. \"If you can't see the leverage in that, then you don't understand negotiating.\"\nActor Alex Plank, who appears opposite Bobby Cannavale and Robert De Niro in \"Ezra,\" admitted he knew little about Drescher before the strike, beyond her distinctive voice.\n\"She's turned out to be a big champion, someone with heart,\" Plank said. \"I was skeptical at first, to be honest with you, because I didn't know anything about her, and she turned out to be more than we could have ever asked for.\"\n(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine; Editing by Mary Milliken, Rosalba O'Brien and Gerry Doyle)",

On Monday, Walmart stepped up discounts on some clothing to 60%, up from the 50% it offered on Black Friday.\n(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale and Arriana McLymore in New York, and Deborah Sophia, Aishwarya Venogupal and Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru Editing by David Gregorio, Nick Zieminski, Matthew Lewis and Lincoln Feast)",

Helped by positive sentiment and resilient valuations, Lori Calvasina at RBC Capital Markets forecasts the S&P 500 will jump to a record high next year, as does Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Savita Subramanian. The latter is optimistic because firms, she said, will learn to adapt to the higher rate environment.\nThe enthusiasm has even prompted hedge funds to hold their most concentrated wagers on US equities in 22 years with most popular bets in megacap tech. Mutual funds also increased their exposure to the sector in the third quarter, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nOf those that capitulated include a pool of rules-based money known as commodity trading advisers. After sitting on the sidelines in late October, CTAs bought more than $60 billion worth of global equities in the last two weeks, according to Nicolas Le Roux of US Group AG, who expects flows to continue though at a slower pace.\nNot everyone is buying. Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets, is still concerned about recession risks and inflationary pressures, particularly on the services side. Americans feel it too. US short-term inflation expectations climbed to a seven-month high while longer-run price views remained at levels not seen since 2011.\n\u201cCurrent economic data still does not justify the current aggressive policy normalization,\u201d said Veitmane. \u201cThus, rates need to stay higher for longer, which will most likely push us into recession which means that earnings expectation are too high. So, no we are not backing this rally.\u201d\nTo Peter Chatwell, head of global macro strategies trading at Mizuho International Plc., the fact that ratey cuts may be coming is no sustainable reason for elated market sentiment.\n\u201cIf the Fed is cutting rates because of a recession, this is very unlikely to be supportive of stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems that stocks are in a sweet spot which will require a major earnings increase to allow this level to be maintained.\u201d\n--With assistance from Elena Popina.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

The White House wants to schedule a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping alongside the summit.\nTRADE, INVESTMENT LINKS\nYellen said the Biden administration was committed to expanding trade and investment with Indo-Pacific countries, emphasizing the region's strategic importance ahead of the APEC gathering.\nDeeper economic links with Indo-Pacific countries will help make U.S. supply chains more resilient and tap into a dynamic and growing market for U.S. exports, she said.\n\"As we look toward APEC later this month, let me state unequivocally: Claims that America is turning away from the Indo-Pacific are wholly unfounded,\" Yellen said in the excerpts. \"We are deepening our economic ties across the region, with tremendous potential benefits for the U.S. economy and for the Indo-Pacific.\"\nThe Biden administration also has called a seventh negotiating round for its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) initiative next week in San Francisco, aimed at reaching some agreements in time for the APEC summit.\nIPEF, while far short of a traditional free trade agreement, is the Biden administration's signature initiative to engage economically with Asian countries and provide them a trade and investment alternative to China.\nYellen said deeper integration with Indo-Pacific countries would benefit the region and the U.S. She noted that U.S. two-way trade with the region reached a value of $2.28 trillion in 2022, up 25% since 2019, with the region taking nearly a quarter of U.S. exports.\n\"The economic case for our expanding trade and investment is clear. The Indo-Pacific is a dynamic and rapidly growing region. As it grows, we gain a fast-expanding customer base for U.S. firms and workers,\" Yellen said.\nSUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY\nPart of the reason for increased trade with the region has been the migration of U.S. supply chains away from China, a trend that started with tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018 and accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic.\nYellen said economic engagement with Indo-Pacific countries, including Vietnam, is \"crucial to bolstering our supply chain security\" to avoid bottlenecks and shortages that occurred as the world emerged from the pandemic. She repeated her desire to diversify supply chains to countries in the region through \"friend-shoring\" or using trusted allies as sources of supply.\n\"And achieving resilience through partnering with Indo-Pacific countries means gains for Indo-Pacific economies as well,\" Yellen said.\n(Reporting by David Lawder;editing by Diane Craft)",

Wages are also likely to increase significantly next year,\" Kameda said in an interview on Wednesday, a day after the bank loosened the 1% cap on its target for long-term bond yields.\n\"Even as cost-push pressures ease, the rise in service prices and wages could broaden and persist,\" he said. \"I don't think the BOJ is focussing on such price pressures as much as it should, putting it at risk of being behind the curve.\"\nKameda said he expects the BOJ to take further steps to phase out its bond yield control policy, before ending negative short-term rates as early as April.\n\"The sooner the BOJ normalises policy, the better, as Japan shifts from a deflation-ridden economy to a country that's finally seeing some inflation,\" said Kameda, an economist at a think tank affiliated with Japan's Sompo Holdings insurance group.\nWith inflation exceeding the BOJ's 2% inflation target for more than a year, many analysts expect the bank to end its bond yield control and negative rate policy next year.\nBOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has stressed the need to keep policy ultra-loose until the recent cost-driven inflation turns into price rises driven by robust domestic demand and wage growth.

Same thing at the buyback desk at Bank of America Corp., which just had the busiest week of execution orders in the firm\u2019s data history.\nThe people in charge of the businesses are in buying mode, too. Corporate executives and officers have snapped up shares of their own firms in November, with the ratio of buyers to sellers set to touch a six-month high, according to data compiled by the Washington Service.\nThe splurge comes as stocks recover from their worst retreat of the year, with a rally underpinned by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will halt its rate-hike campaign as inflation cools. While skeptics point to the threat of a 2024 recession, corporate insiders have a strong track record in timing the market in recent years.\n\u201cWe could see insiders buying into the bull case of inflation down, rate hikes over, mission accomplished. Insiders want to take more ownership of that message and they are willing to pony up real money to do so,\u201d said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. \u201cThat is a double-barreled sign of optimism, with companies and individual executives buying back their stock.\u201d\nAs of Monday, almost 900 corporate insiders have purchased their own stock in November, more than double the previous month. While the number of sellers also rose, the pace of increases was smaller. As a result, the buy-sell ratio jumped to 0.54, the highest level since May.\nThe buying impetus pales next to March 2020, when insider buyers outnumbered sellers by a ratio of 2-to-1 at the exact bottom of the pandemic crash. Still, the bullish stance is a departure from July, when stocks climbed and insiders rushed to dump stocks. That exit proved prescient as the S&P 500 sank 10% over the following three months.\nNewfound vigor among business leaders echoes burgeoning bullishness elsewhere. From retail investors to big-money managers, bearish wagers are being unwound and fear of missing out is driving the S&P 500 toward one of its best Novembers in history. At Barclays Plc, strategists including Venu Krishna just raised their 2024 price target for the index by 300 points to 4,800.\nThe benchmark gauge was little changed at 4,551 as of 2:40 p.m. in New York after climbing more than 8% this month.\nAfter refraining from buybacks earlier this year, American firms are now embracing them. Repurchases among BofA\u2019s clients have stayed above seasonal levels for three weeks in a row, including one in which a record $4.8 billion was bought, according to data compiled by the firm\u2019s strategists including Jill Carey Hall and Savita Subramanian.\nCorporate buybacks will likely be running at $5 billion a day until the market enters an earnings-related blackout on Dec. 8, according to Scott Rubner, a managing director at Goldman, who has studied the flow of funds for two decades. Once the blackout window opens, the flow may drop by 35%, he estimates.\nThat may set the stage for choppy trading in the short term, especially after fast-money managers such as trend followers boosted stock holdings, making them more inclined to trim exposure should things go sour, Rubner warns.\n\u201cCorporate demand will start to fade next week,\u201d the Goldman veteran wrote in a note. \u201cThen the pain trade moves to the downside, no longer upside.\u201d\nViewed in a wider lens, however, buybacks can still offer support. By the tally from Goldman strategists including Cormac Conners, US firms have announced roughly $900 billion of share repurchases this year, poised for the third-highest annual total on record.\nCorporations in the S&P 500 returned to positive earnings growth during the third quarter after a streak of contractions, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. With profit expansions forecast to accelerate next year while interest rates are expected to drop, stocks can be viewed as an attractive investment \u2014 particularly those that were left in the dust during the 2023 rally that\u2019s been dominated by the seven largest tech giants, dubbed the Magnificent Seven, according to Bailey at FBB.\n\u201cThere are plenty of profitable and growing companies outside of the Magnificent 7 that have languishing stock prices this year,\u201d he said. \u201cInsiders could be chomping at the bit to buy these under-performers now on hopes of that we could see a reversal next year, with smaller companies beating the megacaps.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nChinese Car Companies Cracked North America by Going to Mexico\nScientists and Farmers Race to Save the World\u2019s Banana Supply\nMBA Alternative Augment Clinches $3.7 Million in New Funding\nDeepfake Pornography Victims Learn There Are No Laws to Fight It\nThe Bill for Big Stimulus Comes Due in Europe\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nAmid record-high temperatures, deluges, droughts and wildfires, leaders are convening for another round of United Nations climate talks later this month that seek to curb a centuries-long trend of humans spewing ever more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\nFor hundreds of years, people have shaped the world around them for their benefit: They drained lakes, deforested lands and mined for metals and minerals to grow wealth and economies. They dug up billions of tons of coal, and then oil and gas, to fuel empires and economies. The allure of exploiting nature and burning fossil fuels as a path to prosperity hopped from nation to nation, each eager to secure their own cheap energy. Over hundreds of years, that impulse has remade the planet\u2019s climate, too \u2014 and brought its inhabitants to the brink of catastrophe.\nAnya Zilberstein, a historian of climate science at Concordia University in Montreal, highlighted Europeans colonizing the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries as major factor of today's climate and environmental crises.\n\u201cThey bring with them this idea that conquest and then the development of the cultivation of landscapes, like taking down trees, opening up lands to European-style agriculture, that the draining of swamps ... will also change the climate, usually for the better,\u201d Zilberstein said.\nJan Golinski, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, said Europeans of the time thought that their changes \u2014 cutting down forests, draining swamps, plowing land \u2014 would change the climate as well, to something closer to their homelands. He said they saw this engineering as positive.\n\u201cThey believed that their society was making progress,\u201d Golinski said.\nThat early modern period solidified notions of industry, progress, productivity and growth that make it harder to tackle the current climate crisis, Zilberstein said.\nThen, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the balance tipped dramatically in coal's favor as an energy source, through technological advances like steam power, new transportation routes like canals and later railroads, and a desire to better control how, when and where energy was used.\nSteam power made it easier for factory owners to control labor and nature than an economy based on water power, for example, because they could be set up anywhere and weren't vulnerable to floods or droughts said Andreas Malm, an associate professor of human ecology at Lund University in Sweden.\nThe British then \"forcibly exported this model and integrated other countries such as India or Egypt or what became Nigeria into a kind of an economy that was dependent on fossil fuel,\u201d said Malm.\nOther nations then began \"searching for fossil fuels in various places in the Ottoman Empire, in the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere,\u201d said On Barak, a historian at Tel Aviv University and co-founder of the Laboratory for the History of Climate Change.\nThen came oil. Oil use grew in the late 19th century because it wasn\u2019t as labor-intensive as coal, whose workers now had strong unions in some Western nations, historians say.\nLike coal, oil was easy to store, it's more energy-rich than coal, and it\u2019s easier to move; as a liquid it can be shipped through pipes, as well as by trucks, tankers and railcars, said J.R. McNeill, a historian at Georgetown University.\nBy the 20th century, the growth in oil helped fuel technologies like cars and air travel that became more affordable in many global north countries. Other nations such as China, Japan and India began assembling their own energy regimes based on fossil fuels.\nAs Europe, the U.S. and Japan built their energy systems around internal combustion engines, it made the global investment in an oil-dominated fossil fuel regime \u201cgigantic and harder, but not impossible, to reverse or replace,\u201d McNeill said.\nMeanwhile, coal kept its place in the global economy.\nIn China and Japan, growing consumption was a signal and barometer of developing economies, said Victor Seow, a historian of science at Harvard University.

        "text": "\nBy Deborah Mary Sophia and Aishwarya Venugopal\n(Reuters) -Retailers like Amazon.com and Foot Locker are signaling optimism for holiday season sales after stronger-than-expected figures during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, as heavy discounts lured budget-strained customers on the peak U.S. shopping days.\nEarly estimates on holiday shopping have been encouraging to some investors after retailers sounded cautious notes in the lead-up to the season. Online sales in the U.S. during the five-day period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday hit a record $38 billion, according to Adobe Analytics, while the National Retail Federation said more than 200 million people shopped both in-store and online during the holiday weekend, surpassing estimates.\n\"While there are parts of the consumer that definitely are much slower and weaker, from a spending perspective, there's still a lot of money sitting on the sidelines... (The holiday season) actually could be a little bit better than what most people think,\" said Jimmy Lee, CEO of Wealth Consulting Group, which holds Amazon shares.\nEarlier this week, Ulta Beauty and Foot Locker bumped up their annual sales expectations, with the footwear retailer flagging a strong start to holiday selling on the back of steep discounts.\nBlack Friday store visits to recreational and sporting goods retailers were up 322.9% compared to the 2023 year-to-date daily average, while the category saw an increase of 305.2% the previous year, according to foot traffic data from Placer.ai.\n\"We know we're buying for wallet share with a value-conscious consumer this holiday season. Quarter-to-date, we've been pleased with the trends as consumers respond to our full-price holiday assortments in addition to our compelling deals,\" Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon said in a conference call on Wednesday.\nAmazon's extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event - which kicked off on Nov. 17 and continued through Nov. 27 - was its biggest ever compared to the same ending on Cyber Monday in previous years.\nThis year, during the week ending Nov. 25, card spending was 1.7% higher than in the week ending the day after Black Friday last year, according to a report from BofA Global research. The corresponding increases in spending on holiday items were also larger this year, the report said.\nDeep discounts have been a key feature heading into this year's holiday shopping season and holiday discounts could get even bigger in December, according to some retail executives.\nKohl's CEO Tom Kingsbury said last week the company was \"coming out on holiday very aggressively in terms of promotions.\"\nMost retailers including Walmart, and clothing chains Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters, have raised annual forecasts, putting them on track for a strong holiday quarter.\nSince Aug. 1, the consumer discretionary sector has recorded the highest percentage increase in earnings, according to LSEG IBES data.\nYet some retailers, including Kohl's, Best Buy and Lowe's Cos, have tempered their sales forecasts for the year.\n\"The U.S. consumer is bifurcated. Lower income households are pulling back on discretionary purchases... But outside of the lowest tier we believe household consumption remains resilient,\" Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt, said.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia and Juby Babu in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)",

The one-year LPR is loosely pegged off the medium-term lending facility (MLF) and market participants typically see changes in the MLF rate as a precursor to adjustments in the LPR.\nThe PBOC injected 1.45 trillion yuan worth of one-year MLF loans into the banking system last week but kept the rates on those loans unchanged.\nThe liquidity boost resulted in a net 600 billion yuan of cash injections into the banking system, the biggest monthly increase since December 2016.\n\"Policymakers may want more time to access the impact of the recent repricing of existing mortgage contracts before they make further changes to the benchmark rate,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, said in a note released before the LPR fixing.\n\"The big picture though is that, with economic momentum weak and downward pressure on the renminbi reversing, we think rate reductions will come before long,\" he said, expecting China to lower the lending benchmark by 20 basis points at the end of the first quarter next year.\nChina's yuan has clawed back some of its year-to-date losses after losing more than 6% against the dollar at one point in September.\nChina remains an outlier among global central banks, having loosened monetary policy to shore up a faltering recovery but further rate cuts would widen the yield gap with the United States, risking yuan depreciation and capital outflows.\nThe LPR, which banks normally charge their best clients, is set by 18 designated commercial banks who submit proposed rates to the central bank every month.\n(Reporting by Winni Zhou and Tom Westbrook.

CEO Jack Fusco said the company was \"confident in achieving full year 2023 results at the high end of guidance ranges.\"\nCheniere posted revenue of $4.2 billion for the third quarter, compared with $8.9 billion a year earlier. The company said the fall in revenue was due to lower gas pricing at the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark.\nU.S. gas prices were down about 60% in the July-September quarter versus the same period last year as U.S. production continued to rise and concerns eased over energy security in Europe.\nSeparately, Cheniere said it has entered into an agreement to supply about 0.9 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG to Chinese gas company Foran Energy Group for 20 years.\nDeliveries will commence upon the start of commercial operations of liquefaction Train 8 at Sabine Pass in Louisiana.\nNEW LIQUEFACTION TRAINS COMING\nCheniere has not yet made a final investment decision to add Trains 7-9 at Sabine, but if it decides to do so, the company has agreed to sell about 0.8 MTPA of LNG to European chemical company BASF starting in mid-2026 upon substantial completion of Sabine 7.\nCheniere is the biggest U.S. buyer of gas and the biggest U.S. exporter of LNG with the capacity to produce about 45 MTPA of LNG at Corpus Christi in Texas and Sabine.\nThe company is also building new liquefaction trains at Corpus that will add over 10 MTPA of capacity between 2025-2027, and is developing expansions that could add roughly 20 MTPA at Sabine and 3 MTPA at Corpus.\nCheniere said the Corpus Stage 3 expansion was ahead of schedule and could potentially produce first LNG by the end of 2024.\nCheniere said in its earnings presentation that global LNG imports to Europe in August and September slipped below 2022's highs.\nIn Asia, year-over-year LNG imports in the third quarter were up to China, India and Thailand but down to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.\nLooking ahead, Cheniere expects global LNG demand will grow over 3% per annum through 2040, driven by rising demand in developing Asian economies.\nThat growth will require additional supplies of LNG after 2027, with the supply/demand gap expected to reach about 135 MTPA in 2040, Cheniere said.

        "text": "\nBy Naveen Thukral and Dominique Patton\nSINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is set to import record volumes of wheat this year, trading sources say, with rain damage to its crop and worries over dry weather in exporting nations fuelling Beijing's appetite to buy while prices are low.\nTraders said China's frantic buying is likely to support global prices, which have dropped more than a quarter this year - based on the Chicago futures benchmark price - amid abundant supplies from top exporter Russia.\nThe world's biggest wheat producer and consumer, China bought around two million metric tons of new-crop Australian wheat in October, for shipments starting in December, trading sources told Reuters. It has also booked about 2.5 million metric tons of French wheat since September, for December-March shipment, they said, noting these were unusually large volumes for this time of year.\nOverall, China's 2023 imports are likely to reach around 12 million tons, two Singapore-based traders said, topping 2022's record 9.96 million tons, and the avid buying is expected to continue into 2024.\n\"China has had problems with crop quality this year and Australia, which is the main wheat supplier to China, is going to have a much smaller crop,\" said one of the Singapore traders, who is at an international company which sells wheat to China.\n\"They are buying as much as they can and as early as possible. Supplies are going to eventually tighten, especially from Australia,\" the trader said.\nChina has said its wheat crop shrank 0.9% this year to 134.5 million tons, the first decline in seven years despite expanded acreage, after heavy rain battered mature grain in the key central growing region just before the harvest.\nBeijing has not provided a crop quality assessment.\nHowever, according to estimates by the two Singapore traders and one dealer in Sydney, around 25 million tons or about 20% of China's harvest this year was damaged by rains. Some of that rain-damaged wheat will only be fit for animal feed or for blending with higher quality imported wheat before being milled into flour.\nChina's agriculture ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe world's biggest hog producer, China's Muyuan Foods has benefitted from the availability of rain damaged wheat. Muyuan told investors on Friday that purchases of germinated wheat, which occurs when mature plants get wet and can no longer be used for milling, contributed significantly to lowering production costs.\n\"Australia has the opportunity to fill the quality gap that China is currently suffering, particularly for high protein milling wheat,\" said Stefan Meyer, a grains broker at StoneX in Sydney.\nWhile wheat output in Australia, the world's second largest exporter, is forecast to drop to 26 million metric tons, down from last season's record 39.7 million tons, due to dryness from the El Nino weather pattern, the quality is better this year as dry weather results in higher protein content.\nMa Wenfeng, senior analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultancy, said a lower share of China's wheat harvest - about 20 million tons - was unsuitable for high-quality milling, although a portion of it can be used after cleaning.\nMa and others in China said attractive prices were a bigger driver of China's imports.\n\"Price is the main reason - it's really cheap,\" said Rosa Wang, analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd, adding that\nChina was probably looking at the mounting weather risks in top exporting countries and \"making preparations\" for next year.\nMORE TO COME\nChina's January-September wheat imports jumped 53.6% to 10.17 million metric tons, customs data showed, including 6.4 million tons from Australia and 1.8 million tons from Canada. Those figures don't reflect orders made for future delivery, such as recent purchases of U.S. soft red winter wheat.\nUnlike other commodities, China's imports of Australian wheat were largely unaffected by the bilateral tensions between the two governments in recent years. Indeed, those tensions have eased in recent months.\nBeijing's heavy buying from Australia could force rival importers such as Indonesia and Japan to seek alternatives from North America and the Black Sea region, traders said.\nChinese wheat purchases have stabilised global wheat prices, one of the Singapore traders said.\n\"But we expect prices to rise going forward, when China starts taking more volumes of higher quality wheat from the U.S. as Australian supplies are going to tighten,\" the trader said.\nGiven lower output in Australia, traders and analysts said China is likely to import significantly higher volumes of French wheat in the coming months.\n\"With the U.S. having a slightly larger spring wheat crop, a type of wheat that can very much act as an 'improver' supply for many importers, we would not be surprised to see China seek some U.S. and maybe Canadian Spring wheat,\" said Jeffrey McPike, a U.S. analyst with brokerage WASDEA Commodities.\n(Reporting by Naveen Thukral and Dominique Patton; additional reporting by Peter Hobson in Canberra, Gus Trompiz in Paris and Julie Ingwersen in Chicago; Editing by Tony Munroe & Simon Cameron-Moore)",

White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the Chinese minister would also meet with Sullivan and Blinken on Friday. She said they would address challenging issues, including misperceptions and miscommunications, and ways they can work together.\nU.S. officials are keen for Beijing to use its influence with Iran and other countries in the Middle East to help prevent the conflict there from spreading.\nAnalysts said that while China had expressed concern about the\nU.S. approach\nto the conflict, the two sides share a common interest in avoiding a wider regional war.\n\"That might be a basis for some common ground, even if China likely sees some benefits to the hit the United States is taking in the region among its Arab partners,\" said Dalia Dassa Kaye, a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations.\nHowever, she said Beijing's actual leverage could be limited, while others questioned Beijing's willingness to use it.\nJon Alterman, head of the Middle East program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said China, as a major oil consumer, certainly has an interest in preventing a direct U.S.-Iranian confrontation as it would spike oil prices.\n\"Still, the Chinese are unlikely to do any heavy lifting here,\" he said. \"I expect they'll want a seat at the table when the Israel-Gaza struggle gets resolved, but they don\u2019t feel much need or ability to hasten resolution.\"\nIsrael's bombing and siege of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks has stirred anger in Muslim-majority countries, and Washington fears an imminent ground offensive could spark a wider conflict.\nChina has consistently called for restraint and a ceasefire in response to Israel's bombardment of Gaza, but has also sharpened its criticism of Israel.

The 58-year-old\u2019s family fears he is dying.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be saying that Dr. Yang\u2019s case needs to be resolved and I\u2019ll be speaking about his human rights, the nature of the detention and the failure to have transparent processes,\u201d Albanese told reporters in the northern Australian city of Darwin hours before he flew to Shanghai.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry this week defended Yang\u2019s prosecution, saying his case had been handled in strict accordance with the law.\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that Albanese arrived in the Chinese financial hub Saturday afternoon along with his delegation, becoming the first Australian prime minister to visit China since 2016. The visit signals an improvement in strained relations between the two nations since Australia\u2019s center-left government was elected last year.\n\"It\u2019s very good to be here,\u201d he told Australian reporters on the tarmac. \u201cI look forward to the visit.\u201d\nHe was greeted by China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, and Australia\u2019s ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher. Albanese was handed a bouquet of flowers by a young girl.\nAlbanese has been raising the plights of Yang and another detained Australian, journalist Cheng Lei, with Chinese leaders since he first met Xi on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Indonesia a year ago.\nCheng was freed and deported last month after three years in a Beijing detention for breaking a government-imposed embargo by a few minutes. Her release was interpreted as a Chinese concession ahead of Albanese\u2019s visit.\nAlbanese is to meet on Tuesday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, whose message of congratulations soon after the prime minister\u2019s election victory on May 21 last year raised the prospects of a reset in bilateral relations.\nBeijing has previously refused top-level ministerial contacts between the two countries.\nFrom the outset of his prime ministership, Albanese had demanded that China immediately lift what he described as \u201cunjustified\u201d official and unofficial trade barriers costing Australian exporters 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year.\nThose barriers have since been substantially reduced and now cost around AU$2 billion ($1.3 billion).\nAlbanese on Saturday credited his government\u2019s different approach toward China for what he describes as \u201cstabilizing\u201d the relationship, after nine years of conservative rule in Australia.\n\u201cMy approach towards this relationship has been patient, deliberate and measured, making sure that both of our interests are put forward because that is the way that good diplomacy works,\u201d Albanese said.\n\u201cThe fact that it is the first visit in seven years to our major trading partner is a very positive step, and I look forward to constructive discussions and dialogue with the president and the premier during my visit to Shanghai and Beijing,\u201d he added.\nChina is concerned by the level of restrictions placed on Chinese investment in Australia due to growing security concerns.\nAround 400 Australian executives who do business with China are expected to attend a lunch with Albanese in Shanghai on Sunday. Many urge Australia to ease restrictions on Chinese investment.\n\u201cChinese investment shouldn\u2019t be a dirty word,\u201d David Olsson, president of the Australia China Business Council, told The Australian Financial Review newspaper.\nAlbanese will visit Shanghai to attend the opening of the China International Import Expo trade fair where more than 200 Australian companies will be represented.\nDuring the three-day visit, Albanese will focus on reinvigorating the China-Australia free trade agreement, resolving the remaining Chinese trade bans and finding agreement on how to settle future trade disputes, his office said.\nTrade Minister Don Farrell, Foreign Minister Penny Wong and an Australian business delegation are traveling with him.\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest export market, particularly for iron ore, natural gas and critical minerals such as lithium.\nAlbanese has signaled that Australia won\u2019t back China\u2019s bid to join the free trade agreement known as the 12-nation Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.",

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- China is overhauling the way it lends to developing nations, a strategy that may help their largest official creditor maintain a narrowing lead over the US and its Group of Seven allies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWeWork Goes Bankrupt, Signs Pact With Creditors to Cut Debt\nTrump Testimony Called a \u2018Broken Record\u2019 by Judge: Trial Update\nTrump's Wealth Has Jumped $500 Million Since He Left the White House\nTrump Shouts at Judge and Lawyers in Wild Day on Witness Stand\nIsrael Latest: Netanyahu Sees a Role in Gaza Security After War\nBeijing has begun moving away from the big bilateral deals it was eager to strike a decade ago \u2014 when it first launched its flagship Belt and Road Initiative that mainly lends to infrastructure projects \u2014 in favor of collaborative lending that reduces its exposure to financial risk, according to a new report published by AidData at William and Mary, a public university in Virginia.\nThe result is a moderate pullback in spending, though China still beats G7 countries. The Asian nation in 2021 provided aid and loans worth $79 billion to low- and middle-income nations, more than the $61 billion provided by the US, according to the latest available data from AidData. The World Bank that year made commitments worth around $53 billion.\nCompare that to the period between 2013 and 2017, when Beijing averaged around $117 billion each year in financing to developing countries \u2014 an amount that outpaced Washington\u2019s spending nearly three-to-one, the report said. That\u2019s a lot higher than previously thought.\nA lot has changed in the decade since President Xi Jinping launched Belt and Road. As several recipients of its funding declare sovereign default, Beijing has faced accusations of being an irresponsible lender. Xi\u2019s close diplomatic relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and geopolitical tensions with the West have added to strains, contributing to waning interest from Europe in the Belt and Road program.\nThose issues \u2014 coupled with an economic slowdown at home \u2014 may be forcing China to rethink its approach to lending as it seeks to maintain its financial influence within the developing world.\n\u201cChina is not going to stand by and watch its flagship global infrastructure initiative crash and burn. That\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d said Brad Parks, the executive director of AidData and lead author of the report. \u201cBeijing is effectively on a rescue mission. It is kind of scanning its global portfolio and it\u2019s firefighting in response to crises.\u201d\nCautious Approach\nChina\u2019s more cautious approach comes down in part to the financial problems faced by many of the countries that borrowed from the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nAround 80% of Beijing\u2019s lending to the developing world goes to supporting nation in financial distress, according to AidData. The researcher\u2019s database covers some $1.34 trillion in financial instruments across 165 countries from 2000 to 2021. That includes some projects committed to in that time frame that may not have been started until this year.\nParks pointed to some recalculations that suggest a change to China\u2019s view in the long term, for which it has set up new loan and project safeguards. The country has started to outsource its risk analysis to international institutions like the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank\u2019s private sector arm. It\u2019s also investing via syndicated loans led by western commercial banks.\nThat\u2019s made China a far more efficient lender and investor in projects in the developing world, according to AidData. While it\u2019s using western institutions to make that happen, most of the projects the country is investing in are still being built by Chinese contractors.\nThe report also noted a shift in the structure of deals Beijing is pursuing. Half of China\u2019s non-emergency lending portfolio in low- and middle-income countries is now provided via syndicated loan arrangements. More than 80% of those involve Western commercial banks and multilateral institutions, according to AidData.\n\u201cBeijing is behaving like a yield-maximizing investment portfolio manager,\u201d Parks and the other authors of the report wrote, adding that the country\u2019s efforts to derisk have been \u201cpoorly understood\u201d by policymakers in Western capitals. \u201cWashington, London, and Brussels increasingly run the risk of competing with a version of the BRI that no longer exists.\u201d\nRisks Remain\nA recalibration of its approach to lending doesn\u2019t protect Beijing from reputational risks. The US and Europe have grown increasingly wary of China\u2019s influence in recent years, resulting in efforts to curtail Beijing\u2019s ambitions on everything from technology to electric vehicles.\nRising geopolitical stress has spurred some countries to reconsider whether working with China on Belt and Road or other programs is worth the effort. Italy, the sole G7 member to join China\u2019s flagship initiative, is set to exit the program by the end of the year. The Philippines said last month it would no longer pursue Chinese funding for three railway projects amid tensions in the South China Sea.\nBeijing\u2019s public approval rating in the developing world plunged from 56% in 2019 to 40% in 2021, the AidData report said, citing Gallup World Poll data.\nDescribing Chinese lending \u201cas a debt trap is just smears,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said during a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday in response to a question on the AidData report. \u201cChina will appear in countries and at a time when Western, developed countries would not like to appear,\u201d he added.\nDespite challenges, China may still be able to hang onto its lead as a lender to the developing world as it refines its new strategy, according to Parks. He also stressed one crucial advantage the West has yet to match: Beijing is much faster at delivering projects.\n\u201cSpeed is everything\u201d for leaders of developing nations who want to build infrastructure said Parks, adding that Western development banks can take more than a decade to deliver projects that China\u2019s capable of in three years. He and the other researchers added that Washington faces difficulty competing \u201cdollar-for-dollar\u201d with Beijing, meaning they must carefully select the places that will give them the greatest return.\n\u201cUnless or until the G7 addresses that issue frontally,\u201d Parks said, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be at a comparative disadvantage vis-a-vis Beijing.\u201d\n--With assistance from Tom Hancock and James Mayger.\n(Updates with Beijing\u2019s response to the AidData report.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nWho\u2019s Ready for a Trump-Biden Rematch?

        "text": "\nELLWOOD CITY, Pa. (AP) \u2014 When a health care startup dreamed of building a network of rural hospitals several years ago, it turned to Jim Biden.\nAlthough he wasn\u2019t a public health consultant or a medical expert, Jim Biden was the brother of Joe Biden, who had recently finished his term as vice president. The company's chief executive believed Jim Biden would help provide the enterprise with \u201cserious horsepower.\"\nBut Jim Biden wasn\u2019t the secret weapon that Americore Health Services was counting on. The company imploded in 2019, filing for bankruptcy amid a pile of lawsuits and a federal investigation into fraud allegations. Americore also accused Jim Biden of failing to repay $600,000 in loans.\nSome of the Florida-based company\u2019s hospitals closed, including one in Ellwood City, near the western edge of Pennsylvania, where medical equipment gathers dust and plywood covers broken windows. The only reminder of the bankrupt company\u2019s brief tenure as the town\u2019s biggest employer is a plaque honoring its donation to a nearby high school athletic field.\nThe fallout has extended to Washington, where Republicans are hunting for evidence that could be used to impeach Democratic President Joe Biden. It\u2019s a playbook that they\u2019ve already used on Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, whose checkered history includes controversial overseas deal-making, accusations of tax evasion and a well-publicized struggle with addiction.\nRepublicans have not uncovered evidence directly tying the president to any wrongdoing. But his brother and son make attractive twin targets, having been close for decades and facing accusations of leveraging their last name into corporate paydays. House Republicans subpoenaed them on Wednesday as part of their investigation into a complicated web of transactions and relationships within the Biden family.\nThe latest focus has been on a series of payments that Republicans claim show the president benefited from his brother's work, including more than $600,000 that Americore sent Jim Biden when the company was struggling to stay afloat.\nRepublicans have highlighted a $200,000 personal check from Jim to Joe Biden on the same day \u2014 March 1, 2018 \u2014 that Jim Biden received an equal amount from Americore.\nHouse Democrats point to bank records they say indicate Jim Biden was repaying a loan provided by his brother, who had wire transferred $200,000 to him about six weeks earlier. The money changed hands while Joe Biden was a private citizen, after his stint as vice president and before announcing his successful White House bid.\n\u201cThere is nothing more to those transactions, and there is nothing wrong with them,\u201d said Paul Fishman, an attorney representing Jim Biden. \u201cAnd Jim Biden has never involved his brother in his business dealings.\u201d\nHe accused Republicans of pursuing \u201can unnecessary and intrusive review of Jim\u2019s private banking records.\u201d\nWhite House spokesman Ian Sams said \u201cextreme House Republicans won\u2019t let the truth get in the way of abusing their power to conduct a smear campaign against the president.\u201d\nJim Biden last year repaid Americore $350,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by the company\u2019s court-appointed trustee. His lawyers for that proceeding said he played no role in the company\u2019s collapse and all the money he received was for his consulting work, not loans, as the trustee had alleged.\nBiden\u2019s political adversaries have vowed to press forward with their investigations as an election year approaches.\nRep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, said he\u2019s \u201ctroubled that Joe Biden\u2019s ability to recoup funds depend on his brother\u2019s cashing in on the Biden brand.\u201d\nComer, R-Ky., is also scrutinizing a daisy chain of transactions beyond those involving Americore. The lawmaker claims records show that Joe Biden benefited from \u201claundered China money\u201d when Hunter and Jim Biden began working with a politically connected Chinese energy company in 2017.\nJim Biden's wife, Sara, cut a personal check to Joe Biden for $40,000 on Sept. 3, 2017, which came weeks after a payment from Chinese interests.\nHouse Democrats said bank records show Joe Biden had wired $40,000 to his brother a little more than a month earlier, suggesting that the subsequent check was to repay a loan.\nRepresentatives for Joe and Jim Biden did not provide explanations for the loans, which were made during a lucrative intermission in the president\u2019s career as an elected official. In the two years after leaving the vice presidency, Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, made $15 million in book deals, speaking fees and university work.\nJim Biden\u2019s varied career has included stints working as a nightclub owner, selling health and pension benefit services to labor unions and working for a construction company seeking contracts in the Middle East. Last year he said he was looking to purchase a professional rugby franchise in Philadelphia. Jim Biden also has a checkered financial history that includes lawsuits over unpaid bills, trouble with mortgage payments and liens for unpaid federal, state and municipal taxes, court and land records show.\nConcerns that Jim Biden\u2019s business ventures and missteps would cloud Joe Biden\u2019s political career stretch back decades.\nAfter Joe Biden was elected to the Senate in 1972, Jim Biden ran a Delaware nightclub called Seasons Change that eventually shut down with roughly $600,000 in unpaid debts, according to local newspapers.\nJim Biden received some loans for the club because officials at one bank believed that his last name \u201cwould attract a trendy free-spending crowd,\u201d the Delaware News Journal reported in 1977. One of the officials tried to pressure Jim Biden to repay the money by telling him that delinquency could embarrass his brother.\nAccording to a newspaper interview that the bank\u2019s chairman gave at the time, Joe Biden angrily called to complain. \u201cLook,\u201d the senator said, \u201cwhatever goes on with my brother, it\u2019s his problem, and don\u2019t bring my name into it.\u201d\nJim Biden's personal financial troubles played a role in his brother's decision to quit his first presidential campaign in 1988, according to the book \u201cWhat It Takes.\"\nAnd his ties to lawyers entangled in a Mississippi bribery scheme became a target for Republicans in the 2008 race, when Joe Biden was Barack Obama\u2019s running mate.\nThe negative publicity doesn't seem to have driven a wedge between the brothers, and the president tapped Jim Biden to pick out furnishings for the Oval Office. He also attended a state dinner at the White House honoring Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June.\nJoe and Jim Biden's lives have been intertwined in ways that transcend the typical closeness between siblings. The president is the oldest of four children, followed by his sister Valerie, Jim and youngest brother Frank. Their father was a used car salesman and their mother a homemaker, and they were often strapped for cash while growing up.\nJim Biden left the University of Delaware without graduating and raised money for his brother\u2019s first Senate campaign. After the 1972 election, Joe Biden\u2019s wife and baby daughter were killed in a car accident. His sons, Beau and Hunter, were badly injured. Jim Biden converted the garage of his brother's house into an apartment, helping with the boys in Delaware as the new senator shuttled back and forth to Washington.\nIn an interview last year with Internal Revenue Service agents investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s taxes, Jim Biden referred to his nephew as his \u201cbest friend.\u201d A memo summarizing the interview was released by House Republicans.\nHunter was similarly effusive in his memoir, \u201cBeautiful Things,\u201d describing how his uncle brought him to rehab in California when he battled addiction to alcohol and crack cocaine following the 2015 death of Beau Biden to brain cancer.\n\u201cDad knew that if his younger brother asked me to do something, I\u2019d do it,\u201d Hunter recalled in his memoir. \u201cUncle Jim has his own superpower: he gets things done. So he jumped on a plane to Los Angeles, pulled me out of a room in the Hollywood Roosevelt, and said, \u2018I found a place. Let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d\nThe uncle and nephew have also been in business with each other. Some deals fizzled, such as a disastrous purchase of a hedge fund, while others were lucrative, like consulting for CEFC China Energy.\nRecords released by House Republicans show more than $1 million in payments linked to the Chinese firm were paid to Jim Biden\u2019s company.\nBut even when Jim Biden was making money, he struggled to stay solvent. In September 2017 he was sued by American Express over a $65,000 unpaid credit card bill. Court records show the matter was dropped, and Jim Biden's representatives said the bill was paid.\nIn early 2018, Jim Biden sold a Florida vacation home for about $1 million less than what he had paid for it a few years earlier after it was damaged by Hurricane Irma. Last year he was hit with a $16,000 state tax lien in Pennsylvania, which was paid off a month later, according to local court records.\nRepublicans remain interested in what transpired with Americore, referencing payments from the company when writing that they\u2019ve \u201cuncovered evidence that President Biden directly benefited from Jim Biden\u2019s attempts to peddle influence.\u201d\nIt is not clear how Americore connected with Jim Biden. Tom Pritchard, a former company executive, said he immediately doubted Jim Biden's value to the startup.\nThe executive was perplexed that Jim Biden insisted on decorating his office with expensive furniture even as the company was losing money. And Jim Biden always seemed more interested in selling the image of a political insider than doing the hard work necessary to save the firm, Pritchard said.\n\u201cHe was definitely going for the presidential look,\u201d Pritchard said in describing how Jim Biden displayed signed photos of his brother and Obama in his office.\nHe added that Jim Biden \u201cwanted to do as little as possible and reap the maximum benefits.\u201d\nFishman, the attorney representing Jim Biden, defended Jim Biden's contributions to the company, saying he \"worked diligently to identify investors, strategic partners and business opportunities for Americore.\u201d\nPritchard said Jim Biden promised to leverage his brother\u2019s clout to attract investment from the Middle East, as well as to win contracts to conduct laboratory work for unions and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.\nIn the end, the cash infusion from such countries as Qatar and Saudi Arabia never arrived. Instead, Jim Biden helped land a bridge loan for the company, according to court records. The money, more than $19 million, was from a South Florida money manager, Michael Lewitt, with whom he had started a separate venture around the same time.\nJim Biden and Lewitt\u2019s company, Platinum Global Partners, listed as its address a small Delray Beach, Florida, body shop specializing in foreign car repairs, according to corporate registry records. It was dissolved in July 2020, barely 16 months after it was created.\nLast month, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Lewitt in a civil lawsuit of defrauding investors, many of them older people, who were told their savings would be used to purchase Wall Street securities \u2014 not funneled to Americore, an unlisted, unprofitable company. Lewitt, the fund\u2019s sole manager, is accused of taking $4.7 million for himself. Lewitt did not respond to a request for comment.\nJim Biden was not named in the suit, and Fishman said he is not under investigation.\nPritchard said Biden\u2019s promises helped Americore persuade skeptical residents in small towns to embrace the company's takeovers. That was especially true, Pritchard said, in Ellwood City, where the hospital, like the old steel mill town, had been declining for decades.\nAt a hearing before a local judge in August 2017 to approve the sale, Americore\u2019s president, Grant White, invoked Jim Biden\u2019s involvement as he spoke emotionally about the company\u2019s plans.\n\u201cSo when you say what\u2019s our motivation, why are people like Jim Biden, who could do many other things with his life, why am I doing this instead of investment banking and making a few bucks?\u201d White said with Jim Biden nearby in the courtroom. \u201cBecause this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to actually make a difference.\u201d\nAmericore\u2019s collapse has left bitterness in Ellwood City, a traditionally blue-collar Democratic town won by then-Republican President Donald Trump in 2020.\nAt the same time the company was bleeding cash, Jim Biden received $600,000 that former workers believed could have been directed to the struggling hospital.\nWithin two years of Americore acquiring the facility, the company capped paychecks at $500 and the emergency room\u2019s CT scanner broke. Just days before Christmas in 2019, the last of the hospital\u2019s roughly 200 employees were laid off.\nScott Paglia, a respiratory therapist who worked at the hospital for two decades, remains angry over what happened. He blames Jim Biden for profiting from his hometown\u2019s misfortune and suspects Americore was intent on fraud from the outset.\n\u201cHow do these people get away with this?\u201d asked Paglia. But he\u2019s also angry at Jim Biden's brother.\nThe president, he said, \u201chad to know he was selling the Biden name.\u201d\n___\nSuderman reported from Richmond, Virginia, and Megerian from Washington.

        "text": "\nBy Jamie McGeever\nOct 27 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist.\nAsian markets look to round off a difficult week with a flourish on Friday, but ominous signals from U.S. trading on Thursday - stocks closed in the red again despite a steep decline in bond yields - do not auger well.\nThe conditions for a sharp rebound on Wall Street were in place - third quarter U.S. GDP beat forecasts, and the 'soft landing' narrative was bolstered by some signs of cooling inflation and sharp pullback in yields.\nBut not only did stocks fail to claw back any of Wednesday's heavy losses, they fell almost as much again, pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new lows since May.\nThis is the backdrop to Friday's open in Asia, where Japanese economic data, bonds, and currency will again be under intense scrutiny ahead of next week's Bank of Japan policy meeting.\nThe main data release in Asia on Friday will be consumer price inflation in Tokyo for September. Core consumer inflation in the Japanese capital is expected to have held steady at a 2.5% annual rate in October, according to a Reuters poll, the lowest since July last year.\nThe BOJ next week is set to raise its national core consumer inflation forecast for the fiscal year ending in March 2024 to near 3% from the current 2.5% projection made in July, sources told Reuters.\nThe BOJ is inching closer to ending negative interest rates and phasing out ultra-accommodative monetary policy. Twenty-five of 28 economists polled by Reuters expect no policy change next week, but the remaining three - at Barclays, JP Morgan and UBS - think the BOJ will begin unwinding its easy stance then.\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday called for Japan to make a \"total break\" from its deflationary past, and markets continue to test the BOJ's resolve.\nThe yen on Thursday sank below 150.00 per dollar to its weakest since October 21 last year. The low that particular day near 152 per dollar was the yen's weakest level in 32 years.\nThere has been no yen-supporting intervention to temper the current exchange rate depreciation, but the BOJ has been more active in the bond market, where the 10-year yield hit a decade-high on Thursday at 0.89%.\nIn China, meanwhile, industrial sector profit figures for the first nine months of the year are on the docket Friday.\nYear-to-date profits at China's industrial firms have been falling every month since July last year, and at a double-digit pace every month this year. The good news, however, is the pace of decline has been easing since March.\nChina's main CSI 300 index is flat for the week but down almost 5% this month, while the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is down 1.75% and 4.5%, respectively.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday:\n- Tokyo CPI inflation (September)\n- China industrial profits (Sept, YTD)\n- Australia producer price inflation (Q3)\n(By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",

        "text": "\n(Changes sourcing, adds details on portfolio, background)\nBy Svea Herbst-Bayliss\nNEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Jeff Ubben, one of Wall Street's most prominent activist investors, is shutting down Inclusive Capital Partners three years after starting the firm designed to focus on social investing.\nUbben told investors in a memo he was winding down some funds and returning capital, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\nUbben and Inclusive Capital, known as InCap, did not respond to calls and emails for comment.\nThe closure of InCap comes as hedge funds struggle to raise new cash, and as a number of prominent investors have been wrong-footed by markets gyrating on speculation about interest rate moves, fears about inflation and geopolitical turmoil.\nLast year more hedge funds closed their doors than launched, data from Hedge Fund Research show.\nMore than two decades ago, Ubben, 61, who started his career at mutual fund giant Fidelity, founded ValueAct Capital in San Francisco. Since 2000 he established himself and the firm as a powerful but friendly investor more interested in working behind the scenes with target companies than pushing for change in public on television or at conferences.\nValueAct, which invested as much as $20 billion over the years, took stakes in companies ranging from Microsoft to Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, and a handful of its top executives, including Ubben, sat on numerous corporate boards.\nAfter having spent years planning for an orderly succession at ValueAct and at an age many investors might think of retiring, Ubben launched InCap in 2020.\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that InCap is returning capital to investors.\nThe firm was designed as an environmental and social impact investor that would put money into companies whose businesses address societal needs. At the time, Ubben said pushing firms to address environmental and social issues could have big payoffs and the firm was trying to raise as much as $10 billion.\nIn 2021, InCap invested in Exxon and Ubben joined the board as the oil company was facing a board challenge from startup hedge fund Engine No. 1.\nInvestors voted to replace three directors with Engine No. 1 candidates but Ubben kept his seat.\nIn a regulatory filing, InCap said on Wednesday it was selling two million shares in Exxon worth $216 million, suggesting the firm was making big changes to its portfolio.\nDespite Ubben's strong reputation, people familiar with InCap's fund raising efforts said it has been tough to raise cash and noted that investor tastes, especially when it came to environmental, social and governance issues (ESG), have shifted. With markets tumbling last year, many investors simply wanted to see returns instead of focusing on ESG issues.\nAdditionally some of InCap's public investments have lost money, people familiar with the portfolio said, noting that there where also winners and some private investments that buoyed the portfolio.\nThis year a handful of the firm's biggest investments, including specialty chemicals company Ingevity, Bio Rad Laboratories, Unifi Inc which manufactures and sells recycled products, wood pellets maker Enviva and German pharmaceutical and biotech Bayer are nursing double digit losses.\nA number of prominent hedge fund managers who have returned capital to outside investors over the last years, including John Paulson and Louis Bacon, have continued to invest their own fortunes through family office structures.

It targets mutations in certain proteins in the body that lead to unchecked cell growth.\nThe FDA approval is based on data from a trial in which the oral drug was given to cancer patients who had previously received treatment with another TKI, and those who had not, the company said.\nIn the study, the treatment helped shrink or reduce tumor in 79% of patients who had not previously received any TKI treatment and in 38% of patients who were previously treated with a drug from the same class.\nBristol Myers previously said it expects the drug to become a standard-of-care therapy for certain patients with NSCLC, a lucrative market for drug developers.

U.S. rate futures were pricing in a 33% chance of a rate cut in March, rising to a roughly 65% probability in May, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Those odds were at 21% and roughly 50% late on Monday. The dollar extended losses after Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a hawkish policymaker, flagged a possible rate cut in the months ahead. If the decline in inflation continues \"for several more months ... three months, four months, five months ... we could start lowering the policy rate just because inflation is lower,\" he said. The dollar index, which measures its value against six major currencies, fell as far as 102.60, the lowest since mid-August. It was last down 0.3% at 102.82. The index is on track for a loss of 3.6% in November, its worst performance since November 2022. \"The dollar bounced over the summer, with the help of divergence -- the outperformance of the U.S. economy. Now the dollar is weakening on the new convergence,\" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist, at Bannockburn Forex in New York. \"It's not that Europe or China is looking much better. But they're slowing down and the U.S. looks like it's slowing down.\" Tuesday's U.S. data, however, showed mixed results. U.S. consumer confidence rose in November after three straight monthly declines, a survey showed. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased to 102.0 this month from a downwardly revised 99.1 in October. At the same time, U.S. annual home price growth accelerated again in September. Home prices were up 6.1% on a year-over-year basis, up from an upwardly revised 5.8% increase in August. However, the Richmond Fed manufacturing index dropped into negative territory at -5 in November. In other currencies, the euro rose to a 3-1/2-month peak of $1.1009. It last changed hands at $1.0981, up 0.3%. Sterling also gained, climbing to its highest since Sept. 1. The pound was last up 0.4% at $1.2685. Traders are now eyeing the U.S. core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Fed's preferred measure of inflation - this week for more confirmation that inflation is slowing. PCE tops off a slew of other key economic events this week, including flash inflation data from major euro zone economies, with bloc-wide data due Thursday, Chinese purchasing managers' index (PMI) data and an OPEC+ decision on crude output. The dollar fell 0.8% to 147.49 yen, with the Japanese currency continuing its recovery from the brink of 152 per dollar earlier in the month. The dollar also slid 0.2% to 0.8762 Swiss francs, its lowest level since the start of September, and the Australian dollar briefly touched a near four-month high of US$0.6665. The New Zealand dollar hit its highest since August at US$0.6147. It was last at US$0.6127, up 0.5%. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, where it is expected to keep interest rates steady at 5.50% for the fourth straight time.

        "text": "\nMacKenzie Scott is the gift that keeps on giving\u2014literally. The billionaire ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has made it her mission to offload much of the fortune she gained from their divorce, and lately she\u2019s focused on combating the affordable housing crisis in California.\nIn the latest of her string of donations to California-based affordable housing nonprofit organizations, Scott made an \u201cunexpected gift\u201d of $15 million to Culver City, Calif.-based Century Housing, which finances, builds, and operates multi-family rental housing throughout the state. In September, Scott had also made an $8 million gift to San Francisco-based BRIDGE Housing and a $20 million donation to the San Francisco Community Land Trust.\nThis latest donation came as rent almost completely eats the earnings of many Southern California residents. As of July, the average monthly rent for a Los Angeles apartment is more than $2,700 according to RentCafe, an internet listing service for rental properties. That\u2019s nearly 60% the average monthly earnings of a U.S. adult, CEIC data shows.\n\u201cOur work is more urgent than ever as rents continue to rise, putting more Californians at risk of housing instability, including groups like the working poor and seniors,\u201d a Century Housing spokesperson tells Fortune. \u201cWe will use this remarkable gift to increase the supply of affordable housing in SoCal through our investments and developments, working with our many partners to provide housing security for more residents\u2014and to ultimately build more equitable, thriving communities.\u201d\nPlus, buying a home in California is impossible for many people, with only 16% of residents qualifying to purchase a median-priced single-family home during the second quarter of this year, the California Association of Realtors reported in August. And most people can forget about owning a home in San Francisco. The average home price there is more than $1.2 million, according to Zillow, although it\u2019s down by 9% year-over-year.\nCentury Housing historically has supported rental projects for residents who earn an average of 50% of the area median income level (AMI), which equates roughly to rents around 55% of the market rate, the spokesperson says.\nScott\u2019s unrestricted donation will help the organization invest in more affordable housing projects similar to 1064 Mission Street, a permanent supportive housing site in San Francisco, and Red Tail Crossing, a supportive housing project in Los Angeles.\nCentury Housing Corp., the organization\u2019s community development financial wing, also lends to developers of affordable housing for low-income residents and workforce housing for moderate-income residents who typically don\u2019t qualify for subsidized housing, the spokesperson says. One such project is 231 Grant in Palo Alto, Calif., which will offer 110 affordable housing units for Bay Area educators. Also in the works is a 131-unit project in Petaluma, an hour north of San Francisco,, for residents earning at or below 30% to 60% of the area\u2019s median income.\nSince making her Giving Pledge in 2019, Scott has given away more than $14 billion to more than 1,600 non-profit organizations focused on solving a variety of problems, as well as universities, according to the Yield Giving page. Scott\u2019s net worth is still at $38.1 billion, according to Forbes. Her supersized philanthropy has largely been inspired by her \u201cimpulse to help someone,\u201d she wrote in December 2021.\n\u201cIf you think you know how much impact might flow from acting on any of your own impulses to give, you are almost certainly wrong,\u201d Scott wrote. \u201cEach unique expression of generosity will have value far beyond what we can imagine or live to see.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Florida said UK companies account for more than 70,000 jobs in the state, making Britain the top foreign investor, with total holdings estimated at $18 billion.\nBritain has signed similar pacts with six other states and is in negotiations with Texas, California, Colorado and Illinois. Badenoch will meet California Governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday to discuss that memorandum of understanding.\n\"Florida is a major economy in its own right, with a bigger GDP than most European countries,\" Badenoch said. \"From launching satellites to developing the latest fintech software, Florida\u2019s leading high-tech companies offer huge opportunities to the UK\u2019s rapidly expanding tech sector.\" ($1 = 0.8149 pounds) (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Additional reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Edwina Gibbs, Mark Heinrich and Raju Gopalakrishnan)",

OPEC+ said after its last meeting in June that the 2024 output quotas of Angola, Nigeria and Congo were conditional on reviews by outside analysts.\nSunday's meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, known as OPEC+, had been expected to consider further changes to a deal that already limits supply into 2024, according to analysts and OPEC+ sources.\n\"Uncertainty is never good for financial markets, with markets now having to wait longer to get clarity what OPEC+ does next year,\" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.\n\"The postponement of the meeting also shows there are some different views among the group participants.\"\nBrent crude settled down 49 cents a barrel at $81.96, recovering from steep losses earlier of nearly 5% after news that the dispute was linked to African producers, among the smaller exporters in OPEC. That led some investors and analysts to downplay the importance of the issue that caused the delay.\nBrent has fallen from near $98 in late September, pressured by rising supplies and concern about demand and a potential economic slowdown.\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak and Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman agreed to delay the meeting, another OPEC+ source said, citing issues around other producers.\nThe Sunday meeting had been expected to convene in OPEC's Vienna headquarters. OPEC announced the delay in a statement which didn't mention if the group would convene online or in person on Nov. 30, although three delegates said it was expected to be in person in Vienna.\nEXTRA CUTS?\nSeveral analysts have predicted OPEC+ is likely to extend or even deepen oil supply cuts into next year and some, including Helima Croft at RBC Capital, have said Saudi Arabia might ask other members to share the task.\n\"We see some scope for the group to do a deeper reduction,\" Croft said this week.\nBefore the OPEC statement, Bloomberg News reported that the meeting could be delayed for an unspecified period of time, citing delegates who said Saudi Arabia had expressed its dissatisfaction with other members about their output numbers.\nSaudi Arabia, Russia and other OPEC+ members have already pledged oil output cuts of about 5 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 5% of daily global demand, in a series of steps that started in late 2022.\nThis figure includes a 1 million bpd voluntary reduction by Saudi Arabia and a 300,000 bpd cut in Russian oil exports, both of which last until the end of 2023.\n(Reporting by Nadine Awadalla, Nayera Abdalla, Ahmad Ghaddar, Vladimir Soldatkin and Maha El Dahan; Writing and additional reporting by Alex Lawler; Editing by Jason Neely, Mark Potter, Kirsten Donovan and Deepa Babington)",

        "text": "\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Oregon\u2019s largest school district said late Sunday it had reached a tentative agreement with its teachers union and roughly 45,000 students would be back in school Monday after more than three weeks without classes.\nThe agreement must still be voted on by teachers who have been on the picket line since Nov. 1 over issues of pay, class sizes and planning time. It must also be approved by the school board, but the union agreed that classes could resume while those votes go forward. Portland Public Schools students missed 11 days of school before the district began its weeklong Thanksgiving break.\n\u201cWe are relieved to have our students returning to school and know that being out of school for the last three weeks \u2014 missing classmates, teachers and learning \u2014 has been hard for everyone,\u201d Superintendent Guadalupe Guerrero said in a statement.\nThe teachers' union said the tentative deal was a big win for teachers and students alike in areas of classroom size, teachers salaries, health and safety and mental health supports for children still struggling from the pandemic. Students will make up missed school days by cutting a week off winter break and adding days in the new year.\n\u201cThis contract is a watershed moment for Portland students, families, and educators\u201d said Portland Teachers Association President Angela Bonilla. \u201cEducators have secured improvements on all our key issues. ... Educators walked picket lines alongside families, students, and allies - and because of that, our schools are getting the added investment they need.\u201d\nThe deal would provide educators with a 13.8% cumulative cost-of-living increase over the next three years and about half of all educators would earn an extra 10.6% from yearly step increases, PPS said. The agreement would also add classroom time for elementary and middle grades starting next year and increase teacher planning time by 90 minutes each week for elementary and middle-aged classrooms.\nThe district would also triple the number of team members dedicated to supporting students' mental and emotional health.\nStudents last attended school on Halloween.\nMany parents were supportive of the striking teachers, but as the school closures dragged on, some raised concerns about learning loss among students, especially after the long school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no online instruction during the strike.\nTensions escalated as talks continued during the Thanksgiving break, with teachers marching on Tuesday across a major bridge and stopping rush-hour traffic for about 15 minutes. One school board member's rental property was vandalized and another had posters taped to his car, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.\nEven celebrities, including several actors who portray beleaguered and underfunded teachers on ABC's hit comedy show \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d posted videos of support on the teachers union's Facebook.\nThe Portland Association of Teachers, which represents more than 4,000 educators, said it was the first teachers strike in the school district. The union has been bargaining with the district for months for a new contract after its previous one expired in June.\nTeachers were angry about growing class sizes, lack of classroom support and planning time, and salaries that haven't kept up with inflation. The annual base salary in the district starts at roughly $50,000.\nPortland Public Schools repeatedly said it didn\u2019t have the money to meet the union\u2019s demands. Oregon lawmakers approved in June a record $10.2 billion K-12 budget for the next two years, but school district representatives said that wasn\u2019t enough. Earlier this month, some state lawmakers held a news conference on the steps of the state Capitol to urge a resolution.\nThe district urged voters in its statement to press state lawmakers for better school funding and said it would have to make budget cuts to afford the concessions to the teachers' union.",

ChatGPT, launched in November 2022, now has 100 million weekly active users, Altman said.\nOpenAI is also pushing for more AI agent-like features to handle personal and work tasks when commanded by a human without close supervision. It will launch a GPT Store later this month where people can share their GPTs - OpenAI's version of agents that will allow ChatGPT to book flights and perform other tasks - and earn money based on the number of users.\n\"GPTs will continue to get more useful and smarter, and you'll eventually be able to let them take on real tasks in the real world,\" OpenAI wrote in a blog on Monday.\n\"We think it's important to move incrementally towards this future, as it will require careful technical and safety work - and time for society to adapt.\"\nEven before event attendees were allowed to check in at 8:30 a.m., hundreds had lined up around the block in the Mid-Market neighborhood in downtown San Francisco. Most are developers already using OpenAI technology, eager for updates.\nFor its 2 million developers, OpenAI announced a new GPT-4 Turbo model and slashed the cost by over 50%. It unveiled assistant application programming interfaces (APIs) with vision and image modalities, confirming a Reuters report. It launched a beta program for developers to fine-tune GPT-4 models.\nOpenAI wants more enterprises and developers to build models to rival those developed by Anthropic and Alphabet's Google, and open source models such as Meta Llama. It also competes for enterprise customers with its own backer, Microsoft.\nTo address data and price concerns of big enterprises, OpenAI launched its Custom Models program, offering a dedicated group of researchers to train custom GPT-4 for them.\nIt matched Google and Microsoft's offers to cover any legal cost incurred by claims around copyright infringement for enterprise users.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu and Anna Tong in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Chang)",

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook assured Wall Street that iPhone demand remains strong in China, blaming Mac and iPad weakness instead. But he also predicted flat December-quarter revenue, suggesting Wall Street won\u2019t see the growth rebound it\u2019s banking on. Shares slid 1.7% at 9:33 a.m. in New York on Friday.\nInvestors have grown skittish about the iPhone\u2019s prospects in China, which accounts for about a fifth of Apple sales and hosts its biggest production base. The country\u2019s consumer economy is reeling, while US businesses face increasing pressure from Beijing as a technology conflict with the US rages. Huawei\u2019s surprise August debut of a smartphone with an advanced made-in-China 5G processor also tapped a vein of patriotism that\u2019s taken sales away from the iPhone.\n\u201cThe challenges that Apple faces in China are unprecedented,\u201d IDC analyst Will Wong said after the results. \u201cIt not only needs to deal with the political tensions and Huawei\u2019s competition but also a different consumer sentiment that is more rational and cautious in spending.\u201d\nApple\u2019s revenue in Greater China declined 2% \u2014 a steeper drop than the companywide figure. There are signs that trend may persist: Initial sales of the iPhone 15 in China were 6% lower than its predecessor in part because of incursions by Huawei, according to the consultancy GfK.\nAside from stronger competition, Apple faces growing risk from political tensions between Washington and Beijing.\nBeijing has expanded a ban on Apple products to state-backed firms and government-backed agencies. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. \u2014 which assembles the majority of Apple\u2019s iPhones from its Chinese factories \u2014 is now under investigation over taxes and land use. Hon Hai, the listed arm of Foxconn Technology Group, and fellow iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp. fell in Taipei on Friday.\nStill, Cook said the iPhone continues to make inroads in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market. Various models accounted for the four top-selling phones in urban China, he said.\n\u201cChina is an incredibly important market,\u201d the CEO said during a post-earnings conference call with analysts. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very optimistic about it.\u201d He didn\u2019t face any direct questions about the situation.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nApple\u2019s conference call did little to ease fears about a potential slowdown of product sales in China, which were notably below consensus at $15 billion, down 2.5% vs. last year, compared with expectations of a 10% increase. Services growth of 16% was the biggest positive surprise, helping to counter weak sales in China, and could be in double digits again in fiscal 1Q. Overall, these results and the 1Q outlook lead us to believe that fiscal 2024 sales growth will likely be about 2% lower than consensus of 5.6%.\n- Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard, BI analysts\nClick here for the full research\nThe iPhone 15 went on sale on Sept. 22 \u2014 only about a week before the quarter ended \u2014 so the latest results only provide an early sense of how the device is doing. Investors will get a clearer picture when Apple reports its holiday results early next year.\nIf the overall China smartphone market is contracting \u2014 as analysts have said \u2014 Apple\u2019s results suggest that it\u2019s winning market share, Cook said. He also touted that the company is opening a new store in the country this week. It\u2019s coming to Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province and will be the company\u2019s 46th in the region.\nCook was in China last month and said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more excited\u201d about the interactions he had with customers and employees, reiterating Apple\u2019s commitment to manufacturing in the country. Beijing announced its investigation into Foxconn about a week after.\n(Updates with shares in second paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Banks charge retailers when processing debit-card transactions, and the Fed was ordered to limit those costs to a \"reasonable and proportional\" level as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.\nThe fees generated $31.59 billion for lenders in 2021, according to Fed data.\nRetailers and banks have sparred over the fees for years, with merchants complaining they are excessively high and pad bank profits, while financial firms argue retailers have failed to pass savings on to consumers via lower prices on products.\nRetailers, who have pressed the Fed for a lower cap for years, praised the proposal, while vowing to try and push the limit even lower.\n\"Today\u2019s proposed rulemaking signals an end to these outrageous markups,\" said Austen Jensen, executive vice president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents large retailers.\nThe proposal would also trim an added fee that banks can charge from 0.05% of the cost of the transaction to 0.04%. However, the Fed proposed expanding a supplemental fee banks can charge to cover fraud-prevention services from 1 cent per transaction to 1.3 cents per transaction, citing a slight uptick in those costs.\nIn practice, the proposed changes would result in, on average, a 17.7 cent fee on a $50 transaction, down from a 24.5 cent fee currently, according to Fed officials.\nThe Fed also proposed automatically adjusting the cap every two years in response to fresh data.\nRetail consultant Burt Flickinger said the new proposal was \"100% positive\" for retailers.\n\"Swipe fees are the second-highest cost for retailers behind labor but is a cost they get nothing out of,\" said Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, adding the proposal is negative for card issuers.\nShares in credit card companies Visa and Mastercard dipped last week after the Fed announced the meeting to reconsider the cap.\nWalmart is likely to benefit the most, Flickinger said, because it \"serves the highest number of cash- and credit-constrained consumers,\" most of whom have only 1 credit card. He also expects Target, Macy's and Kohl's, to see some upside as consumers switch from their high interest rate co-branded credit cards to debit and cash.\nBringing down the cap will also help retailers servicing the agricultural and construction sectors where farmers and ranchers, for example, tend to make more purchases with debit cards and cash than credit. Tractor Supply, Menards, Home Depot, Lowe's and Meijer are among chains likely to benefit, Flickinger said.\nThe retailers were not immediately available to comment.\nIn a letter to the Fed sent Friday, nine major bank trade groups said retailers don't pass on to consumers savings and that claims they would do so in the future \"should be viewed with robust skepticism.\"\nAnalysts said that it is likely the Fed could face a legal challenge from either industry as it considers a new cap.\nTD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note the Fed \"likely expects both the banks and the merchants to challenge any final...rule even if that final proposal simply ratifies the status quo.\" (Reporting by Pete Schroeder and Siddharth Cavale; Editing by Michelle Price, Aurora Ellis and Rod Nickel)",

He is also seeking to simplify decision-making, cutting management positions.\nMarkus Manns, a portfolio manager at Union Investment in Germany, said Anderson now faced \"Herculean\" challenges.\n\"Removing asundexian from our model suggests significant challenges ahead for the company's pharma business,\" Barclays analysts said, adding this was a total surprise.\nBLOW TO US EXPANSION HOPES\nBayer said it would further analyse the data of the discontinued trial, known as OCEANIC-AF, which was initiated in August 2022 with a targeted 18,000 participants. The trial's safety data was consistent with previous studies, it added.\nIt said the independent trial supervisors recommended the continuation of a separate smaller phase III trial, OCEANIC-STROKE, testing asundexian to prevent strokes in participants who have already suffered one.\nBoth OCEANIC studies combined would have involved up to 30,000 patients, Bayer has said.\nThe trial halt is also a blow for the head of Bayer's pharmaceutical unit Stefan Oelrich, who had pinned hopes of a major expansion in the United States - by far the world's largest pharmaceutical market - on asundexian.\nIn contrast to the Xarelto franchise, where Bayer shared development costs with Johnson & Johnson and ceded most of the U.S. market to its partner, Bayer opted to go it alone on asundexian studies and was ready to spend heavily on U.S. marketing and distribution.\nUnion Investment's Manns said the development costs should have been shared.\n\"How asundexian was handled is another example of failed risk management at Bayer,\" he said, adding that Bayer was now lacking sustainable growth prospects.\nThe compound belongs to a novel drug group known as factor XI inhibitors, which has attracted Novartis, working with private equity firm Blackstone, and Bristol-Myers Squibb , working with J&J.\nAsundexian is one of four new drug hopefuls that Bayer in January said had combined peak sales potential of more than 12 billion euros.\n($1 = 0.9168 euros)\n(Reporting by Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt and Jose Joseph in Bengaluru; Editing by Miranda Murray, Christopher Cushing and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

They were on track for their biggest one-day yield drop since March.\nIn stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 389.08 points, or 1.17%, to 33,663.66, the S&P 500 gained 62.04 points, or 1.46%, to 4,299.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 176.79 points, or 1.35%, to 13,238.25.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.77% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.71%.\nThe moves follow sharp gains overnight in Japanese stocks.\nIn foreign exchange, the U.S. dollar was broadly lower on the perception that U.S. rate had peaked, raising risk appetite.\nBrad Bechtel, global head of FX, at Jefferies in New York, said the Fed is probably done hiking rates, but he could see the rationale for tightening one more time given the still-resilient U.S. economy.\n\"But at the same time, everyone is looking at a slowdown and inflation is going in the right direction,\" Bechtel said.\nMarkets now see a below-20% chance that U.S. rates will rise in December.\nSterling, meanwhile, held firm after the BoE decision. The pound rose as much as 0.6% against the dollar to $1.2225, its highest level in 1-1/2 weeks. It was last up 0.2%.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, was last 0.2% lower at 106.25.\nBitcoin, sometimes traded as a proxy for risk-taking, broke above $35,000 to hit its highest level since May 2022.\nInvestors are keenly awaiting results from Apple, due after the closing bell. Apple, a bellwether for consumer demand and the tech sector, is expected to report a 1% decrease in quarterly revenue.\nAlso, U.S. non-farm payrolls data is due out on Friday.

All of that with a stalled economy, public finances in shambles, and more than 40% of the population living in poverty.\nRead More: Milei Says Argentina Heading for \u2018Shock\u2019 Fiscal Therapy in 2024\nCaputo served as finance chief since the beginning of the Macri administration, when he negotiated a $16.5 billion deal with holdout bondholders, allowing Argentina to return to international capital markets. He later issued a 100-year bond that the government of Alberto Fernandez swapped after defaulting again in 2020. Amid a currency run in 2018, Macri tapped Caputo to take over at the central bank, but he only served for a few months before unexpectedly stepping down amid tensions with the International Monetary Fund.\nPressed during Wednesday\u2019s TV interview, Milei didn\u2019t deny that Caputo would be already participating in meetings between his transition team and IMF staff. A spokesperson for the president-elect declined to comment.\nInvestors will be closely watching who Milei chooses for the complicated economic mission, and whether that person will carry out his more radical campaign promises, including dollarizing the economy and shutting down the central bank.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Which is stronger will tip the balance of the South American country's presidential election on Sunday and may reshape its diplomatic ties, economic future, and the wider region's political fault lines.\nThe country of some 45 million people will vote in the Nov. 19 run-off election between Sergio Massa, currently economy minister for the ruling Peronists, and libertarian outsider Javier Milei. Opinion polls indicate a tight race and a deeply divided electorate.\nOn the ground in Buenos Aires and beyond there is fury with the government, which has presided over inflation racing towards 150% that has pushed two-fifths of the population into poverty. That has weakened Massa and driven the abrupt rise of his right-wing rival.\nUp against this is fear of Milei, a wild-haired former TV pundit whose outspoken and aggressive style has led some to compare him to former U.S. President Donald Trump. He has often appeared at rallies brandishing a chainsaw, a symbol of his plans to slash state spending.\nThe two candidates offer vastly different visions for the future of the country, an important exporter of soy, corn, beef and lithium, the largest debtor to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) globally, and a rising producer of shale oil and gas.\nMilei is a harsh critic of China and other leftist governments he loosely calls \"communists,\" including in Brazil; he wants to dollarize Argentina's embattled economy and shut the central bank; and he opposes abortion.\nMassa, a wheeler-dealer centrist in a left-leaning government, has portrayed himself as a defender of the welfare state and regional trade bloc Mercosur, but has the yoke of his failure to stabilize the economy around his neck.\n\"I am leaning towards Milei,\" said Raquel Pampa, a 79-year-old retiree in Buenos Aires, adding she was tired at what she said was corruption by mainstream politicians.\n\"Money is not going into public works, or putting food on the table of retirees or workers earning a pittance - it's lining the pockets of politicians.\"\nMassa, however, has won over some voters with his criticisms of Milei's \"chainsaw\" economic plan that he says could impact welfare handouts and push up the price of transport, energy bills and healthcare, currently subsidized by the state.\n\"My vote is for Sergio Massa because of the two models that are now under debate, his is the one that basically guarantees me staying alive,\" said Fernando Pedernera, a 51-year-old media sector worker. He also criticized Milei's running-mate for defending Argentina's former military dictatorship.\nLeftist presidents in Brazil, Mexico and Spain have voiced their support of Massa, while Peruvian Nobel Prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa and right-wing former leaders from Chile and Colombia have backed Milei.\n'NOT MY FIRST CHOICE'\nNeither Massa or Milei goes into the second round with a strong mandate. Massa got 37% in the first round in October, while Milei had 30%, though has since won the backing of a key conservative bloc, which could push him over the line if it translates into votes.\nOpinion polls have the pair neck-and-neck, with some favoring Milei and others predicting a win for Massa. Many voters around the country aren't convinced by either.\n\"This Sunday I have already decided that I am not going to vote for either of the two candidates,\" said Nicolas Troitino, 31, in Buenos Aires.\n\"For me, neither of them represents the hopes that I have for the future of the country. They spend more time fighting among themselves than solving people's problems.\"\nMilei, a libertarian economist who only got into politics two years ago, has energized a hardcore of support, especially among the young, while also luring some middle-ground voters looking to punish the Peronists for the economic crisis.\n\"I'm going to vote for Milei, it wasn't my first choice, but it's what I have left,\" said 21-year-old student Valentina, who declined to give her last name.\n\"I don't agree with all of his social policies, but I do agree with most of his economic plans. It seems to me that Massa is not proposing a plan, he is not saying what he is going to do.\"\nMassa, brought in as a \"super minister\" last year to try to right the economy, has struggled so far to get it under control, with inflation speeding up to its highest level in 30 years. Net foreign currency reserves are deep in the red.\nHowever, he does have solid political experience - unlike Milei - and is seen as someone able to negotiate across the political divide, as well as with the country's powerful unions, companies and investors.\n\"It seems to me that looking forward he is the only political actor who really has the support of the entire arena of politicians, whether from the opposition or the ruling party,\" said 31-year-old judicial worker Gonzalo, giving only his first name.\n\"I don't know if he is the best, but in this context, in this head-to-head situation, it seems to me that he is the most viable option for the country.\"\nThe new Congress, already decided in the October first-round vote, will be highly fragmented, with no single bloc having a majority, meaning whoever wins will need to get backing from other factions to push through legislation.\nThis would likely put a brake on more radical reforms and force Massa or Milei to moderate. The powerful regional governors are also split between the Peronists and the main conservative coalition, with none allied to Milei.\nThe divided electorate also increases the chance of social unrest, said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center's Latin America Program, adding Argentina could be in for a \"wild ride\" if the new president fails to improve things fast.\n\"For now, Argentines are keeping their powder dry, clinging to a faint hope that the next government will find a solution to the country's profound troubles,\" he said. \"That patience will not last long, no matter who wins on Sunday.\" (Reporting by Adam Jourdan and Horacio Soria, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)",

They hit a two-year low this month.\nNevertheless, SQM executives said they expect EV demand to remain resilient in the long-term.\nSQM's senior commercial vice-president for lithium Felipe Smith attributed lower prices to softer EV demand outside China coupled with high component supplies causing excess inventories to accumulate across the whole battery supply chain.\nSmith said SQM could contract its sales volumes in line with market indices, adding the firm had also entered into several new long-term index-linked supply deals.\nChile is looking to boost state control over its lithium industry with state miner Codelco leading talks with private miners such as SQM.\nThe talks cover areas such as how lithium production will be run on the Atacama salt flats, taking into account relations with local communities and environmental sustainability.\n\"We both agreed that having a sustainable operation in the long-term is the most important target,\" SQM Chief Executive Ricardo Ramos said of the talks with Codelco over the Atacama development, adding that he did not expect significant production growth there.\n($1 = 882.4700 Chilean pesos)\n(Reporting by Sarah Morland; Editing by Valentine Hilaire and Jane Merriman, Kirsten Donovan)",

We do get back to target but it takes some time,\" he added. If governments spend less, \"it would be easier to reduce inflation,\" Macklem said.\nThe federal government's Fall Economic Statement (FES) could come as early as next week. The FES updates fiscal and economic forecasts, but it also often includes new spending plans.\nIt looks like there could be more federal spending on the way because Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has said she will unveil measures in the FES to help Canadians tackle housing and affordability.\nAs Canada grapples with a possible recession and its highest debt costs in more than two decades, economists say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should curb spending to ensure future policy choices are not forced on him.\nBoC Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers told the Senate committee about 40% of households had already renewed mortgages at a higher rate after the bank hiked rates to a 22-year high of 5.0% between March of last year and July 2023.\n\"Certainly there's pressure (on households), and we wouldn't want to minimize it, but we're not seeing anything in the data that would suggest that households are under a significant increased amount of stress\" from mortgages, Rogers said.\n(Reporting by Ismail Shakil and Steve Scherer in Ottawa; Editing by David Gregorio)",

The network will continue to broadcast the championship game as part of the new agreement.\n\u201cWe're going to make sure, along with these other partners, that this league keeps getting more and more exposure, more and more promotion, more and more branding and that we grow this sport and this league,\u201d Sean McManus, chairman of CBS Sports, said during a news conference announcing the deal in San Diego.\nStarting next season, a Friday night game on Prime Video will kick off each weekend. Each Saturday night will include a double-header on Scripps' over-the-air ION network.\nA package of at least 21 regular-season games will stream live on Paramount+, CBS Sports Network or CBS.\nAnother package of 20 games with air across ESPN's platforms, including ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes.\nThe remaining regular season games will be part of a domestic direct-to-consumer package produced and distributed by the NWSL, the league said. That could include deals for stations in the league's local markets to air games.\nIn the playoffs, Prime Video and a CBS platform will each broadcast a quarterfinal each, while ESPN/ABC airs the other two. ESPN/ABC and a CBS platform will each have a semifinal game.\nBerman said the NWSL didn't want to be behind a league-specific paywall to allow fans more ways to discover and watch the games.\n\u201cI think we're taking advantage in a very positive way of all the different ways to reach consumers,\" she said.\nThe NWSL has been working with Endeavor, a global sports and entertainment marketing firm, which has partnerships with the NHL and the NFL. Endeavor is also the league's data and international streaming provider.\nThe NWSL is in its 11th season. Next year the league will expand to 14 teams with the addition of the Utah Royals and Bay FC.\nEarlier this year, Berman reported that viewership on CBS and its streaming affiliate Paramount+ was up 21 percent year-over-year to last season.\nMegan Rapinoe's farewell match for OL Reign in Seattle averaged 683,000 viewers on CBS last month, becoming the most watched regular-season NWSL game ever. The match also drew a record 34,134 fans to Lumen Field.\nRapinoe will retire from soccer following Saturday's championship, as will Gotham defender Ali Krieger. Both have won a pair of Women's World Cups with the U.S. national team, but never an NWSL title.\n___\nAP soccer: apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "text": "\nTORONTO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Below are some key quotes from a news conference by the Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem and Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers on Wednesday after the central bank held key interest rate at 5%.\nMACKLEM ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING\n\"For next year, we expect (provincial and federal) government spending to grow at about 2.5%. If all those spending plans are realized, government spending will be adding to demand more than supply is growing and in an environment where we're trying to moderate spending and get inflation down, that's not helpful.\"\nROGERS ON HOUSING SUPPLY\n\"Until we address that (housing) supply issue, interest rates on their own are not going to help us get back to a housing affordability situation or solution. So we're really pleased to see the degree of focus that governments are putting on this issue right now.\"\nMACKLEM ON NEGATIVE GROWTH\n\"We're expecting growth below 1% for the next three, four quarters ... If you're predicting low positive growth, you can't rule out that - we're talking about small positive numbers - you can't rule out we're going to get some small negative numbers. So there could certainly be two or three small negative quarters.\"\nMACKLEM ON RECESSION, SOFT LANDING\n\"When people say the word recession, I think what they have in mind is a steep contraction in output and a large rise in unemployment. That's not what we're forecasting.\"\n\"The path to a soft landing is narrow, and in this projection, that path has gotten narrower.\"\nROGERS ON HIGHER BOND YIELDS\n\"We've seen bond yields particularly at the long end increase pretty sharply recently.\"\n\"There's a number of factors that are contributing to that. Certainly I think the markets are adjusting to the fact that inflation is looking sticky in the prospect that rates are going to need to be higher for longer, is coming into how they're pricing yields at the long end.\"\n\"There's also some structural elements, the U.S. deficit means there's a lot more bonds being issued in the US market, increased supply has to be absorbed, which is going to push prices up a bit.\"\n\"There's term premium the markets are demanding, higher rates for longer, term assets and also for the volatility. So market conditions are an important input but they're not a determinant to our price decisions. They've definitely come in they're one of the inputs we use, but they're one of many.\"\nMACKLEM ON MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT, ENERGY PRICES\n\"I'm no military expert, but it's clear there are risks that tension in the Middle East could escalate and you could see an even bigger increase in prices.\"\n\"Inflation has been above the target for two years, inflation expectations, near term inflation expectations are still above the target ... against that environment, we would need to be more cautious than normal about seeing through it (in higher energy prices) and what we'd be particularly focused on is the impacts on core inflation.\"\n\"If we saw evidence that higher energy prices were passing through to broader prices because of higher transportation costs, for example, that would be a signal that increase in oil prices is starting to feed through to the rest of the economy and that would really be something of concern to us.\"\nMACKLEM ON MOVEMENT IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR\n\"What is a bit unusual through this tightening cycle that we've been through is that normally when we raise interest rates a lot that causes the exchange rate to appreciate. That helps slow foreign demand for Canadian products. And it also has a direct effect - it reduces inflation in import prices. So because we've been moving rates up in a roughly similar fashion to other central banks, particularly the Fed, what you've seen is that the Canadian dollar has been reasonably stable - down a little bit against the U.S. dollar, up against most other currencies.\"\nMACKLEM ON IMPORT INFLATION\n\"Because the U.S. is raising rates a lot, that is restraining demand for Canadian exports. So we are getting that part of the effect. What we're not getting is, we're not getting the direct affect of an appreciation (of the Canadian dollar) to lower import inflation.\"\nMACKLEM ON RELYING ON INTEREST RATE HIKES RATHER THAN CURRENCY APPRECIATION TO TACKLE INFLATION\n\"So that does mean, everything else equal, we've got to rely more on interest rates (than appreciation of the Canadian dollar). So that is something we've had to take into account.\"\n(Reporting by Fergal Smith, Ismail Shakil, Nivedita Balu Compiled by Denny Thomas)",

Disney has run Hulu since 2019, when Comcast ceded its authority to Disney and effectively became a silent partner.\nDisney offered no comment beyond saying the acquisition will \u201cfurther Disney\u2019s streaming objectives.\u201d The deal price could end up higher once the two companies complete an agreed-upon appraisal of Hulu's fair market value, a process that may not be completed until next year.\nHulu began in 2007 and quickly evolved into as a service backed by entertainment conglomerates who hoped to stave off the internet with an online platform for their own TV shows. Disney joined in 2009, planning to offer shows from ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel. A decade later, Disney gained majority control of the business when it acquired 21st Century Fox.\nDisney has treated Hulu as one of its own services for years \u2014 for instance, when it launched its own streaming service, Disney+, in 2019 and immediately offered a streaming bundle that included Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+.\nMore recently, amid increasing pressure on streaming services brought on by untrammeled expansion, low prices and widespread password sharing, Disney has promised its own crackdown on non-paying users and raised prices for ad-free versions of Disney+ and Hulu by 20% to 27%. CEO Bob Iger said in August that the increases were designed to steer consumers toward cheaper ad-supported versions of those channels, whose subscription prices did not change.\nThe advertising market for streaming is \u201cpicking up,\u201d Iger said at the time, noting that it\u2019s healthier than traditional TV ads. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously trying with our pricing strategy to migrate more subs to the advertising supported tier.\u201d",

Euclid's first images were due to be released later on Tuesday.\nIn 2024, the private U.S. company will also launch Europe's scientific Hera probe, a follow-up mission to NASA's DART spacecraft, which last year succeeded in altering the path of a moonlet satellite in the first test of a future planetary defence system.

But given corporate profits are renewing historical highs, it's hard to say firms are more actively spending the money on plant and equipment,\" said Taro Saito, an economist at NLI Research Institute.\nCompanies increased capital expenditure by 3.4% in the third quarter from the same period the previous year, government data showed, smaller than a 4.5% increase in April-June.\nThe slowdown came even as their recurring profits rose 20.1% in the third quarter from year-before levels with a 40% jump in non-manufacturers' profits offsetting a 0.9% slide for that of manufacturers, the data showed.\nThe capital expenditure figure will be used to calculate revised third-quarter GDP data due out on Dec. 8.\nIn the preliminary GDP data, capital expenditure fell 0.6% which, coupled with a flat reading in consumption, led to an annualised 2.1% contraction in the July-September period.\nSaito of NLI Research expect revised data to show the economy shrank an annualised 2.2% in the third quarter with capital expenditure seen revised down to a 0.8% fall.\nSMBC Nikko Securities expects a slight upward revision in GDP growth to an annualised 2.0% contraction.\n\"There's no change to our view the economy shrank in July-September due to weak domestic demand, with consumption and capital expenditure remaining sluggish for two straight quarters,\" SMBC Nikko analysts wrote in a research note.\nThe outlook for corporate profits is key to how soon the Bank of Japan may phase out its massive stimulus, as the bank's scenario is based on the view that companies will keep earning enough to hike wages and boost spending on plant and equipment.\nBOJ board member\nToyoaki Nakamura\nsaid on Thursday he was keeping a close eye out on the quarterly business expenditure survey and other clues on whether corporate profitability was heightening.

A little bit of profit-taking and rebalancing have probably played in the month-end, obscuring the messaging we typically get from the price action,\" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at the National Australia Bank.\nThe MSCI index posted its strongest monthly gain since November 2020 last month, while gold topped $2,000 an ounce for the first time since May and bitcoin is now nudging at 18-month highs.\nAdding to a sense of relief that inflation is finally subsiding, oil prices fell over 2% overnight, after coordinated output cuts by the world's largest exporters fell short of market expectations.\nCrude oil prices showed no reaction to Israel's military saying it has resumed combat against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, after a seven-day truce, raising the prospect of renewed violence in the Middle East.\nBrent crude futures slipped 0.2% at $80.72 a barrel while U.S. futures were little changed at $75.88 a barrel.\nEconomic data from Asia played into the theme of slowing growth, as regional surveys of factory activity showed weakness in Japan and South Korea and mixed figures from China.\nS&P 500 futures eased 0.1% and Nasdaq futures fell 0.2%.\nCOOL IT\nData on Thursday showed both U.S. and European inflation is cooling. Benign figures on U.S. inflation reinforced market expectations for about 115 basis points in rate cuts from the Federal Reserve next year, with a first move fully priced in for May.\nEuro zone inflation came in far below expectations, triggering a slide in the euro and prompting markets to price in rate cuts of nearly 120 basis points next year from the European Central Bank, possibly as early as April.\nGoldman Sachs now expects the ECB to deliver its first interest rate cut in the second quarter of 2024, compared to an earlier forecast of a cut in the third quarter.\nJerome Powell takes part in a discussion later in the day and traders will be eager to get a sense of how the Fed Chair sees the recent shift in rate expectations towards a series of sustained cuts.\n\"I think he's going to be cautious about ramping those expectations up further, particularly as inflation is still on track, it's cooling, but it's still above their target. It would be unlikely that we hear a dovish tone from Powell,\" City Index strategist Fiona Cincotta said.\nFed Governor Christopher Waller, widely seen as a more hawkish policymaker, this week hinted at lower interest rates in the months ahead if inflation continued to ease.\nThe dollar index fell 0.2%, unwinding some of the previous day's 0.6% gain. The dollar fell 3% in November, its biggest monthly drop in a year.\nThe euro recovered some ground and rose 0.1% to $1.0902, while the pound rose 0.3% at $1.2662, supported by expectations that the Bank of England will take longer than either the Fed or the ECB in cutting rates.\nU.S. Treasuries gained in price, their strongest monthly performance since 2011. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes dropped 4 bps to 4.315%, while two-year yields fell 5 bps to 4.668%.\nGold was up 0.4% at $2,045 an ounce. The price has vaulted above $2,000 as investors have ditched their holdings of dollars and U.S. bond yields have fallen - two factors that make it more attractive to own gold.\n(Reporting by Stella Qiu; Editing by Jamie Freed, Miral Fahmy, William Maclean)",

JPMorgan predicts, in its base case, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index could end 2024 almost 9% higher than current levels, though a more pessimistic scenario calls for an 11% decline.\nThe guarded optimism of JPMorgan underscores two dilemmas emerging-market investors have faced in 2023. First, stocks have see-sawed throughout the year, preventing investors from turning strategically bullish on the asset class. JPMorgan sees no change in that trend. Secondly, a disparity within the developing world is widening, with a few countries cornering the bulk of the gains in growth, earnings and capital flows. That may continue too.\n\u201cEM equities behave as an asset class requiring market timing skills for in and out \u2013 more tactical than strategic allocation and next year looks to be no different,\u201d strategists including Pedro Martins Junior write in a note dated Nov. 29. Next year \u201cmight start bumpy for EM equities largely driven by a challenging global macro picture.\u201d\nJPMorgan\u2019s view might bring a reality check for investors who have been emboldened by bets for a dovish Federal Reserve next year and sent emerging-market stocks to the best monthly gain since January. Stocks have added $1.86 trillion since late October when easing concerns about US inflation fueled bets that the global monetary-tightening spree is over.\nRead more: Emerging Markets Poised to End November With Best Gain This Year\nHowever, index-level figures mask wide variations in the performances of national benchmarks. While countries such as Argentina and Poland have rallied from market-friendly election outcomes, markets including Pakistan and Egypt have gained on the back of dollar inflows. Meanwhile, the biggest emerging market \u2014 China \u2014 has missed the rally. Mainland stocks are capping a fourth month of losses, while enterprise shares listed in Hong Kong are little changed in November.\nRead more: China Misses Out on Everything Rally With Economy in Doldrums\nJPMorgan says 2024 could see markets with strong growth, robust earnings outlooks or close ties with the US economy outperform.\nIndia should benefit from strong domestic participation and attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to developed markets, while Saudi Arabia may see positive earnings revisions from higher oil prices. Meanwhile, Mexico is likely to cash in on the near-shoring trend, with US manufacturers moving manufacturing closer to home.\nChina won\u2019t be a washout though, according to the bank. JPMorgan sees a \u201ctactical\u201d opportunity to be bullish there, and is also overweight in countries that are indirectly exposed to its economic recovery \u2014 such as Brazil, Thailand and Indonesia.\nStill, JPMorgan said its asset allocation view stops short of being positive on risky assets because of high interest rates and geopolitical developments.\n\u201cAt this level of monetary restriction, a deeper-than-expected global economic deceleration could materialize and support a risk-off market \u2014 not ruling out a financial accident,\u201d the strategists wrote. \u201cSuch a scenario invites investors to explore downside risk for EM equities.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

For the Bank of Japan, a contraction may heighten concern that growth in the economy still isn\u2019t stable enough to withstand the ending of negative interest rates in the coming months, even if pivoting on policy might help curb inflation.\nThe expected contraction is likely to be driven largely by a rebound in imports after a sharp drop in the previous quarter, rather than a marked improvement in domestic consumption and business spending. The country\u2019s imports fell by 4.4% in the three months through June.\n\u201cSupply chain strains, such as for automobiles, have eased enabling companies to return to normal production,\u201d said Shumpei Goto, researcher at The Japan Research Institute Limited.\nThe drag of net trade will likely account for most of the fall in GDP with the balance of other factors in the economy largely showing a stagnant performance. Consumer spending is expected to inch up 0.3% on a non-annualized basis after falling the previous quarter, while capital outlays are seen rising by 0.1%, compared with a 1% fall in the second quarter.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\u201cWe see GDP contracting an annualized 0.9% from 2Q...We expect GDP to shrink again in 4Q, when slowing demand from China and the US will probably hit exports\u201d\n\u2014 Taro Kimura, economist\nFor the full report, click here\nWhile hot weather helped boost consumer spending during the first summer without pandemic restrictions, the gains don\u2019t seem strong enough to outweigh the losses recorded during the previous quarter. Sticky inflation and stagnant payrolls have likely eroded consumers\u2019 spending appetite, according to some economists.\nKishida has already opted for more spending to try and support consumers and firms amid a continuing drop in his approval ratings.\nThe cabinet green-lighted a 13.2 trillion yen ($87 billion) extra budget last week to fund Kishida\u2019s economic package worth over 17 trillion yen. The measures center on income tax cuts and handouts to low-income households aimed at helping consumers cope with the cost-of-living crunch triggered by inflation that is outstripping wage increases.\nWith persistent inflation and some signs of continued wage growth, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda recently hinted that Japan is making progress toward its 2% stable inflation target. Those comments have fueled speculation of a possible early move to adjust policy by the BOJ. But a weak GDP result could also provide a reason for the BOJ to stand pat until clearer signs that a virtuous cycle of wages, prices and growth is strengthening.\nThe yen\u2019s recent weakness is another factor fueling inflation by pushing up the prices of imports. The currency weakened to around 145 against the dollar in the summer quarter from around 138 in the previous three months.\n\u201cA weaker yen worsens the terms of trade, causing money to flow out of the country, making it difficult for companies to raise wages and crimping consumption,\u201d said Goto. \u201cIf the yen continues to weaken, it will be difficult to create a virtuous cycle.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

That compared with just 2% in 2018.\nOnly 60% of its shipments came from China during the same period, down from 80% in 2018, the same data shows. To be sure, China is still Walmart's biggest country for importing goods.\nThe shift illustrates how the rising cost of importing from China and escalating political tensions between Washington and Beijing are encouraging large U.S. companies to import more from countries including India, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\"We want the best prices,\" Andrea Albright, Walmart's executive vice president of sourcing said in an interview. \"That means I need resiliency in our supply chains. I can't be reliant on any one supplier or geography for my product because we're constantly managing things from hurricanes and earthquakes to shortages in raw materials.\"\nIn a statement, Walmart said the bill of lading data painted a partial picture of what it sourced and that creating redundancy \"does not necessarily mean\" it was reducing reliance on any of its sourcing markets. \"We're a growth business and are working to source more manufacturing capacity,\" Walmart said.\nIndia has emerged as a key component of Walmart's efforts to build that manufacturing capacity, Albright said.\nWalmart has been accelerating growth in India since 2018, when it bought a 77% stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart. Two years later, it committed to import $10 billion of goods from India each year by 2027. That is a target it remains on track to hit, Albright said. It is currently importing around $3 billion worth of goods from India each year.\nWORKFORCE, TECHNOLOGY ARE KEY DRAWS\nWalmart is importing goods ranging from toys and electronics to bicycles and pharmaceuticals from India to the U.S., Albright said. Packaged food, dry grains and pasta are also popular imports from India, she added.\nIndia, whose stock market has risen to record highs this year, is viewed as the country best equipped to outperform China in low-cost, large-scale manufacturing.\nIts rapidly growing workforce and technological advancement were a draw for Walmart, Albright said. China on the other hand reported its first decline in population in six decades last year.\nWalmart started its sourcing operations in Bangalore in 2002. Now, the company employs more than 100,000 people, including temporary workers, in the country spread across several offices under its Walmart Global Tech India unit, Flipkart Group, PhonePe and sourcing operations.\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May this year, a meeting that Modi termed \"a fruitful one.\"\n\"Happy to see India emerge as an attractive destination for investment,\" Modi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on May 14. McMillon said Walmart would \"continue to support the country's manufacturing growth and create opportunity.\"\nWalmart rival Amazon said this month it is targeting merchandise exports worth $20 billion from India by 2025.\nFreewill Sports, a small Indian supplier of soccer balls, is one company that has benefited, its Chief Executive Rajesh Kharabanda said in an interview.\nThe rising cost of shipping goods from China has also contributed to the switch to India, supply chain experts say.\n\"Sourcing from mainland China has become less competitive because of rising labor costs versus other manufacturing centers,\" said Chris Rogers, research analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence's supply chain analysis group Panjiva.\nChina's minimum wage changes from province to province and sometimes even from city to city, with a range between 1,420 yuan per month and 2,690 yuan per month ($198.52 - $376.08). Meanwhile, average wages for unskilled and semi-skilled workers in India range from about 9,000 Indian rupees to 15,000 Indian rupees a month ($108.04 - $180.06), according to central bank estimates.\nSUPPLY CHAIN SNAGS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in global supply chains, showing U.S. importers to be over-reliant on a small number of markets.\n\"Planning for a geopolitical event is like planning for a hurricane,\" said Albright. \"What I can control is where my product is coming from and how do I make sure that Christmas still happens if something happens in our supply chain.\"\nPakistan and Bangladesh have also benefited from Walmart's strategy, expanding as suppliers of home and apparel products, Albright said.\nLast year, at least eight Freewill shipments sailed to Walmart warehouses from Mundra Port in Gujarat, the largest private port in India, according to U.S. import data.\n\"There is a newfound confidence in the Indian manufacturing industry and also the availability of factory infrastructure,\" Freewill's Chief Executive Rajesh Kharabanda said in an interview.\nIndia's central bank forecasts that the country's economy will expand 6.5% this fiscal year. China is expected to grow around 5% this year.\n\"In the last 12 to 18 months there has certainly been a bigger impact,\" said Shekhar Gupta, whose family business Devgiri has been selling floor rugs to Walmart for about a decade. \"That's when Walmart started putting a true strategy behind how they wanted India at the center of their growth.\" ($1 = 7.1528 Chinese yuan renminbi) ($1 = 83.3050 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Richa Naidu and Siddharth Cavale; additional reporting by Casey Hall and Manoj Kumar.

But it is also a case of comparative advantage. Asia is weighed down by a sluggish Chinese economy, while EMEA stocks are being buffeted by two wars, lingering debt distress and vulnerable currencies. Latin America, meanwhile, benefits from its distance from geopolitical tensions, proximity to the world\u2019s largest economy and a greater ability to provide economic stimulus.\n\u201cLatin America currently appears to have an edge over EMEA as we look ahead to 2024, primarily due to its favorable macroeconomic environment and positive market reactions to anticipated policy changes,\u201d said Nenad Dinic, an equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer & Co. in Zurich. \u201cThe EMEA equity market remains more vulnerable to geopolitical risks, given the potential for a region-wide escalation in the Israel-Hamas war.\u201d\nThe MSCI EM Latin America Index, which assigns a combined 90% weight to Brazil and Mexico, is up 16% this year, the biggest advance since 2017. The largest contributions to this rally have come from Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB and Itau Unibanco Holding SA. Earnings estimates for the index\u2019s members are at a one-year high and valuations are half of what they were three years ago.\n\u201cBrazil has embarked on an aggressive rate cutting cycle, while the improved fiscal outlook has bolstered investor confidence,\u201d Dinic said. \u201cMeanwhile, Mexico\u2019s economy has benefited from the nearshoring narrative,\u201d in which US companies bring production facilities closer to their home market.\nThe index for EMEA stocks is down 0.5% in 2023, with South African mining stocks and Middle Eastern banks acting as the biggest drags. Johannesburg stocks are hobbled by waning demand from the nation\u2019s key export market \u2014 China \u2014 as well as domestic problems such as lingering power cuts and high unemployment.\nMany of the region\u2019s currencies are also pegged to the US dollar, thus leaving them unable to rally when the greenback weakens. This reduces their carry appeal at a time when juicy yields in countries like Brazil beckon traders.\n\u201cLatam markets are more sensitive to US yields versus Middle East markets where many countries have their currencies pegged to the dollar and thus carry trades aren\u2019t a driver of currencies or equities,\u201d said Ashish Chugh, a money manager at Loomis Sayles & Co.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

The plans would ratchet up federal oversight, and seek to direct banks toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window in times of extreme stress.\nBanks borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from the government-chartered FHLBs each year to fulfill short-term funding needs. The practice came under scrutiny after the FHLBs, which have implied backing from the government, lent heavily to Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank as they careened toward failure.\nAmong the major changes, the FHFA, which oversees FHLBs, will propose a rule to force many banks to hold 10% of their assets in mortgage loans to maintain access to the system. The regulator is also exploring new guardrails for lending money to troubled institutions and tougher stress tests.\n\u201cThe overwhelming sentiment from FHFA\u2019s review was that stakeholders want more, not less, from the FHLBank System,\u201d said Ryan Donovan, who heads the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, a trade group. \u201cWe will continue to work with our members, primary regulators, and other stakeholders to ensure that any changes in policy will not negatively impact our clear mission of providing essential liquidity and critical affordable housing and community development funding where it is needed.\u201d\nHowever, a big structural overhaul may also be in the offing: The FHFA is looking at consolidating some of the 11 FHLBs scattered across the country, according to the report. The regulator didn\u2019t say which of the institutions could be targeted. Sandra Thompson, who runs the agency, could slash the number to eight without any involvement from Congress.\nElevated Compensation\n\u201cThe FHLBs have always had as a part of their mission providing general liquidity, and that\u2019s not going to change,\u201d Joshua Stallings, the FHFA deputy director who oversees the FHLB system, said in an interview. \u201cBut the fact of the matter is that we have to ensure the Federal Home Loan Banks are operating in a safe and sound manner. They have to do a better job.\u201d\nSome changes would require congressional action. Officials will ask lawmakers to help curtail pay for some FHLB executives and to at least double the amount of profit that the FHLB system must spend on affordable housing.\nThe report criticized the FHLBs\u2019 practice of setting salaries by comparing them with similar positions at similarly sized commercial banks. Unlike those lenders, \u201cthe FHLBanks have lower risk profiles than commercial banks\u201d and aren\u2019t comparable in many regards, the authors wrote.\nThe FHLBs were set up in the Great Depression to boost mortgage lending, but have since morphed into a backstop for banks and credit unions. At the same time, their importance in housing finance has declined as nonbank mortgage firms grew to dominate home lending.\nFHFA Review\nSenator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat who had asked for the review of the system, said in a statement that she was \u201cglad the administration is prioritizing my recommendations to reform the Federal Home Loan Bank system to ensure they\u2019re helping us lower housing costs for Nevadans and for families across the country.\u201d Her office is working on a bill that would implement some of FHFA\u2019s plans.\nThe chief executives of FHLBs typically earn well over $1 million annually, and average pay per employee can rival that of Wall Street banks. Last year, the average compensation and benefit expense per employee at the FHLB in San Francisco was in line with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. at more than $310,000 per year, according to regulatory filings.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a culture shift that\u2019s going to be needed in the banks,\u201d said Stallings, the FHFA official. \u201cThat\u2019s going to need to change from being passive liquidity providers to being active supporters of housing and community development.\u201d\nAlthough the FHFA began its review of the system more than a year ago, the effort became part of the regulatory response to the regional banking turmoil.\nThe FHFA found that in March some large, troubled institutions had become so reliant on borrowing from the FHLBs that they hadn\u2019t set up the ability to borrow from the Fed\u2019s discount window. In one week in March, the FHLBs funded $676 billion in loans, a record, the report found.\nGoing forward, \u201cthere are going to be times when a Federal Home Loan Bank will need to work with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank to ensure borrowing can be moved over,\u201d Stallings said.\n--With assistance from Heather Perlberg and Stephanie Stoughton.\n(Updates with FHLB trade group reaction in fifth paragraph and senator\u2019s comment in 11th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nMarvel\u2019s Latest Movie Will Show If Superheroes Ever Get Tired\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

On a visit to Kyiv on Saturday, she praised Ukraine for making headway.\nThe report and recommendation will inform a key decision in December by a summit of the EU's national leaders on whether to start formal membership negotiations with Kyiv.\nSuch talks take years before candidates meet extensive legal and economic criteria to join, and the bloc is not willing to take in a country at war.\nStill, advancing Western integration is a top priority for Ukraine, where troops face battle fatigue and concerns swirl over the future of vital U.S. military aid.\nThe Commission said last June that Ukraine met two out of seven conditions the EU had set to start membership talks.\n\"You have made excellent progress,\" von der Leyen told a news conference with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday.\n\"You are fighting an existential war and at the same time deeply reforming your country,\" she said in highlighting reforms to Ukraine's justice system, reining in oligarchs and tackling money laundering.\nShe expressed confidence that Ukraine would soon complete the remaining steps - related to fighting corruption and safeguarding minority rights - and advance on its EU path.\nZelenskiy said Kyiv would deliver on the conditions, and that a positive EU decision would give fresh motivation to his society and troops. He said Ukraine eventually joining the EU would strengthen both.\n\"There will be no grey geo-political zones in Europe. We will secure a new basis for growth and development of Ukraine and all European countries. We will guarantee to our country and citizens real economic and social security,\" he said.\nHis comments capped a week when Ukraine's commander-in-chief said the war was moving towards attritional fighting and the Italian premier spoke of international fatigue with the war during a prank call that was later made public.\nMOLDOVA, GEORGIA\nIn good news for Ukraine, Germany's foreign minister expressed confidence that the EU would advance its bid to join.\nKyiv is expected to get a green light this week \"on the understanding that\" it does more to tackle graft and secure minority rights, the latter issue raised by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who prides himself on his contacts with Moscow.\nThe Commission report on Wednesday will also cover other EU hopefuls, including Georgia and Moldova.\nThe latter got nine conditions to start membership talks, including fighting organised crime, and can get a conditional positive recommendation along with its neighbour Ukraine.\n\"Moldova has shown its resilience and commitment to progress its EU agenda while taking measures to mitigate the impact of Russia's war of aggression,\" said a draft of the report, which was seen by Reuters ahead of official publication.\nEU officials say Georgia has not satisfied the 12 conditions it was given to win candidate country status, something Kyiv and Chisinau secured last year a few months after Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February.\nBut Tbilisi has the backing of Orban and could still move ahead on its EU path as the bloc wrestles for influence with Russia.

After the central bank kept rates unchanged, some companies decided to sell equity shares, he said.\nThe Fed earlier this month kept its overnight short-term interest rate target unchanged at between 5.25% and 5.5% and preserved the option to raise rates again as inflation is still well above its 2% target.\nFor initial public offerings, it will take a while for activity to pick up, with a potential recovery next year.\nThe trading environment for stocks and fixed income is far more interesting given the interest rate environment, inflation and escalating geopolitical tensions that are fueling volatility in markets.\n\"We're sitting on what is one of the more interesting trading environments in my career,\" he said.\nEsposito addressed Goldman's move to scale back its consumer ambitions.\nGrowing investor skepticism over the business -- and $3 billion of losses -- prompted CEO David Solomon to shift Goldman's focus back to its traditional strengths of investment banking and trading.\nThe decision to move into consumer banking was made when the world was facing zero interest rates and no bank was earning its cost of capital, Esposito said.\n\"We realized that's a hard business that we don't necessarily have any differentiated or competitive advantage to be in,\" he said.\n\"And so then there was a healthy debate about the sizing and scaling of our consumer ambition. And I think the firm under David's leadership did something very, very brave.\"\nTo view the live broadcast of the World Stage go to the Reuters NEXT news page: https://www.reuters.com/world/reuters-next/\n(Reporting by Lananh Nguyen and Anirban Sen in New York and Saeed Azhar Editing by Chris Reese and Diane Craft)",

And while Wall Street is still overwhelmingly positive on the stock, analysts only see 36% upside over the next 12 months \u2014 a nice return, but significantly less than in 2023.\nThe stock\u2019s sluggishness in the second half is a reflection of the extremely bullish expectations that were priced in during the initial craze for AI-related stocks. But now, some are cautioning that Nvidia\u2019s current growth trajectory isn\u2019t sustainable over the long term, especially in an industry notorious for its boom-to-bust cycles.\n\u201cWith exceptionally strong demand, significant market share, and no real alternatives for its products, we believe the company is experiencing peak demand,\u201d wrote Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk, who downgraded Nvidia to the equivalent of neutral last week. \u201cThis will make it more challenging for the company to continually outpace expectations and drive the stock meaningfully higher.\u201d\nShares rose 0.9% on Wednesday.\nPart of the issue is that expectations are so high. For the year ending in early 2025, Wall Street now estimates adjusted earnings per share of about $20, more than double what analysts were forecasting just six months ago.\nThose rising estimates have brought Nvidia\u2019s valuation down from the nosebleed 50 times earnings ratio that the stock traded at in the summer. That\u2019s good news for anyone holding the stock, and perhaps an entry point for anyone who missed the torrid rally.\nBut it may be hard to find anyone who doesn\u2019t already own Nvidia \u2014 presenting another hurdle for further share-price gains. An analysis by Morgan Stanley of the top 100 actively managed institutional portfolios in the third quarter showed the average portfolio concentration of Nvidia was about 2.3%, well above its historical average of 0.7%.\n\u201cEveryone loves the stock, so more or less everyone already owns it or overweights it, and that means it will be tough to find the next incremental buyer,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder, which owns the stock. \u201cShares should continue to move higher over the long term, but the days of popping 20% on very strong results are over.\u201d\nTo be sure, a new catalyst could change everything. But at the moment, it\u2019s hard to see what that could be. The company is updating its H100 processor and is frequently forging or deepening partnerships with other tech companies \u2014 most recently Amazon.com Inc.\nBut neither product updates or partnerships seem likely to give the shares a big boost, and several risks are looming on the horizon. Revenue could take a hit from US curbs on exports to China, though Nvidia is reported to be making new chips for that market that won\u2019t run afoul of the restrictions. Competition is expected to ramp up from rivals including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and customers like Microsoft Corp., while there\u2019s also a risk of blowback against the proliferation of AI as it becomes more mainstream.\n\u201cWhat else can Nvidia do except announce they have a cure for cancer?\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable if those who came late are feeling frustrated that the party seems to be winding down.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nRecent gains for major internet and technology stocks has led to a decline in volatility associated with the Nasdaq 100.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Efforts to restructure the debts of the world\u2019s poorest nations are splintering, with a deal between Zambia and its creditors just the latest to hit trouble.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nCitigroup Cuts Over 300 Senior Manager Roles in Latest Restructuring\nNearly All of OpenAI Staff Threaten to Go to Microsoft If Board Doesn\u2019t Quit\nThe Doomed Mission Behind Sam Altman\u2019s Shock Ouster From OpenAI\nMicrosoft Ends Weekend of OpenAI Drama With Coup of Its Own\nTech Giants Roar as Nasdaq 100 Hits 22-Month High: Markets Wrap\nSetbacks have become commonplace in debt talks with defaulted issuers likes Zambia, Sri Lanka and Ghana, raising concern over the next batch of sovereigns whose bond prices are showing distress. The delays hit the three nations\u2019 debt on Monday and further weakened sentiment for an asset class that\u2019s already seen $31 billion in outflows from emerging-market debt funds this year.\nThe culprit is a restructuring framework put in place by the Group of 20 three years ago that aimed to help the poorest nations back on their feet during the coronavirus era. But that process has ended up making talks more vulnerable to holdouts, turning negotiations into a tug-of-war between traditional creditors, including the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club of lender nations, bilateral lenders such as China, and other bondholders.\nGeopolitical divisions and varying transparency standards, especially related to China\u2019s rapid expansion into a large lender to emerging nations, have made debt deals more difficult to reach and limited the role of private bondholders.\nWhen Zambia\u2019s government announced earlier on Monday that talks with bondholders had collapsed for the moment, it was \u201cobviously disappointing to private creditors who have been patient with a country such as Zambia for literally years,\u201d said Richard Segal, a London-based fixed-income analyst at Ambrosia Capital Ltd. \u201cThis is the first instance I am aware of where an agreement with one group of creditors has been effectively vetoed by another.\u201d\nThe development comes after Zambia, which defaulted in 2020, reached a memorandum of understanding last month with \u201cofficial creditors\u201d \u2014 meaning, essentially, other sovereign governments that had lent it money \u2014 to restructure $6.3 billion of debt.\nThe southern African nation needed to receive treatment at least as favorable from private creditors under the G20\u2019s Common Framework guidelines. So it agreed on revised terms with bondholders, but those were rejected by official creditors, the government said on Monday. Lazard Ltd., the financial adviser to Zambia, declined to comment.\nYvette Babb, a portfolio manager at William Blair B.V based in The Hague, said the Common Framework, which was designed to confront fears of a liquidity crunch in the pandemic era, has injected an additional level of complexity into such talks. In Zambia\u2019s case, disagreements among official creditors appear to be delaying the restructuring, she said.\n\u201cThe negotiations are taking such a large amount of time, and they don\u2019t only affect Zambia or Ghana but the whole asset class,\u201d Babb said. \u201cThis creates questions on the speed of restructuring of other distressed assets, and if they may be able to reach a conclusion.\u201d\nThe upshot of Zambia\u2019s woes is that they \u201cwill make eurobond sales by low-income countries close to impossible without at least partial guarantees,\u201d Ambrosia\u2019s Segal said.\n\u2018Completely\u2019 Undermined\nThe rejection of the revised Zambia deal by official creditors will \u201ccompletely undermine the already diminishing credibility of the Common Framework,\u201d the steering committee of bondholders said in reaction to the news on Monday. \u201cIt is not for official bilateral creditors to dictate debt terms to other creditors in circumstances where the government has confirmed comparability of treatment.\u201d\nIn a report from June, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co, led by Ben Ramsey, said they have long been skeptical about restructurings where the official sector takes the lead in defining and imposing the terms.\nChina generally differs from multilaterals in lending at higher interest rates but making no requirements for economic or political reforms on the emerging markets receiving the loans, JPMorgan said. Furthermore, the terms of its loans often aren\u2019t public, making the implementation of any \u201cfair treatment\u201d principle difficult to assess.\n\u201cEven if the official sector can eventually get on the same page, the private sector including bondholders may disagree with what assumptions are being made about the losses they take,\u201d Ramsey wrote.\nTalks with Sri Lanka and Ghana are also dragging on, while expectations for higher-for-longer interest rates in the US are making borrowing difficult \u2014 or impossible \u2014 for the poorest emerging-market sovereigns.\nDollar bonds of 16 developing nations currently trade at a spread of at least 1,000 basis points over similar Treasuries, a common definition for \u201cdistress,\u201d according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nZambia\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2027 fell about 2.5 cents on Monday to about 60 cents. The price of Sri Lanka\u2019s dollar-denominated notes maturing in 2030 fell to a one-month low of around 48 cents, while Ghana\u2019s 2027 dollar-debt fell below 43 cents.\nThe prolonged debt restructurings are clouding the outlook for emerging markets at a time when high global interest rates have already curbed appetite for the asset class, said Trang Nguyen, global head of emerging-market credit strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London.\n\u201cIt would be different if it was just a one-off, but actually we have multiple debt restructurings that are happening concurrently, all with varying degrees of delays, and that has been a really dampening factor for the asset class overall especially when cash gives you 5%,\u201d she said, referring to US Treasury yields.\nThat all marks a change from restructuring deals in the recent past, with Argentina and Ecuador completing negotiations with private creditors in less than a year in 2020.\n\u201cOne major inefficiency of the Common Framework is that private creditors are excluded from the negotiating table and are presented with a fait-accompli,\u201d said Simon Quijano-Evans, the chief economist at Gemcorp Capital Management Ltd in London. \u201cThe G20 need to explain how that can be good for anyone, whether debtor or creditor.\u201d\n--With assistance from Matthew Hill.\n(Updates with bond performance from the second paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\nInflation Raging in Triple Digits Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\nThe Impact and Cost of Musk\u2019s Endorsement of Antisemitism on X\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The nation\u2019s economy expanded at a robust 4.9% annual rate from July through September as Americans defied higher prices, rising interest rates and widespread forecasts of a recession to spend at a brisk pace.\nThe Commerce Department said the economy expanded last quarter at the fastest pace in nearly two years \u2014 and more than twice the 2.1% annual rate of the previous quarter.\nThursday\u2019s report on the nation\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 the economy\u2019s total output of goods and services \u2014 showed that consumers drove the acceleration, ramping up their spending on everything from cars to restaurant meals. Even though the painful inflation of the past two years has soured many people\u2019s view of the economy, millions have remained willing to splurge on vacations, concert tickets and sports events.\n\u201cThis is just a very resilient economy that continues to take hit after hit and keep on,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a tax and consulting firm.\nYet the robust growth may prove to be a high-water mark for the economy before a steady slowdown begins in the current October-December quarter and extends into 2024. The breakneck pace is expected to ease as higher long-term borrowing rates, on top of the Federal Reserve\u2019s short-term rate hikes, cool spending by businesses and consumers. Economists have projected that growth could slow to an annual pace of just 1.5% in the final three months of this year.\nOne sign of the coming slowdown, Brusuelas said, was a 3.8% drop in business spending on new machinery and other equipment last quarter. That pullback likely reflected the higher cost of borrowing to finance such purchases.\nAnd other key drivers of growth in the July-September period could prove short-lived. They include a surge in stockpiled goods that businesses added to their warehouses and store shelves. The buildup in these inventories accounted for about a quarter of last quarter's growth from July to September and isn't considered likely to be repeated.\nAn increase in house and apartment construction also boosted growth in the third quarter. But as mortgage rates near 8% and sales of existing homes continue to fall, analysts expect housing to weaken the overall economy in the coming months.\n\u201cWe can already see the drag forming in the final three months of the year,\u201d Brusuelas said.\nIn addition, consumers are spending more of their savings \u2014 a drawdown that could eventually weigh on growth. Many, particularly lower- and middle-income Americans, are stepping up their use of credit cards. These cards now carry much higher rates after the Fed boosted its benchmark interest rate to about 5.4%, its highest level in 22 years. Americans, as a whole, saved just 3.8% of their income last quarter, down from 5.2% in the April-June quarter and notably below pre-pandemic levels.\nSeveral Fed officials acknowledged in speeches last week that the most recent economic data showed growth picking up by more than they had expected. Yet most of the policymakers signaled that they will likely keep their key rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, unchanged when they meet next week.\nEven consumers who are closely watching their budgets, though, are still willing to treat themselves in many cases. Among them is Danielle Gagliano, who was at Kohl\u2019s department store in Ramsey, New Jersey, last week with her 2-year-old son, returning an item and picking up three pairs of pants for her 10-year-old daughter.\nGagliano, 35, said she has been doing more of her food shopping at ShopRite and discounter Aldi and less at Acme, which she feels is more expensive. And she\u2019s been looking for more discounts.\nStill, Gagliano said she makes room in her budget to go out to dinner with her family a couple times a month.\n\u201cI like to support the local restaurants,\u201d she said.\nA range of factors have helped fuel consumer spending, which accounts for the bulk of the economy\u2019s growth. Though many Americans are still feeling under pressure from two years of high inflation, average pay has outpaced price increases and enhanced people\u2019s ability to spend.\nAnd inflation is steadily easing, Thursday's report showed. Excluding volatile food and gas prices, core inflation slowed to a 2.4% annual rate in the third quarter, according to the Fed's preferred measure. That is down from 3.7% in the second quarter to the slowest pace in nearly three years.\nSmaller price increases likely encouraged some people to spend lavishly on both goods and services last quarter. There were some one-time factors that boosted spending, like blockbuster concert tours by Taylor Swift and Beyonce. Fans spent an average of $1,500 on air fares, hotel rooms, and concert tickets to see Swift's shows, and an average of $1,800 for Beyonce, according to calculations by Sarah Wolfe, U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley.\nAmericans, as a whole, also began the year on healthy financial footing, according to a report last week from the Fed. The net worth of a typical household jumped 37% from 2019 through 2022. Home prices shot higher, and the stock market rose in the biggest surge on records dating back more than 30 years.\nEven so, consumers are likely reining in their spending in the final three months of the year, and the sluggish housing market is dragging on the economy as well. This month, nearly 30 million people began repaying several hundred dollars a month in student loans, which could slow their ability to spend. Those loan repayments had been suspended when the pandemic struck three years ago.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, in a discussion last week, said he was generally pleased with how the economy was evolving: Inflation has slowed to an annual rate of 3.7% from a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022. At the same time, steady growth and hiring have forestalled a recession, which was widely predicted at the end of last year.\nIf those trends continue, it could allow the Fed to achieve a highly sought-after \u201csoft landing,\u201d in which it would manage to slow inflation to its 2% target without causing a deep recession.\nStill, Fed officials were surprised by a strong government report last week on retail sales, which showed that spending at stores and restaurants jumped last month by much more than expected. Powell has since acknowledged that if the economy were to keep growing robustly, the Fed might have to raise rates further. Its benchmark short-term rate is now about 5.4%, a 22-year high.\n___\nAP Retail Writer Anne D'Innocenzio contributed to this report from New York.",

Strong performances from the unit in recent quarters has helped the firm mitigate a slump in dealmaking.\nSimkowitz, a three-decade veteran of the banking industry, is the head of investment management at Morgan Stanley. He is also the co-head of the firm's strategy and execution.\nGORMAN'S LEGACY\nGorman joined Morgan Stanley in February 2006 and was named co-president the following year. As the 2008 financial crisis unfolded, threatening to topple some of Wall Street's biggest firms, Gorman had a front-row seat alongside then-CEO John Mack.\n\"James Gorman is an exceptional visionary banker, having guided a traditional, white-shoe investment bank through a transformative and successful evolution into a diversified, dynamic wealth management institution,\" said Ana Arsov, managing director at Moody's.\n\"As with all his endeavors, his succession has been well-planned, facilitating a smooth transition.\"\nThe executive, a music fan also known for his dry sense of humor, grew up in Australia. He earned bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Melbourne and an M.B.A. from Columbia University. He eventually became a U.S. citizen.\nGorman was named CEO in January 2010 at the same time as his counterpart Brian Moynihan at Bank of America. Both executives, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co's Jamie Dimon, have led their respective firms through the wreckage of the financial crisis.\nEarlier this month, Morgan Stanley's third-quarter profit showed a hit from lethargic dealmaking and shares sank as investors were also disappointed by smaller inflows to the wealth management division and the lack of announcements in the CEO succession.\nShares of the Wall Street powerhouse were down marginally in extended trading on Wednesday.

The Mystic power facility is scheduled to retire after May 2024.\nThe company provides fuel to its Mystic power plant and to gas providers in New England using the LNG imported at Everett.\nHowever, the retirement plan may change if the regional grid operator or another body determines the plant is required to preserve reliability or for other reasons.\nThe regulators noted evidence indicating that Everett's retirement would be \"manageable\" for the electric system, at least in the near-term.\nBut if these expectations did \"not materialize as anticipated\", it may become difficult to maintain affordability and reliability in the event of a major winter event, they said in a joint statement.\nIn September, FERC and NERC presented findings and recommendations of their joint inquiry into the power outages and rolling blackouts during winter storm Elliott in December 2022.\nThe inquiry found that the sub-freezing temperatures and extreme cold weather caused unplanned electric generation supply losses exceeding 90,000 megawatts.\n\"Although much of the attention has focused on the electric outages, the storm's effects on the natural gas system, and the local gas distribution system in particular, cannot be overlooked,\" FERC and NERC warned.\nThe storm lowered flows of natural gas into the pipelines at a time when shippers were requesting increased volumes of natural gas, dramatically lowering line pressures and putting stress on the natural gas system.

Musk didn't hold back, stating, \"In my opinion, he fundamentally hates humanity.\" This isn't the first time Musk has taken a jab at Soros, previously likening him to the X-Men comic book supervillain Magneto.\nMusk highlighted the strategic nature of Soros\u2019 investments in various political arenas, acknowledging the significant impact these can have on policy-making. \"He's doing things that erode the fabric of civilization,\" Musk said. He criticized Soros\u2019 support for district attorney candidates who are lenient on crime, suggesting this contributes to law enforcement issues in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. \"Getting [district attorneys] elected who refused to prosecute crime, that\u2019s part of the problem in San Francisco and LA and other cities. So why would you do that?\"\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nElon Musk and Richard Branson explore early-stage startups. Don\u2019t miss out on this exciting investment opportunity just like these visionaries.\nFrom Jeff Bezos to Oprah Winfrey, the success stories began with an early investment in startups. Be part of the next big thing here.\nMusk's primary grievance seems to stem from Soros's financial support of progressive, soft-on-crime district attorneys in various cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles. Musk argued that this financial backing contributes to the issues of crime and law enforcement in these areas, saying, \"That's part of the problem in San Francisco and LA and other cities.\"\nOne of Musk's most intriguing points in the interview was his theory on why Soros prefers to focus on local races rather than national campaigns. According to Musk, Soros realized that changing how laws are enforced can be more effective than altering the laws themselves. He elaborated, \"The lowest value for money is a presidential race,\" he said. \"Then the next lowest value for money is a Senate race, then a Congress. But once you get to sort of city and state district attorneys, the value [is] extremely good.\u201d He pointed out Soros\u2019 tactical insight: \"Soros realized that you don\u2019t actually need to change the laws. You just need to change how they\u2019re enforced.\"\nTrending: Get equity and front row seats to the startups and small businesses you love \u2014\u2060 for as little as $100.\nHowever, Musk's criticism didn't stop at Soros. He also discussed his controversial decision to acquire Twitter, which he rebranded as \"X,\" for $44 billion the previous year. Musk expressed concerns about the platform's influence on society, stating that it had a \"corrosive effect.\" He argued that Twitter was \"fundamentally controlled by the far left\" and functioned as an \"information weapon\" for radical progressives, drowning out other viewpoints.\nMusk's ownership of X has been marked by significant changes, including requiring users to pay for premium features and loosening content moderation standards. These moves have drawn intense scrutiny and further fueled the ongoing debate about the influence of social media on public discourse. Elon Musk's outspoken opinions and actions, whether about individuals like Soros or tech giants like Twitter, continue to be a subject of public interest and debate, reflecting the broader discussion on the role of influential figures in shaping digital and political landscapes.\nSoros and Musk are both notable figures in the electric vehicle industry. Soros has invested in Rivian Automotive Inc., a rival to Musk\u2019s Tesla. In its first quarter on the public market, Soros immediately took a big stake, buying 19.8 million shares and making Rivian his largest holding. Even after selling more than 15 million shares since that time, Soros\u2019 remaining Rivian stake is still worth about $69.8 million as of August 2023.

Korean shares retrace rally, MSCI AxJ drops 1.2%\n*\nTreasuries steady in Asia trade\n(Updates prices, adds quotes and details throughout)\nBy Tom Westbrook\nSINGAPORE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Asian stocks snapped a three-day winning streak on Tuesday, as investor enthusiasm about a peak in global interest rates started losing steam, while the Australian dollar fell after a rate hike came with a shift in tone from the central bank.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.2%. Over the previous three sessions, a rally had lifted the benchmark by nearly 6%.\nS&P 500 futures fell 0.2%, as did FTSE futures while European futures fell 0.3%.\nTreasuries were broadly steady in Asia, having unwound a little of the rally that followed the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates on hold last week.\nTen-year yields hovered at 4.63% - about 10 basis points (bps) above where they closed on Friday, but well below the 5% mark touched in late October.\n\"It continues to be a tug-of-war between markets and the Fed, as the latter has suggested that higher long-end yields would ... do the job of policy tightening for them,\" said Nicholas Chia, macro strategist at Standard Chartered.\n\"Markets probably fret that lower yields would force the Fed to re-think about an extended pause.\"\nFed funds futures imply only a slim chance of another hike, but bets on rate cuts next year were trimmed.\nIn foreign exchange trade, the Australian dollar was the biggest mover, falling about 0.9% to $0.6430 after the Reserve Bank of Australia announced a 25 bp hike, as expected, taking the cash rate to a 12-year high of 4.35%.\nBut the central bank softened its language on the necessity of any further action.\n\"It was a dovish hike ... it's not pointing to any immediate need for a follow-up,\" said RBC Capital Markets rates strategist Rob Thompson on the phone from Sydney.\nThe New Zealand dollar was dragged along for the ride, falling 0.6% to $0.5930. Three-year Australian government bond futures rallied three ticks and the ASX200 lifted off lows to finish down 0.3%.\nDEMAND PRESSURE\nData on Tuesday showed China's imports unexpectedly grew in October, while exports contracted faster than expected, in a mixed set of indicators that showed the recovery in the world's second-largest economy remains uneven.\n\"The combined effects of both tight credit and a rotation to services consumption exerts further pressure on global demand for goods,\" said HSBC economist Erin Xin in a note.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.4%, while mainland China blue chips fell 0.5%.\nSouth Korean shares fell 3% as traders unwound some of Monday's surge on the reimposition of a short-selling ban. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.1%.\nOn Wall Street the Nasdaq had logged a seventh straight session of gains on Monday - capping its longest streak since January - though its gain was a slender 0.3% as the rally loses momentum.\nA slightly stronger dollar has pushed the Japanese yen back to the weak side of 150 to the dollar, and it hovered at 150.2 in the Asia session.\nThe euro took a breather at $1.0710 and analysts expect any prospective decline in the greenback to be bumpy and modest, even if the Fed starts cutting rates next year.\nThe U.S. dollar index was steady at 105.36.\n\"Outside of monetary policy, it is weak global growth and abundant geopolitical risks ranging from Taiwan to the Middle East and Russia that we see as providing continued safe-haven support to the dollar, slowing a dollar down cycle,\" said Deutsche Bank strategists Alan Ruskin and George Saravelos.\nIn commodity markets oil steadied with Brent crude futures at $84.75 a barrel, supported by nerves that conflict in the Middle East could expand and threaten supply and as Russia and Saudi Arabia reaffirmed production cuts.\nGold nursed modest losses at $1,972, while bitcoin hovered just shy of $35,000.\n(Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore.

Bayern Munich top the group with nine points after beating Galatasary 3-1 earlier.\nThe victory looked in doubt when Copenhagen's Jordan Larsson stepped up to the spot after Scott McTominay attempted a clearance and caught Elias Achouri in the head with a high boot in the 94th minute.

And it must cover 73 million acres (30 million hectares), as originally planned when the administration announced the sale in the spring.\nThe administration later scaled back the area covered by the lease sale to 67 million acres (27 million hectares) as part of an agreement to protect the endangered Rice\u2019s whale. But the state of Louisiana joined oil and gas companies in opposing the changes.\nA federal judge in southwest Louisiana ordered the sale to go on without the whale protections, which also included regulations involving vessel speed and personnel. That led to an appeal by environmental groups \u2014 and delays while the arguments continued.\nOn Tuesday, a 5th Circuit panel rejected the appeal.\nOil industry attorneys disputed that the protections were needed in the area to be leased and said the administration had not gone through legally required procedures to impose the new restrictions.\nIndustry supporters also had been critical of the Biden administration's handling of the sale, which was ordered in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.\nAn attorney for an environmental group called the ruling \u201cdisappointing and unjustified,\u201d in an emailed statement.\n\u201cThis could be the difference between doing the bare minimum to save this species, and allowing it to vanish,\u201d George Torgun, an attorney for the group Earthjustice, said in a statement.\nThe American Petroleum Institute, a powerful U.S. oil and gas industry trade association, lauded the development.\n\u201cEnergy independence scored an important win tonight with the Fifth Circuit decision lifting unjustified restrictions on oil and natural gas vessels and restoring acreage for offshore energy development,'' said Senior Vice President and General Counsel Ryan Meyers.\nHis statement added that drilling in the Gulf plays a critical role in maintaining \u201caffordable, reliable American energy production\" and that the judge's \"decision creates greater certainty for the essential energy workforce and the entire Gulf Coast economy.\u201d",

Therefore, the 60 billion euros transfer counted only as a deficit in 2021, but not in the years 2023 and 2024 when most of the spending was supposed to occur.\nThe ruling against this, however, indicates that Berlin will either have to stick more closely to the spirit of the debt brake, suspend it again, or reform it altogether.\nClemens Fuest of the Ifo Economic Institute said one option would be to suspend the brake for 2023 and 2024 arguing the transition to a carbon neutral economy is another emergency situation.\n\"Whether this would be compatible with the constitution however is unclear after this ruling,\" said Fuest.\nMarcel Fratzscher of the German Institute for Economic Research said government attempts in the last 12 years to circumvent the debt brake \"have contributed to ever more absurd manoeuvres\".\n\"The debt brake is no longer in tune with the times, because it takes the necessary room for manoeuvre away from politicians to fight crises and invest in the future.\"\nWHAT WILL THE IMPACT BE ON RULING COALITION?\nThe ruling is expected to heighten tensions in Scholz's already fractious three-way coalition, which has seen support slump since taking office nearly two years ago as it tackles a series of crises, in part due to public infighting.\nJust a third of voters would vote for the parties of the coalition if elections were to be held now, according to the latest survey by pollster Forsa.\nSeveral FDP lawmakers have in recent months called for the party, which has fallen out of several state parliaments in regional elections over the past year, to leave the coalition.\nMeanwhile, demands from the Greens to reform the debt brake to enable more investment after years of neglect are likely to pick up, clashing with the FDP's insistence on sticking to the rules and remaining fiscally cautious.

The deal would be Australia's second largest buyout in 2023 after Newmont Corp paid $17.8 billion for Newcrest Mining.\nThe energy company's shares closed on Wednesday at A$8.42, up 1.69%, but well below the offer price of A$9.43 per share.\nBrookfield Corp, which has teamed up with EIG Partner's MidOcean Energy, has offered Origin shareholders A$6.59 and $1.86 in cash and a A39c special dividend.\nAt the time of the new offer on Nov 2, the bid equated to A$9.53 per share, but foreign exchange volatility has pushed that down to the current level.\nThe subdued share price suggested investors did not believe the deal would go through, according to Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments and capital markets at VanEck Australia, which voted its 0.3% stake in support of the deal.\n\"I'm not confident of it going ahead. As much as we've voted for it, I don't know if the numbers stack up. If everyone thought it was going ahead the share price would be higher,\" he told Reuters.\nBrookfield and Origin Energy declined to comment on Thursday's vote.\nOrigin shares remain 2.1% lower than last week's close and have traded well below the offer price since the new bid arrived, suggesting investors were pessimistic of its success.\n\"With Australian Super interest increasing 16.5% in Origin, the probability is that the EIG/Brookfield scheme will fail,\" Macquarie analyst Ian Myles wrote in a recent note.

        "text": "\nMore than 1.3 million chickens are being slaughtered on an Ohio egg farm as the bird flu continues to take a toll on the industry.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture said all 1.35 million chickens on the farm in Ohio's Union County will be slaughtered to help limit the spread of the highly contagious virus after a case was confirmed in the flock this week.\nThe outbreak that began in early 2022 has been much less severe this year as fewer cases of the virus are being found among the wild birds that spread it. But there have still been 8.1 million birds killed this year to help control the spread of the disease and 5.8 million of those have come just this month as several large egg farms have been struck. That includes 1.2 million birds at one Iowa egg farm and another 940,000 chickens at one Minnesota egg farm that had to be killed.\nEgg farms tend to be much larger than turkey or chicken farms, sometimes with millions of birds. That's a big part of why Iowa \u2014 the nation's largest egg producing state \u2014 has been hit the hardest in this outbreak with nearly 17.3 million birds killed. Ohio is also one of the top egg producing states but it has seen only 5.1 million birds killed because of bird flu.\nThis week, there have also been sizeable bird flu cases confirmed on farms in Minnesota, Maryland, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Georgia and California. But the biggest one of those cases was the Maryland chicken farm where 198,200 birds were killed.\nIn 2022, nearly 58 million birds were slaughtered as part of the outbreak. The highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through droppings and nasal discharges.\nFarmers are working hard to keep the virus from infecting their flocks by taking steps like requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. But the virus is difficult to keep out particularly along the main pathways for migrating birds who are headed south for the winter.\nOfficials say bird flu doesn\u2019t represent a significant health threat. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation\u2019s food supply. Properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.89 degrees Celsius) will also kill any viruses.",

        "text": "\nNov 27 (Reuters) - As the year's biggest U.S. online shopping day got underway on Monday, discount-seekers used their phones and laptops to snap up electronics, clothing, toys, jewelry, appliances and even personal care products.\nHeavy online traffic and transactions could add up to a record $12 billion outlay by U.S. shoppers on Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Analytics. That would represent 5.4% more than last year, it said.\nRetailers were set to dangle average price cuts of 30% on electronics, and 19% on furniture. \"We are seeing very strong discounts,\" said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks data through Adobe's Experience Cloud service for e-commerce platforms.\n\"You have consumers out there who are very price-sensitive and conscientious, and who want to make sure they get the very best possible deal.\"\nAmazon began marketing its Cyber Monday Deals as early as Saturday, including up to 46% off some Instant Pot kitchen appliances, 37% off certain Vitamix blenders, and 35% on Amazon devices including a 55-inch Amazon Fire TV.\nWalmart, eager to capture market share, slashed prices on Sunday night, joining the trend of retailers' early discounts on major shopping days.\nMore than half of purchases online on Monday are likely to be made on mobile devices, according to Adobe, which says it has a window into transaction data at 85% of the top 100 internet retailers. This holiday season, mobile-phone transactions may for the first time overtake purchases made from desktop computers, it said.\nLast-minute shoppers on Monday could spend $4 billion between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET alone, Pandya said, \"because consumers are going to be concerned about discounts weakening after that.\"\nPandya said he would watch whether holiday season shoppers on Monday would continue \"downshifting to cheaper goods\" in categories, a pattern he noticed earlier this year.\n\"Because people are getting gifts for other people, they seem to stretch a little more, and splurge,\" he said, and retailers' steep discounts may make it possible for them to avoid \"substituting cheaper items.\"\nMany \"retailers have really pulled back on their inventory levels, to preserve capital and increase margins,\" said Rob Garf, vice president and general manager for retail at Salesforce, which tracks data flowing through its Commerce Cloud e-commerce service.\n\"The risk consumers take at this point for waiting too long is that a product may not be available when they go to buy it,\" Garf said.

Countries that have imposed such bans are Austria, France, Greece and the Czech Republic. Portugal, Poland, Romania, Belgium, Slovakia and Spain, in turn, have rules in place that likely make it impossible to export the drug.\nGermany's BfArM reiterated a call for physicians to only prescribe drugs from the class of GLP-1 receptor agonists, which include Ozempic and Eli Lilly's Trulicity, for their approved use against diabetes.\nIt has also called on pharmacies to only fill prescriptions that state diabetes as the indication and urged \"all relevant actors\" not to export the drugs.

        "text": "\nBy Katherine Masters and Arriana McLymore\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - As China-founded e-commerce behemoth Shein moves to list in New York, U.S. lawmakers are again calling on it to prove that forced labor is not used to make its $5 t-shirts and $10 sweaters.\nShein confidentially filed for an initial public offering on Monday and could launch sales of its shares some time in 2024. The Singapore-based company has not determined the size of the deal or the valuation at IPO. Bloomberg earlier this month reported that it targeted up to $90 billion in the float.\nFounded in 2012, Shein has been eyeing a U.S. IPO for at least three years but has been deterred by headwinds that included tensions between Beijing and Washington.\nThe online fast-fashion retailer, which manufactures most of its merchandise in China, faces criticism that Uyghur forced labor is used to make its low-priced apparel and home goods.\nCritics are concerned that Shein may use contract manufacturers in China's Xinjiang region, where advocates and governments have accused China of interning Uyghurs and other largely Muslim minority groups. Beijing denies any abuses.\nConvincing regulators that its supply chain is clean will likely be a major regulatory hurdle as Shein works to convince the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that its shares should be traded publicly.\n\u201cIf the fast-fashion giant Shein wants to go public in the U.S., they should have to prove to American consumers that their products are not sourced from forced labor,\u201d Democratic Representative Jennifer Wexton said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe congresswoman earlier this year led a bipartisan call for the SEC to halt Shein\u2019s IPO until it verifies that the company does not use forced labor within its supply chain.\nA separate group of Republican attorneys general from 16 U.S. states has also asked the SEC to audit the company, and Shein has been investigated by two separate congressional committees over its sourcing and use of a trade loophole that allows most of its products to enter the United States duty free.\nA spokesperson for Shein in a statement on Tuesday said the company has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labor and was \"eager to engage and continue to be transparent with all stakeholders, including Representative Wexton and her staff.\"\nShein has previously told Reuters it has no contract manufacturers in Xinjiang.\nA spokesperson for the SEC said the agency does not comment on any individual entity\u2019s filings.\nMegan Penick, a public securities lawyer at Michelman & Robinson, said it is unlikely to see a \"direct block\" from the SEC, but the agency could make the process difficult for Shein by making \"the disclosure requirements so detailed, and, perhaps extreme, that it makes it seem ... trying to go public cannot be achieved.\"\n\"There may be issues with the forced labor allegations and the IP (intellectual property) issues that may make it hard for (Shein) to be able to answer the questions to the satisfaction of the SEC,\" Penick said.\nLOBBYING CAPITOL HILL\nPublic disclosures show that Shein has spent $1.28 million on Capitol Hill lobbying this year as it prepares to go public.\nThe company has also met privately with lawmakers, including some of its biggest critics, in an effort to shift its reputation in Washington, according to several congressional aides.\nOne source familiar with the matter said that representatives for Shein emphasized the retailer\u2019s efforts to diversify its supply chain from China to other countries, including India.\nShein also touted its efforts to bring more China-made goods to the United States in bulk on traditional container ships, which requires paying tariffs on those items.\n\u201cShein is fundamentally a Chinese company and investors should approach Chinese offerings with extreme caution. Its attempt to go public should prompt a closer look at its business practices, especially its links to slave labor and its evasion of U.S. customs laws,\" Republican Sen. Marco Rubio told Reuters.\n\"I will closely monitor Shein's disclosures in the lead-up to its IPO,\u201d added Rubio, who in June criticized the retailer\u2019s lobbying efforts in a letter distributed to other senators.\nRepublican Representative Chris Smith, chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, has also criticized Shein's lobbying efforts.\n\u201cAny investor in this company should be wary of the material risks involved in Shein\u2019s business model ... particularly as Congress is demanding an end to forced labor and closure of import subsidies for Chinese companies,\u201d Smith said.\nINCREASED SCRUTINY\nIn its most recent social impact report, Shein highlighted its partnership with Oritain, a company also used by the U.S. government to test cotton for links to China\u2019s Xinjiang region.\nOritain CEO Grant Cochrane on Tuesday that the testing company conducted 2,762 tests of Shein yarn, fabric and finished products between August 2022 and November 2023 and that 1.7% tested positive for cotton from unapproved regions. The average prevalence of cotton from unapproved regions among brands that work with Oritain was 6% in 2023, according to the company.\nCritics, however, say that the testing does not adequately screen the millions of garments exported globally by Shein every year.\nPenick said that the SEC's handling of Shein's IPO will be crucial for other e-commerce players including ByteDance's TikTok and PDD Group's Temu, which may consider going public in the U.S. in the future.\nShein's IPO is \"going to be raising issues (for the SEC) that may later be applied across the board to all China-based or China-related companies that are going public,\" Penick said.\n(Reporting by Katherine Masters and Arriana Mclymore; Additional reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Mark Porter)",

You can say CIIE has become more of a political showcase rather than a business event,\" Carlo D'Andrea, the chamber's vice president, told reporters at a briefing in Shanghai.\n\"European businesses are becoming disillusioned as symbolic gestures take the place of tangible results needed to restore business confidence,\" he said.\nThe fair's organisers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has said it is willing to take more European exports in response to complaints from the European Union about the lack of a level playing field in China and the politicization of the business environment.\nThe EU and China plan a summit by the end of the year. The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, visited last month, as have several other top EU officials in recent months.\nA survey by the chamber last month that received 116 responses from its members found that participation rates had dropped from 42% to 32% since the first CIIE. Those who had opted not to attend this year after attending previously cited the diminishing value of investment and limited policy changes as among their reasons.\nAlthough 59% of the survey's respondents said they benefited from government engagement at the show, only a quarter of attendees closed any business deals at last year's CIIE, significantly lower than in 2018 when half of participants closed deals, the chamber added.\nEuropean businesses would like to see the CIIE \"move away from the politicization\" and focus on the business impact, as well as undertake concrete policy measures to open the market alongside the fair, the chamber added.\nMore than 60 countries and three international organisations, as well as 289 of the world's top 500 companies, will be participating in CIIE, according to Chinese state media, including firms such as Micron, Nestle and Burberry\nLast year, $73.52 billion worth of 'intentional' deals were signed at the fair, up 3.9%.\n($1 = 7.3142 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Sonali Paul)",

In the July announcement, the company said $800 million would come from reduced sales and marketing expenses and the remainder from \"all areas of the business, including engineering expense, travel, and administrative costs.\nIn April, GM said about 5,000 salaried workers had taken buyouts and agreed to leave the company, which would reduce fixed costs by about $1 billion annually, including a few hundred additional jobs cut in February.\nGM faces higher costs from a new labor agreement with the United Auto Workers union, including 11% immediate pay hikes and 25% through 2028.

        "text": "\nBy Andrew Chung and John Kruzel\nWASHINGTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is poised on Wednesday to consider the legality of the Securities and Exchange Commission's in-house proceedings to enforce investor-protection laws and impose penalties in a case that could broadly undercut the power of federal agencies.\nThe nine justices are due to hear arguments in an appeal by President Joe Biden's administration of a lower court's decision restricting the SEC's in-house tribunal system. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 ruled that the SEC's in-house proceedings violate the U.S. Constitution's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial and infringe on presidential and congressional powers.\nThe case involves hedge fund manager George Jarkesy, who the SEC fined and barred from the industry after determining he had committed securities fraud.\nA Supreme Court ruling in favor of Jarkesy could reduce or delay action against misconduct by brokers, investment advisers and others, and potentially frustrate enforcement at other agencies as well, according to legal experts.\nCritics of the SEC have said that it has an unfair advantage litigating cases before its own judges in \"administrative proceedings\" rather than before a jury in federal court. The SEC, which enforces various U.S. laws that protect investors, pursued 270 new in-house proceedings in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, compared to 231 in federal court.\nThe SEC in recent years has faced a series of legal attacks even as the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has signaled skepticism toward expansive federal regulatory power. The court in 2018 faulted the way the SEC selected its in-house judges, and in April made it easier for targets of agency actions to mount challenges in federal court.\nJarksey's challenge to the SEC is supported by numerous conservative and business groups, which have complained about the regulatory reach of the federal \"administrative state\" in areas such as energy, the environment, climate policy, workplace safety and financial regulation.\nThe SEC in 2011 began investigating Jarkesy, who founded two hedge funds with his Houston-based investment advisory firm, Patriot28 LLC. The funds had about 120 investors and roughly $24 million in assets under management.\nThe SEC's charges against Jarkesy and his firm proceeded before an in-house judge, who found that Jarkesy and his firm violated the Securities Act of 1933 and other laws including by misrepresenting the identity of the funds' auditor and value of the holdings. The agency then upheld the judge's findings.\nThe SEC ordered Jarkesy and his firm to pay a $300,000 civil penalty and Patriot28 to disgorge nearly $685,000 in ill-gotten gains.\nThe 5th Court threw out the SEC's decision. In addition to its conclusion about the right to a jury trial, the 5th Circuit found that Congress gave the SEC too much power to choose whether to bring cases in-house or in federal court, and that job protections for its administrative judges make them too difficult to remove, infringing on presidential powers under the Constitution.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of June.\nThe justices also are set to rule in the coming months on whether the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding structure conforms with the Constitution and could overturn a decades-old precedent that helps federal agencies defend regulatory actions in court. They heard arguments in that case in October.\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York and John Kruzel in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)",

Rapid cuts in methane emissions this decade are crucial if the world is to avoid severe climate change.\nAfter all-night talks, negotiators from EU member states and the European Parliament agreed to impose \"maximum methane intensity values\" by 2030 on producers abroad sending fossil fuels into Europe, the council of the EU, which represents member states, said in a statement.\nThe import rules are likely to hit major gas suppliers which include the U.S., Algeria and Russia. Moscow slashed deliveries to Europe last year and has since been replaced as Europe's biggest pipeline gas supplier by Norway, whose supply has among the world's lowest methane intensity.\n\"Finally, the EU tackles the second most important greenhouse gas with ambitious measures,\" said Jutta Paulus, the EU Parliament's co-lead negotiator, adding that the law \"will have repercussions worldwide\".\nPaulus told reporters importers will face financial penalties if they buy from foreign suppliers that don't comply with the limit - effectively imposing a fee on non-compliant fuels.\nThe methane standard would be mandatory for supply contracts signed after the law enters into force, likely later this year, after the European Parliament and EU countries give it final approval.\nThat step is usually a formality that waves through pre-agreed deals.\nA spokesperson for the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers said it is supportive of proportionate, efficient and implementable EU Methane Regulation but said there are still a lot of unknowns left to clarify in the legislation.\nThe EU's exact methane emissions limit will be set out by the European Commission before it applies.\nGreen group, the Environmental Defense Fund Europe said the measures send a clear signal ahead of the upcoming international climate talks in the United Arab Emirates, COP 28, that climate responsibilities don't end at county borders.\n\"As the world's biggest buyer of natural gas, the EU is strategically leveraging its economic influence to drive global reductions in methane emissions,\" Flavia Sollazzo, Senior Director, EU Energy Transition at EDF Europe said.\nMethane leaches into the atmosphere from leaky pipelines and infrastructure at oil and gas fields.\nThe regulation also introduces new requirements for the oil, gas and coal sectors to measure, report and verify methane emissions.\nThe deal obliges oil and gas producers in Europe to regularly check for and fix leaks of the potent greenhouse gas in their operations.\nIt also bans most cases of flaring and venting, when companies intentionally burn off or release unwanted methane into the atmosphere, from 2025 or 2027 depending on the type of infrastructure.\n(Reporting by Akanksha Khushi, Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru and Kate Abnett in Brussels, additional eporting by Susanna Twidale in London Editing by Gerry Doyle, Miral Fahmy, Jan Harvey, Alexandra Hudson)",

His sister Ivanka Trump also testified but is not a defendant.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and accused James, an elected Democrat, of \"election interference.\"\nDuring defiant and rambling testimony last week, Trump acknowledged inaccuracies on his financial statements but said the discrepancies were not relevant to the banks that used them to price his loans.\nDonald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump said they were not involved in preparing their father's financial statements and left bookkeeping at the Trump Organization to accountants.\nThe case is largely about damages, as Judge Engoron has already ruled that Trump and his company fraudulently inflated those asset values.\nEngoron has ordered the dissolution of companies that control pillars of Trump's real estate portfolio, including Trump Tower in Manhattan. That ruling is on hold pending appeal.\nTrump faces a maelstrom of legal troubles as he campaigns to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the 2024 election, though none have diminished his commanding lead over Republican rivals.\nHe is a defendant in four criminal trials, including two stemming from his attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss.

And there's not a single U.S. institutional investor that can't invest here,\" he said.\nMaassen praised initiatives like Germany's Financing for the Future Act, recently approved by the country's lower house of parliament, which lowers the requirements for start-ups to pursue an initial public offering and increases tax breaks for employee share schemes.\nThe EU is debating new legislation meant to simplify IPOs across the 27-member bloc known as the Listing Act.\nMaassen urged policymakers to speed up the implementation of the Capital Markets Union, a longstanding project to create a single market for capital beyond national borders.\n\"We need to build an EU framework that's implemented at country level,\" he said.\nSince Brexit, the European Union has had greater opportunity to deepen capital markets, as financial firms can no longer passport services from the UK and instead need to create hubs on the continent.\nEarlier this month, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde called for a capital markets union, with a single supervisor and trading infrastructure, to finance its digitalisation and green transition.\nEuropean startups attract less than half the funding of U.S. counterparts, Lagarde noted.\n($1 = 0.8025 pounds)\n(Reporting by Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro; Editing by Anousha Sakoui and Christina Fincher)",

        "text": "\n(Adds comment from Cruise, Teamsters union)\nBy Greg Bensinger\nSAN FRANCISCO, Oct 27 (Reuters) -\nGeneral Motors\u2019 autonomous vehicle unit, Cruise, is facing multiple federal investigations over its cars\u2019 safety, including two incidents where the robot cars appeared not to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, according to a U.S. regulator's letter released on Friday.\nCruise autonomous cars \"may not be exercising appropriate caution around pedestrians in the roadway,\" according to the letter dated Oct. 20 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \"This vehicle behavior could increase the risk of a collision with a pedestrian which in turn may result in injury or death.\"\nNHTSA previously made public another Oct. 20 letter in which it raised concerns over several hard-braking incidents by Cruise vehicles that resulted in collisions.\nSafety officials cited two videos where Cruise vehicles came close to pedestrians in crosswalks and appeared to nearly strike them. In one, the vehicle is observed steering toward a pedestrian walking a dog, before braking, causing the pedestrian to pause and pull back on the leash. In the other, the car appears to narrowly avoid striking four pedestrians in a crosswalk, including two small children, before it continues down the street.\nAsked about the videos, Cruise said on Friday the vehicles were tracking all pedestrians in both cases and that it has \"made improvements as part of our process of continuously enhancing our technology to give pedestrians more space around our vehicles.\"\nThe company said of NHTSA's inquiries that it \"cooperated with each of their requests to date as part of the ongoing investigation process and will continue doing so.\"\nNHTSA said it was seeking additional information from Cruise about the pedestrian incidents including all videos running from at least 30 seconds before and after each event and composite renderings. The agency is seeking the information by the end of Oct. 27.\nThe NHTSA probes add to Cruise\u2019s October woes after the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered the driverless cars to be removed from state roads, calling them a public hazard and alleging the company had \"misrepresented\" the safety of the technology.\nCruise had been operating an Uber-like service with unmanned vehicles, primarily in San Francisco, but the company halted that service this week. It is still allowed in the state to test autonomous cars with human safety drivers.\nCruise is competing with Alphabet\u2019s Waymo unit, and others, to develop the robot cars for wider production and deployment. Perfecting the technology will take years of real- world testing, but the companies have run in to resistance from some lawmakers and citizens who said they fear the vehicles are as yet unproven and pose a safety risk.\nCruise and Waymo have deployed the cars in several states in addition to California, including Arizona and Texas. As of Friday, Waymo vehicles continued driverless passenger operations in San Francisco, its main hub.\nThe Teamsters union, which has publicly opposed the broad rollout of autonomous vehicles, said Cruise's decision to pause driverless operations nationwide \"is a major concession by the industry.\"\n\"It\u2019s a cautionary tale of what happens when we let AV companies govern themselves.\"\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger in San Francisco Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "text": "\nBy Balazs Koranyi\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - The euro zone appears to be in the middle of another recession but worries about whether definitive growth figures due early next year will have a plus or minus sign in front are missing the bigger picture.\nThe good news is that the 20-nation currency union is set to avoid a deep contraction that could scar firms, households and banks for years. The bad news is that growth is hovering around zero with little out there to fuel a meaningful recovery.\nEconomic headwinds are so strong that next year will also be challenging and fading growth potential suggests the euro zone would struggle to expand much more than 1% even with a robust rebound.\nDeep structural problems mean Europe is bound to trail most other big economic areas for years to come.\nNEAR TERM\nThe short term outlook is not great - but not terrible.\nData on Tuesday showed gross domestic product shrank 0.1% in July-September from the previous three months, pointing to a shallow recession, if a weak fourth quarter follows as early indicators suggest.\nBut growth has been broadly flat all year and record-high interest rates - a byproduct of the inflation surge - along with tighter budget spending will limit expansion to just 0.6% next year, according to a Reuters poll.\nOptimists, including the European Central Bank's chief economist Philip Lane, say that demand should recover as workers are now enjoying a rebound in real wages that will boost confidence.\nThe labour market remains tight and the world economy is rebounding, so external demand is also likely to be healthier.\nBut others say there is little to suggest the sort of rebound in confidence the ECB is banking on, citing high borrowing costs that hold back investment, a softening labour market and overseas demand falling short of what was hoped.\n\"Europe has been through a year of zero-growth and is now heading into a year in which both monetary and fiscal policies are designed to put a brake on growth,\" UniCredit economics advisor Erik Nielsen said.\n\"The European economy has been flat on its back for a year (and) the monetary and fiscal policy plans for 2024 seem to accept the high probability of another lost year.\"\nPOOR TREND\nThe outlook remains poor beyond next year.\nEurope's working-age population is set to shrink while productivity gains are small. Businesses complain that bureaucracy is increasing, making them less competitive, while the euro zone's integration into an economic union has stalled with little apparent political will to move forward.\nThe European Commission now puts the bloc's potential growth at less than 1.5%, shrinking to 1.2% by 2027, a decline from 2%-2.5% at the turn of the century and due mainly to demographic shifts and weak efficiency gains.\n\"Many countries, where they were in the 1990s, they're behind that now. There's not been progress - there has been regress,\" the ECB's Lane said recently.\n\"Over time, various types of reforms have been cancelled, various types of reforms been unwound. This is an avoidable own-goal,\" he added.\nPotential growth in the United States is meanwhile seen at around 1.8% and holding steady.\nThe drop in Europe's working-age population could also come with a quirk. Fearing it will be difficult to hire in future, firms are now hanging onto workers, creating even more labour market tightness, potentially fuelling wage growth and weakening productivity.\n\"A structural shortage of qualified labour, aggravated by the demographic transition and skill mismatches, is prompting companies to hoard labour despite rising cost pressures and economic uncertainty,\" UBS economist Reinhard Cluse said.\nGermany appears to be the biggest drag. Its energy-intensive heavy industries rely on external demand for growth, leaving it poorly prepared for the new realities of expensive energy and trade tensions.\nThe potential growth rate for Europe's largest economy is now below 1%.\nEuropean Union governments are meanwhile struggling to reach consensus on bigger questions that will help shape the future. These include what role migration should play in alleviating labour shortages, whether to form a true banking union, and if they should use centralised spending to tackle issues across the 27-nation bloc.\n\"Rather than being satisfied with growth rates around 1.2% on average, let's be more ambitious,\" Lane said.\n(Editing by Mark John and Catherine Evans)",

We're not reducing people. But we have some sites that will have to shrink. It's decorative paints in Europe, and it's coatings in Europe and in the U.S.,\" Poux-Guillaume said in a interview with Reuters.\nAkzo has been recovering from a post-COVID slowdown last year, marked by rising raw material costs and destocking activity in its decorative do-it-yourself segment in Europe.\nThe Amsterdam-based company said it now targeted around 1.45 billion euros in adjusted core earnings (EBITDA) for 2023, at the lower end of its previous guidance between 1.4 and 1.55 billion.\nThe company has been passing on steep raw material costs to customers through price rises, hiking them 3% in the third quarter, but Poux-Guillaume signalled the increases ending except in hyperinflation-ridden countries, as costs have started to ease.\n\"I think price increases sequentially have mostly come to an end. Or we're back to normal market conditions,\" he said.\nCFO Maarten de Vries said raw material deflation trends were foreseeable for the next quarter and the first half of 2024, saying Akzo was \"still on a trajectory to restore our margins\".\nPoux-Guillaume told a press call that the company had seen flat volumes, but had achieved a better performance than its peers. \"It's a reflection of what we see in our competitors,\" he said about the updated guidance, which is slightly below the 1.47 billion euros expected by analysts in a company-provided consensus.\n\"Overall, in line adj EBIT print/adj EPS miss and somewhat weaker 4Q guide than consensus will likely limit the enthusiasm on the stock,\" J.P.

        "text": "\nLast month, a real estate agent in Patty Zuzek\u2019s office got a call about selling a plot of land.\nThe caller, who had heard about the real estate agency through a Facebook post wanted to sell the vacant lot $75,000 below the market value. The caller\u2019s only request was that the transaction be in cash.\n\u201cWhat they wanted was a quick deal,\u201d Zuzek, a broker with Fieldstone Real Estate Specialists in Minnesota, told Yahoo Finance.\nZuzek\u2019s colleague found a buyer, who was a builder. When the purchase agreement on the property came in, the builder buying the property put a \u201cbuild your custom home\u201d sign on the lot.\nTwo days later, the property owner contacted the builder.\n\u201c\u2018Get your sign off my lot,\u2019\u201d Zuzek said the owner told them. \u201cThat property is not for sale.\u201d\nIt turned out that Zuzek\u2019s coworker fell victim to a growing type of fraud across the country: scammers trying to sell land they don\u2019t own.\nIn 2022, the FBI received 11,727 real estate-related complaints with losses of over $396 million, an 86% increase versus 2020 levels. Earlier this year, the US Secret Service, in conjunction with CertifID Inc., which offers wire fraud protection services, put out an advisory over the \u201csharp increase in reports of real estate fraud associated with vacant and unencumbered properties.\u201d\nAnd a Secret Service representative at the New York field office told Yahoo Finance on Friday that these scams are becoming a bigger issue and she frequently takes calls on the matter.\n\u201cThis is a very new crime that's being committed in the United States,\u201d Tyler Adams, CEO at CertifID, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt almost didn't exist in previous years and compared to what we've seen this year.\u201d\nRead more: 6 tips to avoid credit card fraud and scams this holiday season\nThe notion of selling someone\u2019s property without them knowing might seem unthinkable. But it's happening more often than not.\nData from CertifID shows that 77% of real estate professionals surveyed reported seeing an increase in seller impersonation fraud attempts within the last six months, with 54% experiencing at least one seller impersonation fraud attempt during that period.\nFraudsters are becoming savvy in using publicly available records to impersonate the owner of a vacant property to benefit from the sale. The current housing landscape hasn\u2019t helped either. Real estate agents are more vulnerable and desperate for a potential deal as the inventory of homes to sell remains historically low.\n\u201cIf you're a real estate agent, two years ago you were doing 12 or 20 deals a month, and now you're doing one and somebody shows up and says, \u2018Hey, I want to sell my vacant land.\u2019 That looks like gold to a real estate agent who hasn't done a deal in a long time,\u201d Adams said.\nSome fraudulent sellers are getting away with minimal paperwork to prove they actually own the place and are able to conduct transactions via phone and email using fake IDs to impersonate owners, Zuzek said.\nScammers \u201care going to do everything in the world to try to make you think you're talking to the right person or you're communicating with the right person and those tactics are going to get harder and harder to detect,\u201d Adams said.\nIt also is more difficult to spot a scam if the property is vacant, which is the type of property many of these fraudsters are targeting.\n\u201cThe focus of the scam is vacant parcels and unoccupied properties that are lien-free,\u201d Deanne Rymarowicz, associate counsel for the National Association of Realtors, told Yahoo Finance.\nFor a buyer caught up in one of these scams, a lot of legwork awaits them. The buyer has to regain any money they lost through a title insurance claim, a process that could be very aggravating and time-consuming, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nSo far, CertifID has helped 378 customers, who have fallen victim to this type of scam, with 60% of those representing buyers.\nFor Zuzek\u2019s coworker, once the police got involved two weeks later, the real estate firm stepped back and let them take the lead. Zuzek said the builder will get back the money they paid already once the original owner of the property files a complaint with authorities.\n\u201cIt'll just take some time,\u201d Zuzek said.\n\"What's interesting is I go around and speak at different offices and talk with other brokers, and it's amazing how many people are like, \u2018that's just happening to one of our agents,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt's like, wow, this is like a plague.\u201d\n\u2014\nDani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\nBy Leigh Thomas\nPARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The global economy will slow slightly next year but the risk of a hard landing has subsided despite high levels of debt and uncertainty over interest rates, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Wednesday.\nGlobal growth is set to moderate from 2.9% this year to 2.7% in 2024 before picking up in 2025 to 3.0%, the Paris-based policy forum said in its latest Economic Outlook.\nGrowth in advanced economies that make up the OECD's 38 members was seen headed for a soft landing with the United States holding up better than expected so far.\nThe OECD forecast U.S. growth would slow from 2.4% this year to 1.5% next year, revising up its estimates from September when it predicted U.S. growth of 2.2% in 2023 and 1.3% in 2024.\nThough the risk of a hard landing in the United States and elsewhere had eased, the OECD said that the risk of recession was not off the table given weak housing markets, high oil prices and sluggish lending.\nChina's economy was also expected to slow as it grapples with a deflating real estate bubble and consumers save more in the face of greater uncertainty about the outlook.\nIts growth was seen easing from 5.2% this year to 4.7% in 2024 - both marginally higher than expected in September - before slowing further in 2025 to 4.2%, the OECD forecast.\nIn the euro area, growth was seen picking up from 0.6% this year to 0.9% in 2024 and 1.1% in 2025 as Germany - the region's largest economy - emerged from a recession this year.\nNonetheless, the OECD warned that, because of the high level of bank financing in the euro zone, the full impact of interest rate hikes remained uncertain and could weigh more on growth than expected.\nMeanwhile, Japan, the only major advanced economy yet to hike interest rates in the current cycle, was expected to see growth slow from 1.7% this year to 1.0% in 2024 before picking up to 1.2% in 2024.\nWhile countries' growth outlooks were diverging, they shared similar fiscal pressures with debt burdens projected to keep rising for years to come in G7 countries, the OECD warned.

        "text": "\nBy Tim Hepher\nPARIS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Europe's top space official said on Tuesday there was \"light at the end of tunnel\" in efforts to bring the delayed Ariane 6 to the launchpad and restore Europe's independent access to space.\nEurope's new heavyweight launch vehicle has been delayed by technical glitches, leaving the continent relying on Elon Musk's SpaceX for some launches until some time in 2024.\nJosef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency (ESA), said a more precise 2024 launch period would be defined following a delayed long-duration firing test due on Nov. 23.\n\"I think it is fair to say we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel. We are hopeful that we are on a good path for the first flight,\" Aschbacher told the AJPAE French aerospace media association.\nAschbacher was speaking as attention turns to the next phase of funding for the new launcher ahead of a meeting of European space ministers to be held in Seville, Spain, on Nov. 6-7.\nThe ESA's 22 nations have agreed funds for an inaugural test flight and 14 operational missions. Now, they are seeking an accord on the next phase of \"stabilised\" operations, covering flights 16 to 42.\nAschbacher declined to comment on the state of negotiations ahead of the Seville \"Space Summit\", which is also due to address climate change and Europe's ambitions in space exploration.\nPeople familiar with the matter said there had been progress in narrowing differences between the three largest launch nations - France, Germany and Italy - in recent days, but that any funding round would depend on agreement of smaller nations.\nThe previous generation of rocket for heavy payloads, Ariane 5, was retired in July. The smaller Vega C has been grounded since Dec. 22 after a failed launch.\nEurope's third traditional path to space, the Russian Soyuz programme, was interrupted last year amid the breakdown in East-West relations following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nThose developments have left Europe scrambling to close the gap in launch capability as space increasingly becomes an arena for economic and strategic competition.\n\"We are in a launcher crisis ... This is something that is highly critical for Europe,\" Aschbacher said.\nA task force comprising the heads of ArianeGroup - the Airbus/Safran joint-venture responsible for building Ariane 6 - operator Arianespace, French space agency CNES - which runs the launchpad - and the ESA meets every 10-14 days.\nAschbacher also highlighted efforts to give Europe a greater presence in exploration as India and China make new strides.\nA group of experts including former NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen urged the ESA this year to increase its autonomy in human and robotic space exploration. Europe currently relies on the United States, and until recently Russia, to carry astronauts.\nBut such plans have come up against budget constraints and competing priorities amid war in Ukraine and now the Middle East.\nPeople familiar with the matter said that in the absence of new funds ministers meeting in Spain next week could kickstart a project to create a reusable cargo vehicle.\nSuch a move could benefit from a relatively modest seed funding in an attempt to kickstart private investment.\nBut in Europe's system of horse-trading for space funding, any agreement on exploration is likely to depend on progress on the critical issue of Ariane 6 funding, the people said.

        "text": "\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The National Retail Federation, the nation\u2019s largest retail trade group, expects shoppers will spend more this year than last year, but their spending pace will slow given all the economic uncertainty.\nThe group forecast Thursday that U.S. holiday sales will rise 3% to 4% for November through December, compared with a 5.4% growth of a year ago. Sales for the two-month period will increase to between $957.3 billion and $966.6 billion, the group predicted.\nThe pace is consistent with the average annual holiday increase of 3.6% from 2010 to pre-pandemic 2019. Americans ramped up spending during the pandemic, which accounted for some outsized sales numbers. For the holiday 2021 season, sales for the two-month period surged 12.7%.\nThe forecast comes as shoppers keep spending, powered by sturdy hiring, low unemployment and healthy household finances. That's despite still higher prices \u2014 though inflation has eased \u2014 and higher interest rates that make getting a mortgage or borrowing on credit cards more expensive. Not to mention shoppers' gloomy sentiment based on multiple surveys.\nBut bad news keeps piling up including the threat of a government shutdown, the resumption of student loan repayments and new global tensions tied to the Oct. 7 surprise attack by Hamas in Israel. Analysts say that shoppers could become rattled if the Israel-Hamas war is not contained, particularly heading into the final weeks of the critical holiday season. And consumers are turning more to savings and credit cards to help finance their spending. In fact, retailers have reported a rise in credit card delinquency rates.\n\u201cI think our sense is that the cumulative effect of all of these things is going to show some moderation in consumer behavior relative to the last several years of holiday spending,\u201d Matt Shay, president and CEO of the National Retail Federation, told reporters on Thursday.\nA lot is riding on what happens during the holiday season. It's a strong barometer of shoppers' willingness to spend and could affect what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates. The central bank has been trying to cool spending and hiring with multiple rate hikes. On Wednesday, the Fed kept its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight time but left the door open to further rate hikes if inflation pressures increase in the months ahead.\nThe forecast from the retail trade group considers a variety of indicators including employment, wages, consumer confidence, disposable income, consumer credit, previous retail sales and weather. The numbers exclude automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants.\nIt is in line with many holiday forecasts from research and consulting firms pointing to a sales slowdown from last year.\nMastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment forms including cash, expects U.S. retail sales excluding automotive to increase by 3.7% from November to late December, a decline from the 7.6% sales growth experienced last year. The consulting firm Deloitte expects holiday sales to jump between 3.5% and 4.6%.\nCraig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a consulting and research firm serving the retail sector, is less optimistic, expecting sales to be up just 2.1%. But if inflation eases in the future and if job growth \u2014 and real wages \u2014 rise in 2024, he said retail sales could return to a healthy pace of 5% to 6%.\nThe forecasts, including NRF's. are not adjusted for inflation. Measures of U.S. inflation barely declined in September, evidence that consumer price increases are grinding lower at a gradual pace. Year-over-year inflation was unchanged at 3.7% as of September compared with a year ago.\nMany retailers are also pushing holiday merchandise earlier this year compared to a year ago as shoppers try to stretch their buying in an inflationary environment, part of a recent trend.\nDuring the height of the pandemic in 2020, stores pushed shoppers to buy earlier and buy online to avoid big crowds in the stores. Then the following year, clogs in the supply network led to shoppers seeking to get a head start on shopping, afraid they wouldn\u2019t get the items they wanted if they waited.\nKohl\u2019s said it began displaying its holiday merchandise during the first week of October, a few weeks earlier than last year. It\u2019s also simplifying its discount signs at the store to make it easier for shoppers to find deals. But shoppers are still splurging on items like trendy clothing and beauty items.\n\u201cWe know they\u2019re stretched,\u201d said Christie Raymond, Kohl\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cWe\u2019re watching their credit card debt ... Their savings have started to dwindle. We know they\u2019ve got those loans as well. With that said, they are spending and they\u2019re shopping.\u201d\nBut she said U.S. consumers are being \u201creally thoughtful with where they\u2019re putting their dollars.\u201d\n___\nFollow Anne D\u2019Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio",

The technical glitch froze trading on a number of benchmark indexes, with a flat line displayed on intraday charts for the duration of the disruption.\nGauges affected include the blue-chip UK FTSE 100 Index, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB and the South Africa benchmark, known as the JALSH, data provided by Bloomberg showed. There\u2019s no sign that the incident affected individual stocks, which were trading as usual.\nAn outage earlier in the day on the Refinitiv FX trading platform, also owned by LSEG, disrupted trading in the Indian rupee, according to people familiar with the matter. The currency weakened to a record low on Friday. The \u201ctechnical incident\u201d affected the platform\u2019s FX Matching service between 6:33 and 7:03 a.m. London time, an LSEG spokesman said.\nThe disruption, which comes after a similar incident in mid-October, is a further setback for the UK\u2019s main exchange provider that\u2019s facing a shrinking market as a growing number of companies move their listings elsewhere. A lack of initial public offerings, along with a flurry of takeovers by overseas and private equity firms, mean there are more companies leaving the UK market than joining it, according to a recent research report from investment bank Peel Hunt.\n\u201cThis is a headache the LSEG could do without, given it comes during a year when the London Stock Exchange has struggled to attract IPOs and seen a number of listed firms bought out by private equity firms,\u201d said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\u201cAverage daily traded volumes also dropped in the third quarter, year-on-year, part of a trend that\u2019s been underway since the financial crisis.\u201d\nIn October, trading on hundreds of shares was halted in the final 80 minutes of a session. The interruption affected mostly smaller-cap equities. Stocks on the FTSE 100 Index, FTSE 250 and International Order Book weren\u2019t affected, LSEG said at the time.\nLSEG, which is due to hold a capital markets day next week, has been focused on building tech for its clients. Microsoft Corp. agreed late last year to buy a 4% stake in the exchange provider in a $2.8 billion cloud-computing deal.\nThe parent company of Bloomberg News competes with LSEG to provide financial news, data and information.\n--With assistance from Chiara Remondini, Antonio Vanuzzo and Anup Roy.\n(Updates to add backgroung throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

        "text": "\nBRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 As distant as the prospect of peace might seem, European Union leaders believe it is time to start laying the foundations for a future relationship between Israel and the Palestinians where the militant group Hamas doesn't control Gaza.\nMindful that resentment and even conflict in the wider Middle East and Gulf regions have been fueled by decades of tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, the 27-nation bloc has begun exploring ways to realize a long-held EU ideal \u2014 two states living peacefully side by side.\nAs the Palestinian death toll climbed beyond 7,000 and Israel carried out airstrikes on Friday in response to the Hamas incursion into southern Israel, EU leaders meeting in Brussels for a second day encouraged broader diplomatic and security initiatives to stop the conflict from spreading, and ultimately from ever starting again. A peace conference and political settlement would be part of that.\n\u201cThe history of this conflict didn\u2019t begin with the attacks on Oct. 7 and won\u2019t end with a land war in Gaza,\u201d Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very clear: 75 years of conflict between Israel and the Arabs, wars, terrorist attacks, huge instability. This won\u2019t end because of a military solution. It can\u2019t.\u201d\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said that \u201ca pure security policy and a pure security solution is part of the reason (this conflict) has happened. So at some point a political dialogue needs to start.\u201d\nApart from its aid and trade leverage, the EU bloc has no obvious security role to play in the conflict. It backs Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Hamas, which killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. Hamas is holding at least 229 captives inside Gaza, including dozens of EU citizens.\nBut as civilian casualties in Gaza mount, it also wants Israel to respect international law. Hamas is on the EU\u2019s list of terror organizations and receives no funding from the bloc. Indeed, a review of its substantial assistance to the Palestinians is underway to ensure that none leaks to the group.\nThe EU member nations have long been divided in their positions on the region \u2014 Austria, Germany and Hungary staunch backers of Israel, Spain and Ireland more vocal in their support for the Palestinians \u2014 but the bloc does have credibility as a European project founded on peace.\n\u201cAll 27 countries agreed to this,\u201d Varadkar told reporters. \u201cThat there should be a two-state solution, and that we need to have a peace conference, and that the European Union needs to be part of that.\u201d\nThe EU has for years tried to promote the idea of an Israeli and a Palestinian state with borders set mostly as they were in 1967 \u2014 before Israel captured and occupied the West Bank and Gaza \u2014 with some land swaps agreed between them. Both would have Jerusalem as their shared capital.\nIn a statement agreed overnight, the leaders said they are \u201cready to contribute to reviving a political process on the basis of the two-state solution.\u201d They also said the EU \u201cwelcomes diplomatic peace and security initiatives and supports the holding of an international peace conference soon.\u201d\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said that the peace conference must be held within six months.\nIt will mean working more closely with Israel\u2019s neighbors, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, as well as with Gulf countries like Qatar, which has the kind of relations with Hamas that could help get hostages released. Iran\u2019s demands would have to be managed. Saudi Arabia and Turkey could play key roles.\nTop EU officials concede that their international peace efforts so far haven't been effective. This is the fifth war between Israel and Hamas, and the number of deaths in the past three weeks exceeds the combined tally of those killed in the previous four, which is estimated to be around 4,000.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop this cycle of violence, it will happen again in the future. The level of trust between Israeli and Palestinian, which was already extremely low in recent years, is now at the level of the Dead Sea,\u201d EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote in a blog this week.\n\u201cPeace will not come by itself; it has to be built,\u201d added Borrell, who leads international diplomatic efforts on behalf of the EU. \u201cThe two-state solution remains the only viable one we know. And if we only have one solution, we must put all our political energy into achieving it.\u201d",

        "text": "\nApple (AAPL), on Monday, announced its latest MacBook Pro lineup and updated iMac during its prime time Scary Fast virtual event. Each of the systems come equipped with the company\u2019s new M3 line of chips, which feature a new graphics architecture for improved performance in gaming and graphics-intensive apps.\nThe Pros come in 14-inch and 16-inch varieties and include Apple\u2019s Liquid Retina XDR display, a 1080p camera, six-speaker sound system, and Apple\u2019s macOS Sonoma operating system. But it\u2019s the chips that make these laptops stand apart from their predecessors.\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch is available with the entry-level M3, mid-range M3 Pro, and top-of-the-line M3 Max. The MacBook Pro 16-inch is available with the M3 Pro and the M3 Max. The MacBook Pro 14-inch with M3 starts at $1,599, while the version with the 14-inch with the M3 Pro starts at $1,999. The MacBook Pro 16-inch starts at $2,499.\nAll of the chips use 3-nanometer technology and come with Apple\u2019s new Dynamic Caching GPU technology, which the company says is designed to ensure software is getting the most out of the GPU\u2019s available resources. Overall, Apple says the M3 line is a major upgrade over the first-generation M1 line of chips, as well as older Intel-based MacBooks.\nAccording to the company, the M3 MacBook Pros offer 7.4x faster render performance in Final Cut Pro than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel (INTC) Core i7 chip, and 60% faster performance than the 13-inch Pro with an M1 chip. Excel is also 3.5x faster than the Intel model and 40% faster than the M1 system.\nThe MacBook Pro with Apple\u2019s M3 Pro chip offers 3x faster performance using Photoshop\u2019s filter and function than an Intel-based Pro and 40% faster performance than a MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro.\nAs for the M3 Max-powered MacBook Pro, Apple says the laptop offers 5.3x faster render performance than an Intel-based MacBook Pro in Maxon Redshift and 2.5x faster performance than a Pro using the M1 Max chip.\nMacBook Pros outfitted with the M3 Max and M3 Pro chip are also available in an exclusive space black finish that uses an anodized shield to dramatically cut down on fingerprints.\nApple\u2019s MacBook Pros have traditionally been marketed toward content creators, whether those are animators or video and photo editors. But the company is increasingly looking to target a broader swath of consumers, aiming the latest generation of MacBook Pros at everyone from small business owners and students to gamers and medical professionals.\nApple is looking to make strides in gaming in particular, with the company offering a look at how the latest Pros handle games like \u201cLies of P\u201d and showing off their ability to take advantage of hardware-accelerated ray tracing to provide more accurate, realistic lighting.\nIt\u2019s clear that Apple isn\u2019t just looking to win over creators anymore; it\u2019s hoping to get all consumers on board with its most powerful laptops.\nThe latest iMac, meanwhile, starts at $1,299 and comes with Apple\u2019s new M3 chip and up to 24GB of memory. That, Apple says, makes the 24-inch all-in-one 2x faster than an iMac with an M1 chip. The system also offers a 30% performance boost while using Excel and 30% jump in Safari performance.\nApple says the M3-equipped desktop is 4x faster than an Intel-powered 21.5-inch iMac, and 2.5x faster than the 27-inch iMac with an Intel chip.\nWhile Apple is in its third generation of M processors, there are still plenty of Intel-powered Macs in the wild. And drawing distinctions between those older systems and its latest and greatest is a surefire way to draw consumer interest.\nThe MacBook Pros and iMac come as the PC industry is set for a rebound after two years of declines. According to research firm Gartner, PC shipments, which include Apple\u2019s MacBooks, declined 9% in the third quarter. But the sector is headed for growth in the fourth quarter, the firm said.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks will grab the spotlight on Wednesday.\nUncertainty about the timing of potential rate cuts and some dismal corporate forecasts for the fourth quarter have cast a doubt on whether there could be a year-end rally for stocks.\n\"The chatter of potentially higher-for-longer rates, growing signs of slowing global economy and the rising recession odds don\u2019t offer a bright outlook for equities into the year end,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.\n\"Seasonally speaking, November and December are known to be good months for the S&P500 stocks.

        "text": "\nBy Marie Mannes\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) -U.S. hedge fund Fir Tree Partners, a bondholder in property group SBB, said on Monday the Swedish company's debt buyback offer placed too much weight on the interests of shareholders and did not address its obligations to creditors.\nLoss-making SBB, which is at the centre of a wider Swedish property crash, said on Thursday it would offer to buy back hybrid and senior securities for up to $650 million as the group looks to cut debt on its balance sheet.\nIn response, credit rating agency S&P on Friday placed SBB on credit watch for a potential downgrade to a selective default, as purchasing debt at a substantial discount to the original amount could be considered tantamount to default.\n\"SBB appears to be devoting its scarce resources to preserving equity value, rather than focusing on near- and long-term senior obligations,\" Fir Tree said in an \"open letter\" to fellow bondholders.\nFir Tree, which said it holds bonds maturing in 2028 and 2029, also questioned SBB's offer to buy back hybrid notes with no maturity, arguing that this was not required.\nThe hedge fund urged bondholders to consider Fir Tree's concerns before potentially participating in the tender offer, whose deadline is Nov. 22.\nSBB was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters.\nEarlier this month Fir Tree requested that SBB immediately repay a bond, saying the group was in breach of a debt clause, a claim the company has denied.\nDanske bank credit analyst Marcus Gustavsson said Fir Tree raised some important questions in its open letter such as why SBB was offering to buy back hybrid bonds.\n\"It was also why we (Danske Bank) were a bit surprised to see the tender offer to begin with,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Marie Mannes; Editing by Terje Solsvik and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

COP28 climate summit in Dubai clarified his statements a day earlier that Brazil would \"participate\" in OPEC+.\n\"Brazil should join OPEC+, it could be an observer,\" Lula said on Sunday. \"Brazil will never be a full member of OPEC, because we don't want to be.

        "text": "\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 A flagship EU law intended to push European companies toward net zero faces being seriously weakened by member states, a confidential document passed to The Associated Press reveals, with firms seemingly no longer forced to implement Paris Agreement goals.\nThe Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive was designed to make companies eliminate environmental and human rights violations throughout all areas of their business. The legislation was meant to ensure firms\u2019 operations were aligned with a global rise in temperatures of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).\nBut a Nov. 9 briefing obtained by The AP details a watered-down proposal that would drop the entire financial sector from the initial law.\nBanks and insurers are among Europe\u2019s biggest contributors to global warming, by financing or insuring new oil and gas projects, or agribusinesses that chop down tropical rainforests. Nonprofits also warn the new proposal would mean firms merely need to have plans to hit low carbon targets, not actually deliver them \u2013 a recipe for greenwashing.\nWhen it was unveiled, environmentalists hailed the law. But there\u2019s currently a standoff on the final text between the European Parliament, which wants tough legislation, and the Council of the European Union, formed of ministers from all 27 member countries.\nMany of the latter want less onerous provisions, worried about the impact of stringent regulation on their economies.\nSpain currently holds the council\u2019s presidency, and is trying to get all the member states to agree on their desired version of the law. Its attempt at breaking the impasse was set out in the confidential briefing.\nThe proposed rules on the financial sector had led to \u201cdifficult problems to overcome in working out a reasonable landing zone\u201d with the European Parliament, it said. As a solution, \u201cthe Presidency proposes \u2026 a possible exclusion of the financial sector which would delay the extension to the financial sector to a later stage.\u201d\nThis came as a shock to campaigners, who warn if it\u2019s kicked into the long grass, the inclusion of finance may never happen. The next European elections are due in June 2024, and many believe after that the chance to add to it will be gone.\nAs part of its plan to become climate neutral by 2050, the European Union has adopted a wide range of measures, from reducing energy consumption to sharply cutting transportation emissions and reforming the EU\u2019s trading system for greenhouse gases. But with the elections looming, some leaders and lawmakers are concerned about antagonizing voters with binding legislation and restrictive requirements.\nAs recently as October, the council's proposal was to create laws for the financial sector that individual nation states could opt in or out of.\nRichard Gardiner, head of EU policy at the World Benchmarking Alliance, a Dutch nonprofit that examines the sustainability of global companies, called the current approach a \u201cmassive rowback on the progress made.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you exclude finance you exclude a major driver of change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes against the majority views of the EU parliament, Commission and most member states,\u201d he added, questioning the \u201cundue influence\" of large countries \"willing to pander to the financial sector\u2019s lobbying needs.\u201d\nRen\u00e9 Repasi, lead negotiator on the law\u2019s financial clauses, said in a phone interview that finance was the fuel of the world economy and fundamentally connected to the environment.\nHe laid the blame for the change firmly at the door of France, but said he was yet to hear a credible or convincing argument justifying their stance. A deal on finance was previously supported by all member states, he revealed. \u201cAnd then in a last minute move, France said they will veto it.\u201d\n\u201cFrance is the driving factor,\u201d he said.\nA document authored by French officials last November obtained by The AP shows it proposed removing legal obligations for the financial sector to address environmental harms linked to its financing activities. Meanwhile, minutes from an EU meeting this October also seen by AP show France \u201cspoke out against the proposal and against all options\u201d then proposed on finance.\nA source in the French negotiation team said on the phone, \u201cFrance supports the exclusion of the financial sector from the scope of the directive.\n\u201cBut France supports a certain number of dispositions that reinforce obligations of the financial sector in the framework of this directive.\u201d\n\u201cWe know companies are responsible for the vast majority of climate-wrecking emissions,\u201d said Alban Grosdidier, of Friends of the Earth Europe. He warned the proposed changes would make the new law \u201cweak and unenforceable.\u201d\nAnd Grosdidier said another clause, forcing companies to adhere to the Paris Agreement, would be left toothless by the changes. The European Parliament wants member states to ensure their companies implement a plan to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. But the council\u2019s preferred version would merely order companies to \u201cadopt a plan\u201d aligned with the Paris Agreement, along with some actions.\nThey also want to amend the enforcement of the bill to make clear that nations need only police whether plans have been \u201cadopted.\u201d The implication, campaigners say, is that these plans wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to be delivered.\nThe leaked briefing shows the EU Presidency now prefers the weaker regulation, nonprofits warn. As a \u201cproposed solution\u201d to the standoff, it said companies should show an \u201cobligation of means\u201d to align with the Paris Agreement.\nIn legal terms, an \u201cobligation of results\u201d would have been much stronger, said Marion Lupin, a lawyer and policy officer at the European Coalition for Corporate Justice.\n\u201cUse of the phrase \u2018obligation of means\u2019 here has the effect of meaning companies only need to have a plan for aligning with Paris, as opposed to actually implementing that plan,\u201d said Romain Hubert, a research fellow at Paris-based analysts the Institute for Climate Economics.\nFriends of the Earth\u2019s Grosdidier said the new proposed could even be counterproductive, as the adoption of a plan with no duty to implement was a \u201clicense to greenwash.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Spanish presidency of the EU Council declined to comment.\nAmbassadors of member countries are due to discuss the new proposals Wednesday. If they agree on them, they will form the basis for the final negotiation with the European Parliament. Once negotiators from all side will have brokered a compromise, it will need to get formal approval from both the parliament and council to become a law across the bloc with about 450 million citizens.\n\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

        "text": "\nAMD (AMD) reported its third quarter earnings Tuesday after the bell, but not all the chips fell its way.\nWhile it beat estimates on the top and bottom line, the company missed on its Q4 guidance. AMD's shares fell about 4% in after-hours trading, but gained back the loss after optimism about its latest data center chips grew. The stock is up 8% on Wednesday.\nIn Q3, AMD reeled in $5.8 billion in revenue and $0.70 in EPS, but forecasted $6.1 billion in revenue for the next quarter, missing analysts' expectations of $6.4 billion.\nAmid the AI boom, AMD is playing catch-up with Nvidia (NVDA), which currently rules the roost when it comes to AI chips. But the underdog has been making headway \u2014 AMD CEO Lisa Su recently made the case that the AI field is more wide open than it might appear right now.\n\"I'm not a believer in moats when the market is moving as fast as this,\" Su told the audience at the 2023 Code Conference. \"When you think about moats, ... [they are in] markets where people are not really wanting to change things a lot.\"\n\nLooking ahead, AMD's newest data center chip, the MI300, could be the push it needs to narrow the gap on the competition.\nThe company is betting that a ramp-up of its MI300 chips will give it a piece of the lucrative data center business, as tech firms race to secure power to train their AI models. \"This growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history,\" Su said in a call with analysts.\nTD Cowen's Matthew Ramsay, writing on Oct. 16, noted that while this might be a \"choppy\" earnings season for AMD and competitors like Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL), these companies are set up for strong growth by the end of 2024 and into 2025.\n\"We continue to emphasize that the vast majority of these semis franchises ... are high-quality, high-margin businesses and long-term secular trends remain quite positive,\" he wrote.\nLast Friday, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest bought more than 50,000 shares of AMD, a purchase valued at more than $5 million.\nThe chipmaker's shares are up about 50% year to date.\nHere are the key numbers that AMD reported as compared to analysts' expectations compiled by Bloomberg:\nRevenue: $5.8 billion actual versus $5.7 billion expected\nAdjusted EPS: $0.70 actual versus $0.68 expected\nAdjusted operating margin: 22% actual versus 21.6% expected\nQ4 revenue outlook: ~$6.1 billion actual versus $6.4 billion expected\nCurrently, Wall Street analyst recommendations for AMD shake out to 39 Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell.\nAMD's gaming revenue came in at $1.5 billion, down 8% year over year and missing analysts' expectations of $1.53 billion. AMD's gaming chips are used in video game consoles like Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5.\nThe company's embedded segment revenue for Q3 was $1.2 billion, amid a still-sluggish PC market. The number marks a decline of 5% year over year and falls short of estimates of $1.31 billion.\nAMD will keep AI and data centers as its focus in 2024. \"We will definitely increase both R&D investment and the go-to-market investment to address those opportunities,\" Su told analysts. \"The way to think about it is that our objective is to drive top-line growth, much faster than OpEx growth, so our investment can drive long-term growth.\"\nAllie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\n(Corrects name of Preqin in paragraph 3)\nBy Hadeel Al Sayegh and Anousha Sakoui\nRIYADH/LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - A growing number of private equity funds are opening offices in the Gulf, hoping to deepen their ties with cash-rich sovereign wealth funds and families in the region as funding for buyouts has dried up elsewhere.\nWhile the Gulf had previously been a place where buyout groups would go to raise money to invest in other markets, increasingly they are looking to build teams on the ground, invest in local businesses and help develop the region's asset managers, private equity funds and advisers said.\nGlobal fundraising for alternative investments, which include private equity, dropped 21% to $972 billion in the year to Nov. 1 from the same period a year earlier, according to research firm Preqin. Rising interest rates have pushed up the return investors can make in rival assets classes such as bonds.\nAs their money becomes more vital, Gulf funds are encouraging private equity firms to invest locally in plans for a post-oil future. These include diversifying into other energy sources like hydrogen, building state companies into regional champions, attracting foreign investment, and creating jobs.\n\"Building a partnership based on reciprocity is nowadays necessary to succeed in the Gulf,\" said Francois Aissa-Touazi, co-global head of investor relations at private equity fund Ardian.\nArdian opened an office in Abu Dhabi in January and currently has a team of 12. \"The objective is to reach 25 people by end of next year. We will soon have a hydrogen investment team based in our office,\" Aissa-Touazi said.\nOn the sidelines of last week's Future Investment Initiative (FII) - dubbed Davos in the Desert - the deputy governor of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund emphasised the need for foreign investors to be based in Saudi Arabia if they want to raise money from the country's wealthy funds and families.\n\"(It will soon be a) prerequisite to have your people here in order to manage PIF money,\" said Yazeed A. al-Humied of the Public Investment Fund (PIF). \"We are saying this is an incentive. In the near future, we want to see the people here, on the ground. The market is here.\"\nPrivate equity funds are getting the message.\nCanadian asset manager Brookfield recently opened an office in Riyadh and plans to open another in Abu Dhabi, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Brookfield declined to comment.\nEuropean buyout groups Tikehau Capital and Ardian opened offices in Abu Dhabi this year, while CVC opened an office in Dubai last year.\nPARTNERSHIPS\nBruce Flatt, chief executive of Brookfield, was among the investors who thronged to Riyadh last week for the FII.\n\"We have $50 billion of businesses. We have just under $10 billion in this region. We're building out every one of those businesses in Saudi Arabia,\" Flatt said from the stage.\n\"We will be much, much bigger in the future,\" he added, without giving details.\nIn a separate development, Saudi Arabia will set a January 2024 deadline for foreign firms that want to secure government contracts to establish their regional headquarters to Riyadh, finance minister Mohammed Al Jadaan told Reuters last week.\n\"You will see private equity open offices in the region because they want to be close to limited partners for fundraising but also to partner with them on doing new deals,\" said Anthony Diamandakis, chief of Citi's alternatives business.\nMoreover, Saudi Arabia's privatisation efforts - from soccer clubs to flour mills - are unlocking prime assets previously inaccessible to foreign investors.\n\"Gulf governments and their associated sovereign wealth funds are wanting investors to come and invest alongside them into assets that serve both a strategic purpose for the region and also deliver a financial return,\" said Rishi Kapoor, co-CEO of Bahrain-based alternative asset manager Investcorp.\nThe bulk of the deals done so far have been in infrastructure, from oil and gas pipelines to real estate, but buyout firms are also looking at how to participate in the energy transition, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, as governments strive to meet net zero emission targets.\nAnother area of development is asset management, with funds helping local institutions to develop their skills. In turn private equity funds can use these pools of capital to fund large private debt or equity transactions, according to Tikehau Capital's Deputy CEO, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Giovansili.\n\"There is an alignment of interest, where they want to accelerate their asset management capabilities and we want to find a complementary pool of capital,\" he said.

Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a 4.1% increase.\nWith price gains abating across Europe and the region on the brink of a recession, money-market traders are now fully pricing a first cut in the ECB\u2019s deposit rate for April \u2014 sooner than officials in Frankfurt have been suggesting.\nThe GDP revision points to weaker growth across the euro region than officials were aware of. Both of its biggest economies have now suffered a contraction and Germany is predicted by the Bundesbank to be in a recession.\nMeanwhile, the retreat in inflation following its biggest spike of the euro era backs the ECB\u2019s decision to stop raising rates last month. Despite market wagers, though, officials caution that they\u2019re in no hurry to begin cutting.\nInflation in France has eased more slowly than elsewhere in Europe as the government partially lifted caps on electricity costs. Other components of the basket have kept tracking downward, however. In November, services inflation slowed to 2.7% from 3.2% in October and manufactured goods price increases declined to 1.9% from 2.2%.\nThe headline number could jump to 4.5% in December, according to Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Nowcast.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\u201cThe larger-than-expected decline in French inflation points to a rapid fall in underlying price pressures.

        "text": "\n(Adds details, inflation expectations, analyst comments throughout)\n*\nWeekly jobless claims drop 24,000 to 209,000\n*\nContinuing claims decline 22,000 to 1.840 million\n*\nCore capital goods orders dip 0.1%; shipments unchanged\nBy Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, but that likely does not change the view that the labor market is gradually slowing as higher interest rates cool demand in the economy.\nThough the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed unemployment rolls declining for the first-time since mid-September, they remained near the highs for this year. The drop in both initial and continuing claims likely reflected ongoing challenges ironing out seasonal fluctuations from the data.\nSlowing demand for labor and subsiding inflation have led economists and financial markets to conclude the Federal Reserve was done hiking interest rates in the current cycle.\n\"Looking past seasonal noise, we think the claims data are consistent with a job market that is cooling enough to keep rate hikes off the table, but too strong to make rate cuts a consideration any time soon,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 24,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended Nov. 18. The decline more than reversed the jump in the prior week, which had lifted claims to a three-month high. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 226,000 claims for the latest week.\nThe data was released a day early because of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.\nUnadjusted claims rose 21,239 to 238,677 last week. Claims in California surged 7,911. There were also significant increases in filings in Kentucky, Oregon, Kentucky and Illinois. Only Texas reported a decrease in claims in excess of 1,000.\nMinutes of the Fed's Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting published on Tuesday showed that while policymakers viewed labor market conditions as having \"remained tight,\" they noted that \"they had eased since earlier in the year, partly as a result of recent increases in labor supply.\"\nStocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices of shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.\nLABOR MARKET SLOWING\nFinancial markets are anticipating a rate cut in the middle of 2024, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. Most economists, however, view a rate cut as premature.\nIndeed, a survey from the University of Michigan on Wednesday showed consumers this month anticipating higher inflation both in the near and long term. The rise in inflation expectations, especially over the next five years to the highest level since 2011, could worry policymakers. Since March 2022, the U.S. central bank has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range.\n\"This will remind policymakers that it will be some time before the Fed can consider the 2021-22 surge in inflation to have truly been contained and reversed,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.\nBut other economists were not too concerned, with Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan, arguing that \"we should also keep in mind that this increase in inflation expectations has not been evident to the same degree in some other related measures.\"\nA survey from the New York Fed this month showed softer inflation expectations in October.\nThe claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report.\nClaims rose marginally between the October and November survey weeks. The economy created 150,000 jobs in October.\nThough the labor market is steadily slowing, there are signs the moderation is broadening out. According to the Bank of America Institute, an analysis of internal data showed a rise in \"pay disruptions\" over 2023, consistent with rising joblessness.\nIt noted that this phenomenon, previously confined to higher-income groups, appeared to be extending to middle- and lower-income cohorts. The institute also said there was a significant slowdown in job-to-job moves, consistent with slower hiring and workers' reluctance to move against an uncertain economic backdrop.\nData next week on the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, will offer more clues on the health of the labor market in November. Continuing claims fell 22,000 to 1.840 million during the week ending Nov. 11, the latest claims report showed. They had increased since mid-September, hitting a two-year high in early November.\nMost economists expect them to resume their upward trend in the coming weeks. A combination of easing labor market conditions and difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations following an unprecedented surge in applications for jobless benefits early in the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed continuing claims higher.\nSlowing economic demand was evident in a report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing business spending on equipment struggling to rebound early in the fourth quarter. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dipped 0.1% last month after falling 0.2% in September, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said.\nCore capital goods shipments were unchanged for a second straight month. Shipments of non-defense capital goods dropped 0.3% following a 0.2% decline in the prior month.\nThese shipments feed into the calculation of equipment spending in the gross domestic product report. Business spending on equipment contracted in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 4.9% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 2% pace.\n\"It's true that the recent drop-back in bond yields may provide some support for investment, but borrowing costs are likely to remain considerably higher than they were a couple of years ago for the foreseeable future,\" said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. \"And with banks continuing to tighten lending standards too, there appears to be little chance of an imminent recovery.\"\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Paul Simao)",

Even Germany, which has fared worse than peers amid a prolonged manufacturing slump, is predicted to avoid a recession.\nFor the full year, the EU\u2019s executive arm now sees 0.6% growth, down from a September forecast of 0.8%. That\u2019s seen picking up to 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025 \u2014 a slightly more optimistic view than that of the European Central Bank.\n\u201cStrong price pressures and the monetary tightening needed to contain them, as well as weak global demand, have taken their toll on households and businesses,\u201d EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said in a statement. \u201cLooking ahead to 2024, we expect a modest uptick in growth as inflation eases further and the labor market remains resilient.\u201d\nPrice growth will average 5.6% this year and ease to 3.2% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. That\u2019s similar to the ECB\u2019s prediction and an upward revision for next year compared to the EU\u2019s September forecast, prompted by higher energy and food commodity costs.\n\u201cStill, price pressures related to non-energy consumption categories are expected to unwind, broadly in line with the previous forecast and in a context of slightly tighter financing conditions, moderating wage growth and normalizing profit shares,\u201d the commission said.\nInflation eased to 2.9% last month, down from a peak of more than 10%, but ECB policymakers have warned against complacency as price growth may pick up again in coming months. They kept interest rates on hold in October, saying the current level will help return inflation to the 2% goal \u2014 if held for long enough.\nHigh living costs and the ECB\u2019s unprecedented tightening campaign that started in mid-2022 \u201ctook a heavier toll than previously expected,\u201d the commission said.\nSpeaking Wednesday to Bloomberg TV, ECB Governing Council member Mario Centeno acknowledged worries over the lack of momentum in the euro-area economy.\n\u201cThe numbers have not been great, zero, 0.1, -0.1 quarter-on quarter for five quarters in a row creates a little bit of anxiety over will this be a soft landing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis stagnation of the euro area is of course a source of concern for all.\u201d\nEU officials also warned of stalling efforts to bring down public debt in some of the bloc\u2019s biggest economies. Italy\u2019s is seen increasing back above 140% of output in the next two years, with an uptick in 2025 also seen in France after a slight dip in the preceding year.\nInitially helped by inflation, debt reduction is set to become tougher as price growth slows, borrowing costs rise and growth remains subdued, the commission said.\nThe euro area\u2019s sovereign debt has become an increasing source of unease after governments borrowed heavily during the pandemic and the energy crisis while borrowing costs jumped to combat inflation.\nThe labor market has been a bright spot so far, with unemployment barely increasing even as the economy struggled. While some member states have meanwhile seen an uptick, jobless rates \u201care expected to remain broadly stable,\u201d the commission said.\nThe continued war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East mean uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, it added. How China fares and the transmission of monetary tightening within the euro area also pose risks.\nThe report covered Ukraine itself for the first time after the country gained EU candidate status.

        "text": "\nBy Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The Japanese yen climbed to a two-week peak against the dollar on Monday after a report said the Bank of Japan is considering tweaking its yield curve control policy to allow the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to rise above 1% when it concludes its meeting on Tuesday.\nThe Nikkei report pushed the yen to 148.81 per dollar, its strongest level since Oct. 17. The greenback, which has been on the defensive all day, was last down 0.4% at 149.065 yen.\nSurging global rates have heightened pressure on the BOJ, which kicked off its two-day monetary policy meeting on Monday, to change its bond yield control policy, in which it maintains a -0.1% short-term interest rate target and a 0% cap on the 10-year bond yield.\n\"If the BOJ does not do anything tomorrow, which I think that's what economists expect, and just wait until December, I think the dollar jumps right back versus the yen,\" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.\nBut with Monday's action, Chandler thinks Japanese intervention seems unlikely, although he noted that in the last few weeks the BOJ has intervened in the bond market as an alternative.\n\"The key to intervention is excessive volatility and the BOJ has been saying this: that it's not targeting a particular level. So that's taking the magic away from the 150 mark,\" he said.\nAside from the BOJ, market participants are looking ahead to interest rate decisions from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England (BoE).\nA slew of purchasing managers' surveys, euro zone inflation and GDP data, and U.S. nonfarm payrolls are also due for release this week.\n\"If consumer data domestically hadn't been so strong last week, we'd probably be looking at a bigger slide for the dollar, but markets are still finding it quite difficult to discount the resilience of the U.S. economy,\" said Helen Given, FX trader at Monex USA in Washington.\nAnalysts also pointed to the U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding announcement on Wednesday that could move both the bond and currency markets.\nThat comes as mounting deficits and a heavier interest rate burden have substantially increased the U.S. Treasury's funding needs. Since the last announcement in August, borrowing rates have spiraled to their highest since 2006-07.\nThe dollar index was last down 0.4% at 106.11, after earlier falling to a one-week low of 106.06, hurt by a pickup in the euro. The euro was last up 0.5% at $1.0615.\nThe U.S. Treasury on Monday announced borrowing estimates of $776 billion for the fourth quarter, lower than the $852 billion forecast announced on July 31, due to expectations of higher receipts.\nThe greenback slightly extended losses after the announcement.\nLater this week, the Fed and BoE are both expected to keep rates steady so, barring any surprises, the focus will be on the message from policymakers.\nThe pound was up 0.4% at $1.2164.\nU.S. nonfarm payrolls data on Friday will also be important for expectations of the Fed's rate hike path.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Older, shorter, female or even foreign \u2014 US allies in Asia are looking beyond their traditional military recruitment profile to secure enough troops and handle the growing security challenges posed by China and North Korea.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBiden, Xi to Announce China\u2019s Crackdown on Fentanyl Trade\nWall Street Divided Over Just How Aggressive Fed Cutting Will Be\nUBS Strategists See Far Deeper Fed Rate Cuts Than What Markets Are Pricing\nThailand Takes $28 Billion Malacca Strait Bypass Plan to US\nIsrael Latest: Biden Urges \u2018Less Intrusive Action\u2019 as Troops Close in on Gaza Hospital\nJapan and the Philippines each have simmering territorial disputes with China, while a wider swath of countries including Australia and South Korea shares concerns about the economic devastation that could be wrought if they lose access to key sea lanes.\nFor all of them, Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has served as a reminder that an alliance with the US may not be enough to thwart possible attacks. In particular, it\u2019s highlighted the sheer number of boots on the ground, not just equipment, needed in the event of such aggression. Yet some Asian countries, most notably Japan, face a shrinking pool of young recruits even as they fret over a possible contingency involving the huge armies boasted by some of their neighbors.\nTaiwan is throwing its net wider for compulsory military service. From May it included men as short as 155 cm (5 feet) compared with a previous 157 cm minimum, while those with a body mass index as low as 15 or as high as 35 now qualify. Next year, it will extend the length of service to a year from the current four months.\nIn South Korea, which is struggling with the world\u2019s lowest birthrate, there\u2019s been talk of whether to conscript women as well as men. Officials deny such a plan, though it would potentially double its pool of recruits. Australia allows experienced foreign soldiers to join its armed forces.\nJapan has neither mandatory service nor a flow of willing immigrants to count on. Its military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, has seen applications fall.\nThe number of Japanese people between the ages of 18 and 26, the main source of recruits for the SDF\u2019s lower ranks, has shrunk to around 10 million from 17 million three decades ago and is seen falling further in coming years. The SDF raised the maximum age for new recruits to 32 from 26 in 2018 but has still struggled to attract them.\n\u201cThis is a big structural problem,\u201d said Christopher Johnstone, a former director for East Asia at the US National Security Council, who is now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cIt will challenge in a significant way Japan\u2019s ability to do all the things that it says it wants to do in its national defense strategy.\u201d\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has repeatedly warned of the growing possibility of conflict in Asia. Spooked by Chinese missiles landing in what it deems its exclusive economic zone close to Taiwan, Japan last year dubbed its neighbor an \u201cunprecedented strategic challenge\u201d and pledged its biggest defense build-up since World War II. But a Defense Ministry advisory panel warned in a report in July that however much larger or more advanced its arsenal becomes, Japan will still need people to operate it.\n\u201cThe war in Ukraine was a wake-up call both for the general public and for military planners,\u201d said Andrew Oros, a politics professor at Washington College, who is researching a book on how the region\u2019s graying populations affect their security. \u201cTechnology alone is not a solution to a shrinking standing military force.\u201d\nNot only are the numbers of young Japanese tumbling, but an ever-higher proportion are opting to attend university, meaning far fewer are willing to join the SDF after high school.\n\u201cIf you join the private economy, you have more freedoms, your life is less at risk,\u201d said Tom Le, author of Japan\u2019s Aging Peace, and associate professor of politics at Pomona College in California. \u201cSony and Mitsubishi will also want that same labor.\u201d\nAt an August introductory event for the SDF at Camp Nerima, a base in suburban Tokyo, cosmetics company employee Ryohei Kuroda said he\u2019d long been interested in joining the armed forces.\n\u201cI had thought I wasn\u2019t cut out for it and half given up,\u201d he said, adding that he wasn\u2019t put off by North Korean missiles or the Ukraine conflict and that the day-long event convinced him to apply. \u201cI want to do something that makes people grateful.\u201d\nAt the other end of the demographic spectrum, more members are being re-hired after retirement, a milestone that varies by rank. Many take on desk jobs, like Yasuhiro Matsuzaki, who switched to recruiting from teaching martial arts after reaching the official retirement age of 55 last year. Even in the Maritime Self-Defense Force, known for its physically demanding duties, more positions are being opened up to retirees. The maximum age for reserves for the lower ranks was raised to 54 in 2018 from the previous 36.\nYet another problem is image. Joining the SDF is seen as neither prestigious nor financially rewarding. While it is admired for its rescue work, those drawn to such efforts may find it easier to join the fire service, given the aversion to the military that has lingered since World War II. A 2015 survey by Gallup International found the Japanese were the least willing to fight for their country among the nationalities surveyed, with only 11% saying they would do so, compared with 42% in South Korea and 71% in China.\nEven in Taiwan, an obvious potential flashpoint for the region, there\u2019s little enthusiasm for taking part.\n\u201cYoung Taiwanese people don\u2019t like to serve in the military as they think it\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d said Lu Li-shih, a former instructor at the Taiwanese Naval Academy.\nSome governments are trying to improve the military\u2019s appeal by bolstering pay and other conditions. Australia this year announced an AU $50,000 ($31,800) bonus for those who commit to stay on for three years beyond an initial period of service.\n\u201cThere\u2019s competition for a very limited set of skills and potential recruits,\u201d said Euan Graham, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Finding and retaining crew for the country\u2019s planned fleet of nuclear submarines will be \u201cparticularly challenging,\u201d he added.\nJapan\u2019s latest recruitment brochure emphasizes long holidays, work-life balance and even jobs for people who aren\u2019t confident they have the physical stamina for the armed forces. The defense ministry has sought to upgrade housing offered to SDF members and its budget request for next year includes items like cash to improve internet access on ships and submarines, alleviating isolation for the sailors.\nThe SDF is also hoping to attract more women, although this may prove difficult given its reputation for harassment. A probe prompted by a high-profile sexual assault allegation uncovered 1,325 cases of harassment, according to a report published in August.\nMajor Fumitoshi Sato, a 62-year-old working for the ground forces as an auditor at headquarters in Tokyo, said conditions had improved since he joined in 1985. In an interview, he described past working conditions as exploitative.\n\u201cThere used to be a lot of power harassment and sexual harassment,\u201d said Sato, who was rehired after his official retirement and plans to stay on to age 65. \u201cNow they are really trying to create an atmosphere where that\u2019s unacceptable. I think it\u2019s a good policy.\u201d\nIn a potential longer-term strategy, Japan could shift the weighting of its forces from ground troops toward the maritime and air arenas where it faces more immediate threats, according to Johnstone. Even as Chinese vessels are an almost constant presence around disputed islands in the East China Sea, ground forces make up more than 60% of the total of about 230,000 SDF personnel. A shift, however, would take time.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take a soldier and tomorrow say they are a sailor,\u201d Johnstone said.\nUltimately, deterring China by presenting a united front with the US and other regional partners should be prioritized over planning how to fight, according to Toshiyuki Ito, a retired vice-admiral who\u2019s now a professor at Kanazawa Institute of Technology.\n\u201cTalking about numbers of personnel and what happens if a war breaks out is important, but we need to figure out how to prevent a war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make them realize that if they do something, not just the US, but Japan, South Korea and Australia will fight together and crush them.\u201d\n--With assistance from Yuki Hagiwara, Cindy Wang, Ben Westcott and Philip Heijmans.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

It did not elaborate. Optus has previously ruled out a cyber attack.\nCustomers will be given free data \"to acknowledge their patience and loyalty\" CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said in a statement.\nHours earlier, the government announced a post-incident review into the outage that hit payments, transport and hospitals and about 40% of the population. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland describing the incident as \"particularly concerning\".\n\"While we welcome that Optus services were restored over the course of the day, it is critical the government conducts a process to identify lessons to be learned from yesterday's outage,\" Rowland said in a statement.\nAustralia's media regulator will conduct a separate review into the outage after emergency triple zero (\"000\") calls went down on Optus landlines, Rowland added.\nTaxi driver Ian Martin-Brown told Nine Network that he might take legal action after losing a day's work. Other customers including cafe owners and niche online retailers told media outlets they would seek compensation for lost revenue.\n\"There's no doubt that it has to be on the table,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones told ABC Radio. \"If you're a small business that's lost a day's takings because your phone system wasn't working then you're going to be asking those hard questions.\"\nParent company Singtel said the outage had \"let down our customers\" and apologised as it reported on Thursday an 83% jump in half-yearly profit.\nBut UBS analysts said Optus now faces the possibility of losing customers to Telstra, the nation's largest telco firm, and TPG Telecom due to \"strong brand perceptions\" of the network quality of rivals.\nThe government said it would also check the possibility of allowing customers to switch to available networks when future outages occur.\n\"The industry is prepared to be involved ... it is feasible and we're going to take this forward as a government,\" Rowland told the ABC.\n(Reporting by Renju Jose in Sydney; Editing by Jamie Freed and Miral Fahmy)",

        "text": "\nWith the 2024 US presidential election just under a year away, AI experts are sounding a warning about the potential for a massive upswing in disinformation and misinformation campaigns using newly available generative AI technologies.\n\u201cThere's going to be a tsunami of disinformation in the upcoming election,\u201d Darrell West, senior fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u201cBasically, anybody can use AI to create fake videos and audio tapes. And it's going to be almost impossible to distinguish the real from the fake,\u201d he said.\nGenerative AI technologies exploded in popularity with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Since then, major tech companies including Microsoft (MSFT), which invested billions in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Adobe (ADBE) have debuted or announced they\u2019re working on their own AI platforms.\nAnd while those companies have strict rules around how you can use their generative AI apps, experts fear that other forms of generative AI services designed to create text, images, and video could give malicious actors or state-sponsored entities an easy means to sow discord among potential voters. And it could put off some Americans from trusting news sources entirely.\nWhat\u2019s more, it will put more pressure on social media companies to take the kind of stand against disinformation they held around the 2020 election, when they worked to remove fake content related to the attack on the Capitol and outcome of the election itself.\n\u201cIt absolutely is going to be wild,\u201d said Jen Golbeck, a professor of information studies at the University of Maryland. \u201cThey're going to see this glut of shared-in-bad-faith content from people on social media and just kind of throw their hands up and be like, \u2018It's all a mess. I don't even know.\u2019 And then entirely disengage from the really important issues that are going on.\u201d\nDisinformation and misinformation aren't new. There\u2019s so much online already that double-checking anything you see on social media, or that weird Uncle Bill tells you, is a must. But generative AI will allow bad actors to create new phony content at a much faster pace than before.\nThe idea of generative AI being used in a political context isn\u2019t some unfounded fear or far-off eventuality. It\u2019s happening already. In the days leading up to former President Trump being arrested in New York in April, a slew of images depicting him running from police and being gang tackled splashed across social media sites around the world.\nThen in May, an image of an explosion outside of the Pentagon sent a shock through the stock market before it was determined to be a fake and likely generated using AI. Generative AI images and video have also been used to manipulate public opinion in both the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\u201cThere has been a lot in the past few weeks of disinformation spread on social media about the conflict happening in Palestine and that is something that I think can be completely accelerated by AI generated text and images,\u201d Derek Leben, associate teaching professor of ethics at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u201cSo yes, I think that it is justified to be very concerned about this. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of easy solutions to this problem. Even if the platforms are trying to crack down on it, even if the regulators are trying to crack down on it, it is by its very nature very difficult to detect and therefore very difficult to enforce any kind of restrictions on,\u201d Leben added.\nConfident that this picture claiming to show an \"explosion near the pentagon\" is AI generated.\n\nCheck out the frontage of the building, and the way the fence melds into the crowd barriers. There's also no other images, videos or people posting as first hand witnesses. pic.twitter.com/t1YKQabuNL\n\u2014 Nick Waters (@N_Waters89) May 22, 2023\nSome political campaigns have already begun using AI too. According to ABC News, a super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis released an ad using generative AI to make it appear as though former President Trump was reading posts he wrote on social media.\nWhile it might seem easy to know when an image or video is fake or not, the sheer amount of disinformation online can, over time, erode trust in legitimate sources of information, especially among voters who aren\u2019t partisan or constantly glued to their preferred news sites.\n\u201cThe really concerning part for me is this middle space of people who aren't super news wonks, that aren't deeply invested in politics, that just want to get their information in an easy way, and are on social media and are seeing all of this stuff, some of which they'll go like, \u2018Well, that's obviously fake.\u2019 Or, \u2018Man, I read that article, and it just sounds kind of crazy and it doesn't make any sense,\u2019 \u201d Golbeck explained.\nTry using the generative AI platform DALL-E to create a generative AI image of Biden or Trump, and you\u2019ll get a notification telling you the app can\u2019t make such items. You\u2019ll get the same response from Adobe\u2019s Firefly and other mainstream generative AI platforms. As companies roll out new technologies, they\u2019re increasingly putting up roadblocks to keep users from generating potentially dangerous content.\nBut there are plenty of services on the internet that will let you make those images. And once they\u2019re online, they're there forever.\nThat\u2019s where social media companies come in. If there\u2019s any way to help keep generative AI-based disinformation and misinformation offline, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) will need to take steps to keep users from spreading such content.\nMeta, so far, has said that advertisers will need to disclose when they use generative AI to manipulate political ads. The company has also entirely banned advertisers from manipulating ads using Meta\u2019s generative AI tech.\nBut the company and rival X have also cut back on their election integrity teams, the groups meant to help counter disinformation.\n\u201cThey should take content moderation very seriously and take down content that is seriously inaccurate,\u201d West said.\n\u201cThe problem is that in the last year or so, the tech companies have moved in the opposite direction. The guardrails that actually worked \u2026 over the last few years are being dismantled and that exposes the public to tremendous risk,\u201d he added.\nHow they\u2019ll address the risk of generative AI to the 2024 election could be just as impactful as the work the platforms did in tamping down election denial and anti-COVID content. Regardless of what the companies do, the election is coming, and so is the disinformation.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "text": "\nImportant people love to have things named after themselves: art museums, libraries, automobiles, even healthcare policies. Just don\u2019t put their name on something people dislike.\nPresident Joe Biden decided earlier this year to claim ownership of \u201cBidenomics,\u201d the shorthand term Yahoo Finance and other news outlets use to describe Biden\u2019s economic policies. At first he said of Bidenomics, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell it is.\u201d But then, in June, Biden said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, because it is my policy.\u201d For the next several months, Biden declared over and over in speeches on the economy, \u201cBidenomics is working.\u201d\nBut now \u201cBidenomics\u201d is on hiatus. NBC News recently reported that the term hasn\u2019t shown up in a Biden speech since Nov. 1, even though Biden continues to travel the country touting his economic successes. The White House still uses the term to frame Biden\u2019s economic plan, but Biden himself has stopped saying it. So maybe it will return to Biden\u2019s vocabulary. Or maybe it\u2019s gone forever.\nIt\u2019s no secret why Biden\u2019s team might be torn about \u201cBidenomics\u201d \u2014 the public thinks it\u2019s a failure. Back in June, Biden had good reason to think the nation\u2019s sour outlook on the economy was likely to improve. Inflation was coming down quickly, while the job market remained strong. As price hikes dissipated, paychecks would go further and people would feel better.\nThose trends have continued, with the annualized inflation rate dropping from a peak of 9% last year to just 3.2%, which is nearly out of the danger zone. Real income, adjusted for inflation, went from negative to positive over the summer. Families who were losing ground to inflation started regaining it.\nBut Biden\u2019s weak approval rating hasn\u2019t budged. It sank as inflation was rising, but never rose as inflation was falling. It\u2019s now at around 38%, same as at the nadir of 2022, when inflation peaked. Voters soured on Biden as inflation was wrecking their budgets, but they haven\u2019t forgiven him now that inflation is on the wane.\nSo Biden seems to have an intractable problem as he campaigns for another four years in office. It\u2019s hard to imagine that banishing a single term, \u201cBidenomics,\u201d will make any difference to voters fed up with price shocks. But the verbal dilemma reflects the much bigger political problem of how to convince voters with a recessionary mindset that things aren\u2019t all that bad.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nAs Biden continually points out, job growth during his term has been the strongest under any president, ever, and the economy just turned in banner GDP growth of 5.2% in the third quarter. Gas prices have fallen into a range that\u2019s arguably normal and every prediction of a recession during Biden's presidency has turned out to be flat wrong.\nAll of it to no effect. The most alarming sign to Democrats isn\u2019t Biden\u2019s sagging approval rating, but polls that show him losing to former President Donald Trump in swing states likely to determine the winner of next year\u2019s election. It seems impossible: Trump comes off as increasingly unhinged, he\u2019s facing 91 criminal charges in four different cases, and he trails railcars of baggage from the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol. Yet he's polling ahead of a president who can boast about a 3.9% unemployment rate.\nSo some Democrats think Biden should just stop talking about the economy. As the New Yorker recently pointed out, some strategists think Biden should tone down his economic cheerleading, even though there really is a factory boom, a potent green energy transition, new momentum for labor unions, and rapidly improving inflation.\nInstead: Highlight everything bad about Trump, including radical new ideas such as adding a new tax on all imports, firing much of the federal bureaucracy, repealing the Affordable Care Act (again), and pardoning himself. If you can\u2019t persuade people they\u2019d be better off under Biden, then try convincing them they\u2019d be worse off under Trump.\nIt\u2019s possible and even likely, of course, that inflation will fall even further and the psychic scarring of the last three years will wear off by Election Day 2024. But many thought that would have happened by now. The specter of inflation casts a long and scary shadow, it turns out, and when people hear \u201cBidenomics,\u201d they seem to conjure $5 gas and a $16 hamburger. So best to dissociate the incumbent from that, with less than 12 months to rehabilitate the name not spoken.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Meanwhile, government deficits and debt have declined after a burst of stimulus spending during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGentiloni said at a news conference in Brussels that \u201cgrowth momentum in the EU remains very weak.\u201d Hopes for a recovery are being sustained by investment and spending from the EU's pandemic recovery fund, and from a strong labor market, which provided \u201cthe main underlying force behind the outlook\u201d for growth, he said.\n\"Importantly, this forecast foresees wage growth exceeding inflation, finally allowing workers to at least partially recovery purchasing power, Gentiloni said.\nThe economy has barely grown this year, recording zero increase in the first quarter, 0.2% growth in the third, and a fall of 0.1% in output in the third quarter.\nInflation declined to 2.9% in October from its peak of 10.6% a year earlier as the European Central Bank swiftly raised its key interest rate benchmark from minus 0.5% to 4% in just over a year. Higher interest rates are the typical central bank tool against inflation. But they can also weigh on growth by making credit more expensive for consumer purchases or for business investment in new offices or production facilities.",

He began assembling the team for 01.AI in March and started operations in June.\nThe Beijing startup\u2019s open-sourced, foundational large language model, Yi-34B, is now available to developers around the world in Chinese and English. Large language models, or LLMs, are computer algorithms trained on large quantities of data to read, understand and produce human-like text, images and code.\nOn key metrics, Yi-34B outperforms leading open-source models already on the market, including Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s well-regarded Llama 2. Hugging Face, which runs leaderboards for the best-performing LLMs in various categories, posted evaluations over the weekend ranking the Chinese model first for what\u2019s known as pre-trained base LLMs.\n\u201cLlama 2 has been the gold standard and a big contribution to the open-source community,\u201d Lee, 61, said in an interview over Zoom. \u201cWe want to provide a superior alternative not just for China but for the global market.\u201d\nSan Francisco-based OpenAI set off a frenzy of interest in AI after it unveiled its ChatGPT chatbot last year. Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta have poured billions into research and development, seeking leadership in the emergent field of generative AI and beyond. Elon Musk just unveiled a chatbot called Grok.\nIn China, tech giants and entrepreneurs have also jumped into the field, with search leader Baidu Inc. showcasing a version of its Ernie LLM it claimed was on par with OpenAI\u2019s technology. Alibaba has backed at least three ventures in the space, including 01.AI. The two countries\u2019 AI companies largely don\u2019t compete with each other because American technologies aren\u2019t available in China.\nStill, growing political tensions between the US and China have complicated the development of AI. US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration banned the sale of Nvidia Corp.\u2019s most advanced AI semiconductors to Chinese customers last year, citing national security concerns that the technology could be used to train AI models for military applications. Last month, the US tightened those constraints even further, barring Nvidia from selling slightly less advanced chips it had designed specifically for China.\nLee called the situation \u201cregrettable\u201d but said 01.AI stockpiled the chips it needs for the foreseeable future. The startup began amassing the semiconductors earlier this year, going as far as borrowing money from Sinovation Ventures for the purchases.\n\u201cWe basically bet the farm and overspent our original bank account,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt we had to do this.\u201d\nLee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple Inc. before moving into venture capital, has built a team of more than 100 people at 01.AI, drawing former colleagues from the US companies and Chinese nationals who have been working overseas. The group includes not just AI specialists, he said, but experienced business people who can help with everything from mergers and acquisitions to an initial public offering.\n01.AI is already plotting its business strategy beyond the open-source model just introduced. The startup will work with customers on proprietary alternatives, tailored for a particular industry or competitive situation. For example, Yi-34B gets its name from the 34 billion parameters used in training, but the startup is already working on a 100-billion-plus parameter model.\n\u201cOur proprietary model will be benchmarked with GPT-4,\u201d said Lee, referring to OpenAI\u2019s LLM.\nOffering a system in English and Chinese will be an advantage for global companies like banks, insurers and trading companies, he said. The startup plans to add more languages in the future.\nRead more: Billionaires and Bureaucrats Mobilize China for AI Race With US\nLee\u2019s work on AI dates back decades. In his 1982 application to graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University, he wrote that he wanted to devote his life to AI research because the technology would help humans understand themselves better. He went on to write two best-selling books, \u201cAI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order\u201d and \u201cAI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest breakthrough for humanity,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s also the final step to understanding ourselves.\u201d\nHe said he frequently wondered whether the technology\u2019s promise would be realized during his lifetime \u2014 until he saw the power of the latest generation of LLMs. He decided to depart from his usual role as venture capitalist and become a startup CEO because of the promise of the technology and the opportunity to connect the dots from his roles as computer scientist, author and executive.\n01.AI opted to build an open-source model because the vast majority of AI developers cannot afford or don\u2019t need the largest, most expensive models. Open source AI systems are like open source software, where the source code can be modified and enhanced.\nThe size of the just-launched AI system, 34 billion parameters, was carefully chosen so that it can run on computers that aren\u2019t prohibitively expensive. The company is also releasing a 6B model to appeal to a broader swath of developers. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly calculated decision,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t need another arbitrary model, the world needs us.\u201d\nLee said he has gotten some questions from his venture firm\u2019s limited partners about how he will balance his dual CEO roles. He points out that if he spends 40 hours a week on Sinovation, there\u2019s another 128 hours weekly. \u201cI have 86 more hours to work on 01.AI without neglecting my Sinovation duties,\u201d he said, suggesting he may allocate six hours a day to sleep and everything else in his life.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery\nIn Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime\nCan a Triangle-Shaped Jet Cut Fuel Consumption in Half?\nPrivate Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

It hits a range of industries every year, from schools and hospitals to critical infrastructure departments and the government. Analysts say ransomware attackers also increasingly steal sensitive data to extort victims.\nThe White House has long advised against paying ransoms and has been pushing other countries to make the same commitment.\nDuring the third International Counter Ransomware Initiative, the administration will announce \u201csignificant\u201d outcomes, including initiatives for sharing information on the ransomware attackers between counties.\n\u201cWe're committing to sharing bad wallets - wallets that are used to move illicit ransom funds - as well as a number of other related projects,\u201d the official said.\nFiguring out the scale of ransomware attacks can be tricky because many companies don\u2019t report them. According to the data platform Statista, globally organizations detected 493.33 million ransomware attack attempts last year.\nThe criminals behind these hacks often used data from victims in one country to wage attacks on organizations in another country, which makes alliance across countries essential in fighting them, the official said.\nA U.S.-led alliance aimed at tackling these threats now includes 50 countries \u2013 from Nigeria and Costa Rice to Singapore and South Korea \u2013 said the official, adding that the Interpol and the European Union were also part of it.\nThat geographical breath reflects the U.S. government belief that \u201cwe have to work to ensure that all the digital connectivity we rely on for our citizens is secure,\u201d said the official.

A spokeswoman declined to elaborate on exactly how many were affected.\n\"We\u2019re shifting some of our efforts to better align with our business priorities, and what we know matters most to customers - which includes maximizing our resources and efforts focused on generative AI,\" Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Fire TV, said in the email. \"These shifts are leading us to discontinue some initiatives.\"\nAmazon has been pulling back in a variety of divisions this month, including in its music and gaming divisions and some human resources roles.\nWhile most of the jobs affected were in the devices division, a few were working on Alexa-related products in a different unit, a spokeswoman said. Many companies are shifting resources to generative AI, which can create software code and lengthy text responses from short prompts.\nAlexa is a voice assistant that can be used to set timers, ask search queries, play music, or as a home automation hub.\nReuters reported in September that morale in the devices division had suffered over concerns about what some viewed as a weak product pipeline. In particular, people familiar with the matter pointed to the Alexa voice assistant, now nearly a decade old, as having failed to keep pace in the age of generative artificial intelligence.\nAmazon said at the time that \"to suggest that a few anecdotes paint a picture of reality for an organization as large and diverse as Devices and Services is inaccurate,\" and that it stood by its products.\nAmazon has said its devices and services business is not profitable, without providing figures.\nOnly last month the device unit got a new chief, Panos Panay, who joined the company from Microsoft, replacing David Limp, a 13-year veteran who is leaving later this year to head Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin rocket company. Panay had overseen development of the Surface tablet.\nAmazon has struggled to generate any profits from Alexa, which many people use through Echo speakers or video screens. Most efforts to make money from it have centered on easing purchasing from Amazon.com.\nThe Seattle-based online retailer's voice assistant products compete with offerings from Alphabet and Apple.\nAmazon has cut more than 27,000 jobs across the company over the past year, part of a wave of U.S. tech layoffs after the industry hired heavily people during the pandemic.\nThe latest cuts come even as Amazon reported third-quarter net income that far exceeded analyst estimates and forecast revenue in the year\u2019s final quarter roughly in line with expectations. The fourth quarter is Amazon\u2019s most crucial, as it includes holiday shopping.\nIn the email, Rausch said he remained optimistic about Alexa.\n\"Incorporating a new large language model into a voice-forward, personal AI, has been and continues to be an enormous scientific and engineering challenge,\" he wrote, using another term for generative AI.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger in San Francisco; editing by Kenneth Li, Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis)",

Those funds had been factored into estimates for a primary budget deficit below 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2023.\nSince Lula, a leftist, said the government did not need to eliminate its primary budget deficit in 2024 as outlined under new fiscal rules, there has been growing speculation among that next year's fiscal target may be revised, a matter Haddad has avoided addressing directly.\nHaddad said the country's corporate income tax collection has been impacted by a \"monumental offset\" of tax credits following a 2021 Supreme Federal Court decision that excluded a state tax from the base calculation of federal taxes.\nThe effects of this decision retroactively go back to 2017, creating room for extensive tax credit claims by companies.\nHaddad said the government is now considering how to handle this situation, given the adverse and unpredictable impact of widespread tax credit utilization on tax revenues.\n\"That is the current topic of discussion, nothing else. We are engaged in technical work,\" he said. \"We are dealing with a significant sum that impacts the recently approved fiscal framework.\"\nThe minister also said the government needed to pass a measure to ensure that state-level tax incentives should not indiscriminately reduce companies' taxable income for federal revenue purposes.\nHaddad also said there is room for more interest rate cuts by Brazil's central bank, which has delivered three consecutive 50-basis-point reductions that have pushed its key Selic rate to 12.25%.\nHe also said he supported the Senate's ongoing analysis of a broad tax reform affecting consumption taxes, considering it a measure that will enhance the country's productivity.

Expressing one's thoughts freely could be met with imprisonment in North Korea.\nThe scripts totalling 30 pages, were unearthed by researchers at Palo Alto Networks, a U.S. cybersecurity firm which discovered a cache of internal documents online that detail the workings of North Korea's remote IT workforce.\nThe documents contain dozens of fraudulent resumes, online profiles, interview notes, and forged identities that North Korean workers used to apply for jobs in software development.\nReuters found further evidence in leaked darkweb data that revealed some of the tools and techniques used by North Korean workers to convince firms to employ them in jobs as far afield as Chile, New Zealand, the United States, Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates.\nThe documents and data reveal the intense effort and subterfuge undertaken by North Korean authorities to ensure the success of a scheme that has become a vital lifeline of foreign currency for the cash-strapped regime.\nNorth Korea's U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment.\nRemote IT workers can earn more than ten times what a conventional North Korean labourer working overseas in construction or other manual jobs earns, the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) said in 2022, and teams of them can collectively earn more than $3 million a year.\nReuters was not able to determine how much the scheme has generated over the years.\nSome of the scripts, designed to prepare the workers for interview questions, contain excuses for the need to work remotely.\n\"Richard\", a senior embedded software developer, said \"I (flew) to Singapore several weeks ago. My parents got Covid and I (decided) to be with family members for a while. Now, I am planning to go back to Los Angeles in three months. I am thinking that I could start work remotely right now, then I will be on board when I go back to LA.\"\nA North Korean IT worker who recently defected also examined the documents and confirmed their authenticity to Reuters: \"We would create 20 to 50 fake profiles a year until we were hired,\" he said.\nHe viewed the scripts, data and documents and said it was exactly the same thing he had been doing because he recognised the tactics and techniques used.\n\"Once I was hired, I would create another fake profile to get a second job,\" said the worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing security concerns.\nIn October, the DOJ and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized 17 website domains it said were used by North Korean IT workers to defraud businesses and $1.5 million in funds.\nNorth Korean developers working at U.S. companies had hidden behind pseudonymous email and social media accounts and generated millions of dollars a year on behalf of sanctioned North Korean entities through the scheme, the DOJ said.\n\"There is a risk to the North Korea government, as these privileged workers are exposed to dangerous realities about the world and their country's enforced backwardness,\" said Sokeel Park of Liberty in North Korea (LINK), an organisation that works with defectors.\nHARD CASH\nLast year, the U.S. government said North Korean IT workers were mainly located in China and Russia, with some in Africa and Southeast Asia, and can each earn up to $300,000 annually.\nAccording to his experience, the former IT worker said all are expected to earn at least $100,000, of which 30-40% is repatriated to Pyongyang, 30-60% spent on overhead expenses, and 10-30% pocketed by workers.\nHe estimated there were around 3,000 others like him overseas, and another 1,000 based within North Korea.\n\"I worked to earn foreign currency,\" he told Reuters. \"It differs between people but, basically, once you get a remote job you can work for as little as six months, or as long as three to four years.\"\n\"When you can't find a job, you freelance.\"\nThe researchers, part of Palo Alto's Unit 42 cyber research division, made the discovery when examining a campaign by North Korean hackers that targeted software developers.\nOne of the hackers left the documents exposed on a server, Unit 42 said, indicating there are links between North Korea's hackers and its IT workers, although the defector said espionage campaigns were for a select few: \"Hackers are trained separately. Those missions are not given to people like us,\" he said.\nStill, there is crossover. The DOJ and FBI have warned that North Korean IT workers may use access to hack their employers, and some of the leaked resumes indicated experience at cryptocurrency firms, an industry that has been long-targeted by North Korean hackers.\nFAKE IDENTITIES\nData from Constella Intelligence, an identity investigation firm, showed that one of the workers had accounts at over 20 freelancing websites in the United States, Britain, Japan, Uzbekistan, Spain, Australia and New Zealand.\nThe worker did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\nThe data, collated from leaks on the darkweb, also revealed an account on a website selling digital templates to create realistic-looking fake identification documents, including U.S. driving licences, visas and passports, Reuters found.\nThe documents unearthed by Unit 42 included resumes for 14 identities, a forged U.S. green card, interview scripts, and evidence that some workers had bought access to legitimate online profiles in order to appear more genuine.\nThe \"Richard\" in Singapore who was seeking remote IT work appeared to refer to a forged profile by the name of \"Richard Lee\" \u2013 the same name on the green card. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\nReuters found a LinkedIn account for a Richard Lee with the same profile photo who listed experience at Jumio, a digital identity verification company.\n\"We do not have any records of Richard Lee having been a current or former employee of Jumio,\" a Jumio spokesperson said. \u201cJumio does not have any evidence to suggest the company has ever had a North Korean employee within its workforce.\u201d\nReuters messaged the LinkedIn account seeking comment, but received no response. LinkedIn removed the account after receiving requests from Reuters for comment.\n\"Our team uses information from a variety of sources to detect and remove fake accounts, as we did in this case,\" a spokesperson said.

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014\nThe Air Force's vast fields of underground nuclear missile silos are rarely disturbed by more than the occasional wandering cow or floating spy balloon. But the service is now asking Congress to help with another unexpected danger: towering wind turbines, which are growing in number and size and are edging closer to the sites each year.\nThe silos share space on vast private farmlands with the turbines. Whereas the nuclear launch sites are almost undetectable \u2014 just small, rectangular plots of land marked only by antennae, a chain-link fence and a flat 110,000-ton (100,000-metric tonne) concrete silo blast door \u2014 the turbines are hundreds of feet high, with long, sweeping blades that have parts so large and long they dwarf the 18-wheeler flatbed trucks that transport them to new sites.\nAs nearby populations have grown, so have energy needs, and so have the number and size of the turbines. It's a boon for farmers and landowners, who can lease space on their lands to support both the military needs and wind power companies.\nBut the growth is making it dangerous for military helicopter crews. When an alarm triggers at a site, the UH-1 Huey crews fly in low and fast, often with security teams on board.\n\u201cWhen you think about a wind turbine, and even fields of wind turbines, they\u2019ll stretch for miles,\u201d said Staff Sgt. Chase Rose, a UH-1 Huey flight engineer at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. \u201cThey\u2019re monstrous, and then you have gigantic blades spinning on them as well. Not only is that a physical obstacle, but those turbines, they create the hazards like turbulence as well. That can be really dangerous for us to fly into. So it\u2019s a very complex situation, when you have to deal with those.\u201d\nSo the Air Force is asking Congress to pass legislation to create a 2-nautical-mile buffer zone around each site. The legislation has the support of wind energy advocates, but they caution against a one-size-fits-all approach. There are hundreds of underground silos spread across the U.S., in Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming.\n\u201cThe wind industry recognizes the nuclear missile silo mission is unique,\" said Jason Ryan, a spokesman for the American Clean Power Association, which worked with the Air Force and lawmakers on drafting language for a buffer zone. \"However, one-size-fits-all setbacks do not make sense for other (Department of Defense) missions or assets as site-specific and mission-specific evaluations are necessary to ensure military readiness.\u201d\nJo Dee Black, a spokeswoman for NorthWestern Energy, which operates some of the towers near Malmstrom's launch sites, did not say whether the firm is in support of the buffer zone but said \u201cwe have always and continue to support the critical role Malmstrom Air Force Base has in our nation\u2019s security.\"\n\u201cNorthWestern Energy and the U.S. Air Force have a long, successful history of collaboration that supports our missions of national security and providing safe, reliable energy service,\u201d Black said.\nLanguage to create a setback was included in the Senate version of the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act. The language is not in the House version of the bill and would need to be negotiated in conference.\nUnder the legislation, current towers would be unaffected, unless a company decided to refurbish an existing tower to make it taller.\nThat could still be a problem for the air crews. Some of the modern turbines have towers as tall as 650 feet, or nearly 200 meters, \u201cwhich is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty,\u201d Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael Lutton, who oversees all 450 missile silo sites, said earlier this year. Some rotor diameters, the width of the circle swept by the rotating blades, can be as much as 367 feet (112 meters), the distance from home plate to the left field pole at the Colorado Rockies' baseball stadium.\nOf the 450 sites, 46 are \u201cseverely\u201d encroached upon, which the Air Force defines as having more than half of the routes to the launch site closed due to obstructions.\nBut the service acknowledges the difficult position it is in. The farmers who have allowed it to use their lands for decades benefit from the income from the turbine leases, and the service does not want to appear to push back on environmental energy alternatives.\nThe Air Force continues to \u201csupport renewable energy efforts to include wind turbines, and we continue to work with energy industry partners to ensure the country\u2019s green energy needs are met,\u201d said Air Force Maj. Victoria Hight, a spokeswoman for F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. However, she said, \u201cthe encroaching turbines limit safe helicopter transit and nuclear security operations.\"\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show Lutton\u2019s rank and first name are Maj. Gen. Michael, not Lt. Gen. John.",

The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index plummeted 4.1% in its biggest plunge of the year.\nWith Amazon due to report later, there was no respite for the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' Wall St behemoths or the wider market ahead of Thursday's open. S&P500 and Nasdaq futures were down heavily overnight and the world stocks index at its lowest since March.\nEven as Israel appeared to prepare for an imminent ground invasion of Gaza, a renewed spike in long-term borrowing rates rankled alongside it - with 10-year Treasury yields rising back to within a whisker of the 16-year peak of 5% it hit earlier in the week.\nThe dollar surged to its highest level in almost three weeks, breaching 150 yen to hit its highest against the Japanese currency in more than a year - with no sign of Bank of Japan intervention so far.\nA busy week of debt auctions continues with 7-year note sales later as markets brace for confirmation that U.S. third-quarter economic growth accelerated to more than 5% - more than twice the rate in the June quarter.\nFresh evidence of that strength was seen on Wednesday as new single-family home sales surged to a 19-month high last month even as mortgage rates hit 23-year peaks near 8%.\nThe bond market seemed unimpressed even as the U.S. House of Representatives ended a three week hiatus by electing Republican Mike Johnson, a conservative with little leadership experience, as speaker.\nIn his speech, Johnson said he would establish a bipartisan commission to tackle the $33 trillion national debt. But his first task will be to respond to President Joe Biden's $106 billion spending request for aid to Israel, Ukraine and border security.\nEqually, there was little bond market cheer from news the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative labor deal with Ford - as the proposed accord provides a record 25% wage hike over the 4-1/2-year contract.\nEuropean stocks and the euro dropped sharply, meantime, as regional banking shares were hit ahead of the European Central Bank's policy decision later in the day.\nThe ECB is expected to signal the end of its interest rate tightening campaign amid mounting signs of economic weakness in the bloc, but markets are watching closely for information on its balance sheet rundown and possible quicker reduction of its bond stash.\nStandard Chartered shares slumped 11.3% and were set for their worst day in over three years as the lender's third-quarter pre-tax profit dropped 33% amid losses in China. BNP Paribas fell 4.1% on reporting a fall in trading revenue.\nDespite confirmation of a default by ailing property developer Country Garden, Chinese stocks seemed to buck the global trend and ended marginally higher after the week's slew of stimulus measures - including state fund buying and a plan to issue 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) of sovereign bonds.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:\n* European Central Bank policy decision and press conference. Turkish Central Bank policy decision\n* U.S. Q3 GDP; Sept durable goods orders, advance trade balance, pending home sales and wholesale/retail inventories; Kansas City Fed Oct business survey; weekly jobless claims\n* U.S. corporate earnings: Amazon, Intel, UPS, Honeywell, Merck, Comcast, Mastercard, Capital One, Principal Financial, Chipotle, Verisign, First Energy, Mohawk, Eastman Chemical, Weyerhauser, Camden Property, AO Smith, Bunge, Hasbro, PG&E, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Boston Scientific, Hershey, Northrop Grumman etc\n* U.S. Treasury auctions 7-year notes and 4-week bills\n* Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington\n* European Union summit in Brussels\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

        "text": "\nBy Jamie McGeever\nNov 16 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist. A bout of consolidation across Asian markets on Thursday is likely after the previous day's stellar gains, as investors adjust to what appears to be a decisive moment in the global interest rate and inflation cycle.\nThere is a growing consensus forming that major central banks' interest rate-raising cycle is over, a conviction strengthened by a series of inflation reports and other indicators from major economies.\nFigures on Wednesday showed that U.S. producer prices fell at their fastest pace since April 2020, and UK consumer inflation undershot all forecasts. Oil prices fell again on Wednesday, and are now down more than 10% year-on-year.\nInvestors are increasingly pricing in more rate cuts next year, bond yields and the dollar are coming under downward pressure, and stocks and risk assets are buoyant. All in, financial conditions in most countries are loosening.\nSome of that reversed on Wednesday - Treasury yields and the dollar rebounded a bit from the previous day's slump - which may keep a lid on Asian markets on Thursday, even though Wall Street held onto its gains and closed higher.\nInvestors could be forgiven for taking a breather on Thursday after such as huge rally on Wednesday that saw the MSCI Asia ex-Japan, MSCI Emerging Market index and Japan's Nikkei 225 all post their biggest gains in a year, of 2.5% or more.\nBut they also have other major economic and corporate news to digest, which will inject an extra dose of caution into the trading session.\nThe economic calendar sees the release of Japanese trade data, machinery orders and the closely-watched 'tertiary activity index', as well as Australian unemployment and Chinese house prices.\nJapan's GDP figures on Wednesday were much weaker than expected, leading economists at Barclays and elsewhere to cut their 2023 and 2024 growth forecasts.\nBut financial conditions in Japan are the loosest since 1990, according to Goldman Sachs, which is partly why the Bank of Japan has stepped up its hawkish rhetoric and may end its negative interest rate policy early next year.\nLaying that ground at a time when the economy is shrinking, however, is not ideal.\nChina's house price data will be closely watched for signs that the property sector is beginning to stabilize. There are signs of stabilization elsewhere in Chinese markets - the yuan is its strongest in three months against the dollar, and foreigners are increasing their holdings of China's onshore yuan bonds.\nOn the policy front, the Philippine central bank is expected to keep its key interest rate unchanged at 6.50% on Thursday, although there's an outside chance it might hike to 6.75%.\nOn the corporate front, China's Alibaba and Lenovo release their latest earnings reports.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:\n- Japan trade (October)\n- China house prices (October)\n- Philippines interest rate decision\n(By Jamie McGeever;)",

Shares rose 1.6% at 7 a.m. in early trading in New York.\nT-Mobile, along with rivals Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., has seen a slowdown in mobile-phone subscriber growth as the industry cools from the phone-buying frenzy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nBut the No. 2 carrier in the US has bucked the trend by cashing in on its lead in fast 5G airwaves, adding more rural territories to its coverage area and selling wireless internet access where broadband choices are few.\nT-Mobile said its fast 5G service has expanded to cover 300 million people in the US, doing so more than two months ahead of its expected schedule.\n\u201cWe announced this goal nearly three years ago, and then we got to work and got it done,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mike Sievert told investors Wednesday. \u201cTo this day, no one else in our industry has stated any plans to match it.\u201d\nT-Mobile turned in \u201ca solid performance that may be attributed to its 5G lead and strong brand in an increasingly competitive market,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst John Butler said in a note, adding that it led the industry in net phone additions.\nThe company raised its free cash flow guidance for the year to $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion, up from its previous guidance of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion.\nT-Mobile\u2019s results \u201creflect a stabilizing wireless competitive backdrop,\u201d Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Michael Rollins wrote in a note. \u201cWithin this context, T-Mobile retains opportunities to grow service revenues at or better than the industry, expand margins and improve financial flexibility to return capital to shareholders at an elevated pace.\u201d\nAs mobile phone growth slows, T-Mobile has also been working to expand its fixed wireless broadband base.

Two-year yields dropped to 4.942%, the lowest since Oct. 10.\nEarlier, Treasury yields slipped on Treasury Department plans to \"gradually\" boost the size of its debt auctions to meet financing needs.\nThe Treasury Department said the size of most auctions from November to January 2024 will increase and that it will need one additional quarter of increases to meet its funding plans.\nThe U.S. dollar index was firmer following the Fed statement but was last nearly flat. Against the yen, the dollar dropped 0.4% to 151.09.\nThe Japanese yen fell sharply on Tuesday, when the Bank of Japan tweaked its bond yield control policy, loosening its grip on long-term rates and pushing the currency to a one-year low against the dollar.\nThat was followed by a fresh and sterner warning from Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Wednesday that authorities stood ready to respond to recent \"one-sided, sharp\" moves in the currency.\nOil prices fell to a three-week low after the Fed decision. Brent futures fell 39 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $84.63 a barrel.

        "text": "\nCalifornia has a bold plan to reverse its cost-of-living crisis and stem the exodus of residents leaving the Golden State for regions like Florida and Texas. It\u2019s vowed to create 2.5 million new homes, one million of them affordable, over the next eight years. So, what's getting in the state's way? First on the list: the city of San Francisco.\nThe city by the bay has some of the biggest barriers to building housing. The state Department of Housing and Community Development wrote as much in a scathing, first-of-its-kind report on Wednesday that painted the city as Ground Zero of the state\u2019s housing crisis\u2014and San Francisco's mayor London Breed agrees.\n\u201cThe state sent a clear message that San Francisco needs to do better on housing,\u201d Breed said in a Medium post. \u201cNo more delaying and denying the changes we\u2019ve committed to make in our Housing Element to build housing faster.\u201d\nIn its report, HCD argued that many local practices actually violate state law, while also citing a complicated permitting process, too much deference to local politicians, and skyrocketing construction costs.\n\u201cSan Francisco has the longest timelines in the state for advancing a housing project from submittal to construction,\u201d the report found. Just to get approved, or \u201centitled\u201d in the city\u2019s langage, takes 523 days on average, 50% more than the next-slowest jurisdiction. After the approval, it takes another 605 days\u2014that\u2019s nearly two years\u2014to issue other building permits.\nThat's thanks to local control, and a discretionary process that can override essentially any development, even those that conform to existing zoning regulations\u2014meaning projects can be delayed by officials\u2019 demands or by a single community member unhappy about some aspect of the development.\nFollowing the report's release, in a statement, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s affordability crisis is one of our own making\u2014the decisions we made limited the creation of housing we need. Nowhere is this fact more evident than in San Francisco.\"\n\u201cSan Francisco is an outlier on housing approvals, in part because of how it applies a blanket discretionary review process to all building permits,\u201d the report found. The city\u2019s \u201chousing approval processes are also notoriously complex and cumbersome, creating unpredictability and uncertainty,\u201d it found, creating an environment where only seasoned developers have the know-how to navigate the process, while new ones don\u2019t even try.\nWhile that crushes housing development, it also means the housing that does make it through is very expensive, as previously reported\u2014because only luxury developers can afford the drawn-out process.\nIn theory, the community input requirement \u201callows groups without power to shape zoning to advocate for their neighborhood needs before a development is built,\u201d the report says. But in reality, \u201c\u2018affluent NIMBYs\u2019 can, and do, weaponize these process requirements to block housing,\u201d the report concludes. That leaves the city in the worst of all worlds: The existing zoning, which the report calls inequitable, doesn\u2019t change, and little new housing is added.\nExamples of such delays abound. Earlier this year, the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors halted a plan to replace a single-family home in Nob Hill with 10 townhomes, in part over locals\u2019 concerns about the shade the building would cast on a nearby park. And two years ago, supervisors delayed a nearly 500-unit building that was destined for a parking lot used by Nordstrom shoppers, the New York Times noted; now that Nordstrom has abandoned the city, it no longer needs the lot\u2014and building costs have shot up so much the project is no longer financially viable.\nOther parts of the Bay Area face similar struggles. A 315-unit building in Lafayette, in the East Bay, is finally moving ahead after a 12-year delay in the courts. In nearby Atherton, a wealthy Silicon Valley enclave, residents including the billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and NBA superstar Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors vocally opposed the construction of multifamily housing in the neighborhood on two separate occasions.\nThe report questions San Francisco\u2019s ability to meet the state-mandated, and very ambitious,housing goals by the 2031 deadline. To keep pace, the city needs to build over 10,000 new housing units every year over the next eight years, half of them affordable. It\u2019s only managed about 40% of that pace so far, the report found. This year, it\u2019s been averaging a dismal one unit a day, the report found.\nSome housing advocates cheered the report. \u201cFor decades, San Francisco has flouted state laws regulating housing projects,\u201d the pro-development advocacy organization San Francisco YIMBY said in a statement. \u201cThis report will obliterate local obstructionism in San Francisco, and SF YIMBY could not be more excited.\u201d State Senator Scott Weiner, who authored Senate Bills 423, 4, and 593, all of which were recently signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in an effort to reduce barriers to housing development. called the report \u201cutter condemnation,\u201d noting \u201c18 policies & practices\u201d that violate state law.\nIf the city doesn\u2019t shape up, HCD warns, it will face consequences\u2014such as losing state funds, being fined by the courts, losing its authority to determine local land use and, most severely, the \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy,\u201d or the automatic approval of any project meeting certain requirements.\nThe city\u2019s mayor made it clear that the state could decertify San Francisco\u2019s housing element if it fails to build more housing\u2014-and if that were to happen, it would be \u201cdisastrous,\u201d in her words.\n\u201cThis is in addition to the ongoing and very real consequences of not building housing, which we\u2019ve been experiencing for years,\u201d Breed said. \u201cPeople will continue to be displaced from the city they grew up in. Workers will not be able to live here and work in our restaurants, shops, and offices. Families will leave the city when they can\u2019t find enough space.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

That processing plant has a capacity of 110,000 tons of concentrates a year.\nThe closures, along with shutdowns in Ireland and Portugal by other producers, will reduce an expected zinc market surplus for 2024, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.\n\"However, with most zinc used to galvinise steel, which faces demand challenges from weak construction activity, we would still see surpluses. In our view, a stronger demand recovery is needed for a more sustained rally.\"\nZinc prices on the London Metal Exchange have slumped 16% so far this year, but spiked as much as 7% to a one-month high on Wednesday before paring gains to trade up 3.2% at $2,509 a metric ton.\nDuring the suspension, Nyrstar will conduct drilling operations to find additional zinc, germanium and gallium resources, it added.\nIn July, Nyrstar said it was looking at germanium and gallium projects in Australia, Europe and the U.S., which could help ease any shortages created by China's export controls on the materials used for computer chips.

The new target would bring Rolls closer to its rivals, such as General Electric, its major competitor in the widebody sector.\nShares in Rolls-Royce, which have soared 161% in the year to date, gained 4% in early deals following the announcement of the new targets.\n\"We are setting compelling and achievable financial targets for the mid-term which will take Rolls-Royce significantly beyond any previous financial performance,\" Erginbilgic said on Tuesday.\nAgency Partners analyst Nick Cunnigham said that the targets imply that Rolls-Royce is willing to shed revenues in exchange for better profitability.\n\"If so, that is a deeper culture change from Rolls-Royce\u2019s traditional market share optimisation approach of past decades,\" he said.\nThe company, which also has defence and power systems units, announced a group-wide divestment programme, targeting up to 1.5 billion pounds in the next five years, as it focuses capital on core parts of its business.\nRolls-Royce, which sacrificed profitability to build scale in the widebody market, powers Airbus's A330neo and A350 aircraft and its engines are one of two options on Boeing's 787.\nIts finances were hit by problems with its Trent 1000 engine and by the pandemic, which grounded long-haul aircraft and wiped out Rolls-Royce's revenue tied to engine flying hours.\nRecovery under Erginbilgic has been rapid, with a five-fold rise in first-half operating profit reported in August, helped by increasing prices for maintaining its engines and tightly managing its cost base.\nErginbilgic said Rolls was well positioned to re-enter the narrowbody market through partnering on the next new engine programme, with its next-generation UltraFan technology being a vital step.

They see increases of $3 billion for 2s, 5s, and 10s, $2 billion for FRNs, 3s and 30s, and $1 billion in 7s, 20s, and 5y and 10y TIPS.\nThe announcement on July 31 of $1.007 trillion in funding needs for the third quarter badly spooked the bond market, leading to the sharp increase in auction volumes.\nIt is also notable that the borrowing kept climbing even though the economy surprised everyone with its strength. Nominal GDP growth in the third quarter was a blistering 8.5% annualised, the kind of pace China used to boast of and a pace that would normally be a bonanza for tax receipts.\nThe sharp rise in market borrowing costs has convinced analysts the Federal Reserve will stand pat at its policy meeting this week, with futures implying a 97% chance of rates staying at 5.25-5.5%.\nThe market has also priced in 165 basis points of easing for 2024, starting around mid-year 2024.\nThe earnings season also continues this week with Apple, Airbnb, McDonald's, Moderna and Eli Lilly among the many reporting. Results so far have been underwhelming, contributing to the S&P 500's retreat into correction territory.\nKey developments that could influence markets on Monday:\n- Bank of Japan begins two-day policy meeting\n- German GDP and CPI data, EU business climate\n- Appearances by ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos and Riksbank Governor Erik Thed\u00e9en\n- Treasury announces borrowing estimates for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2024.\n(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

It's too early to say that,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street in Boston.\n\"A lot of the questions that we were asking that drove yields higher we're still asking,\" he said, referring to the bond rally that raised the 10-year yield above 5% two weeks ago. Bond prices move inversely to their yield.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell did not comment on monetary policy or the economic outlook in prepared remarks at a U.S. central bank statistic conference on Wednesday. Investors have ramped up bets for Fed rate cuts next year, though the timing is unclear.\nMarkets are pricing in an almost 50% chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points as soon as May, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, up from about 41% a week earlier.\nBut futures also call for the Fed's overnight lending rate to remain above 5% through next June.\nMSCI's all-country world stock index closed flat, rising just 0.01 point, after last week posting its biggest weekly jump in almost a year.

        "text": "\n(Repeats Friday's column without any changes)\nBy Jamie McGeever\nORLANDO, Florida, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury may need to keep things short for the sake of the long end.\nTreasury's staid debt management operations are rarely driven by market timing, but the re-surfacing of a long-absent \"term premium\" may be an exception that paves the way for more short-term bill sales next year than it had originally planned.\nThe Quarterly Refunding program and projections to be announced on Nov. 1 come as mounting deficits and a heavier interest rate burden have substantially increased Treasury's funding needs.\nThe big question is where on the maturity curve Treasury places the extra borrowing to calm what has become a restive bond market.\nTreasury, whose goal is a \"regular and predictable\" debt issuance framework at the lowest cost to the taxpayer over time, is set to substantially increase so-called coupon issuance of maturities beyond 12-month tenors in fiscal year 2024 to rebalance this year's $1.6 trillion surge in bill sales.\nTreasury's need to manage liquidity, the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening program and broader government funding needs will see an increase in net bond supply across the curve.\nBut the pendulum may not swing back as far as expected.\nLong-dated bonds have been crushed since the last refunding announcement in August, sending borrowing rates spiraling to their highest since 2006-07.\nNot only is it much more costly to raise long-term debt than was projected only three months ago, debt sustainability concerns have re-emerged at the margin.\nAnd that is reflected in the return of the \"term premium,\" the amorphous amount of compensation investors demand for buying long-dated bonds instead of rolling over bills. It is a premium for unknowable and unquantifiable risks in the future, beyond current assumptions on the long-term path of inflation or policy rates.\nA San Francisco Fed model estimates that the term premium on the 10-year Treasury bond has risen around 100 basis points since July. A New York Fed model estimates it has risen around 125 basis points, and is now the highest in eight years.\nThis has helped steepen the yield curve by around 85 basis points over the same period.\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley reckon the term premium and debt sustainability worries could prompt a rethink of the bill-coupon supply balance.\n\"Historically, the Treasury is not known be reactive to market conditions or yield levels. However, the recent rise in yields and term premiums has been sharp,\" they wrote on Tuesday.\n\"We expect more T-bills in the coming quarters vs. what we had expected earlier.\"\n5% YIELD = ROBUST DEMAND\nThey estimate an additional net bill supply of around $750 billion in calendar year 2024. Their counterparts at Bank of America and TD Securities are penciling in $732 billion and $677 billion in fiscal year 2024, respectively.\nBill supply around these levels would be well down on net issuance of just over $1.6 trillion in fiscal year 2023. But it is still substantial and will keep the share of bills in the total stock of marketable debt above the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee's recommended 15-20% range.\nThis ratio is currently hovering around 20.5% and could rise further above 22% next year and stay there for some time, analysts estimate. But this is hardly a red line - it exceeded 30% in the Great Financial Crisis and slumped to 10% in 2016.\nThe share of bills in Treasury's total marketable debt outstanding isn't expected to come back below the 20% for several years yet, although analysts don't expect the weighted average maturity of Treasury debt next year to move much from the current level around 70 months.\n\"Bills as a % of outstanding (debt) will continue to grow due to higher deficits, unless coupon auction sizes continue to increase beyond our forecasts,\" BofA's rates strategy team wrote on Tuesday.\nIn an ideal world, Treasury would not choose to rely on such short-term funding needs. It is risky, and open to sudden shocks like interest rate swings or buyers' strikes.\nBut right now it could take some of the heat off the long end of the curve and give Treasury some breathing space before going back out the curve later next year when, ideally, yields are lower and the Fed is cutting interest rates.\nThis strategy will have a greater chance of success if bill supply can be absorbed - all else equal, higher-than-expected bill issuance would push bill rates up.\nBut there are plenty buyers.\nCash-rich money market funds, with around $6 trillion of assets under management, currently hold around 27% of all T-bills outstanding, up from around 15% earlier this year.\nThat increase is a result of funds switching to bills from the Fed's reverse repo facility, which has been halved to around $1 trillion since June. There is plenty of scope to increase their share too - post-COVID it was as high as 45%.\nEven though bill supply will remain high in the coming years, yields well above 5% will attract buyers.\n\"We expect demand to remain robust given their attractive yield and our expectation that the Fed is likely finished with rate hikes,\" TD Securities wrote on Monday.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n(By Jamie McGeever Editing by Marguerita Choy)",

        "text": "\nAmazon (AMZN) entered the AI hype zone.\nShares of the e-commerce beast surged more than 7% early Friday after reporting above-consensus earnings on Thursday, supported by bullish comments around artificial intelligence.\nCEO Andy Jassy told analysts on the earnings call that AI represents an opportunity worth \"tens of billions\" for Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This year, AWS launched its Bedrock AI service, which streamlines the development of large language models.\n\u201cOur generative AI business is growing very, very quickly,\u201d said Jassy.\nIn September, Amazon invested $1.25 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. The investment could go up to $4 billion over time.\nAI could provide the growth spurt that AWS is looking for. In Q3, the division fell slightly short of analysts' net sales expectations, coming in at $23.06 billion, against the $23.13 billion Wall Street expected.\nHowever, there were silver linings, as AWS sales were up 12% year over year and the division's operating income is also on the upswing, coming in at $7 billion, a roughly 29% increase from last year. That 12% growth is \"just enough to keep the goblins away,\" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote on Thursday after earnings.\nIt's been a week of mixed cloud results, making Jassy's comments stick out.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft (MSFT) reported better-than-anticipated growth in its Azure cloud business, while Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) cloud growth numbers disappointed.\nAWS growth has been under a microscope this year, and it's a subject that has been \"getting the most airtime with investors,\" JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth wrote before earnings. In a call with media on Thursday, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said that he doesn't believe AWS growth has stalled completely, instead characterizing the cloud business as in a \"delicate\" transition.\nThe company is slowing down its cost-cutting moves as it looks to serve more customers and increasingly monetize its services.\nHere are the key numbers that Amazon reported, as compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\nNet sales: $143.08 billion actual, versus $141.56 billion expected\nAWS net sales: $23.06 billion actual, versus $23.13 billion expected\nEarnings per share: $0.94 actual, versus $0.58 expected\nOperating margin: 7.8% actual, versus 5.46% expected\nQ4 net sales: $160 billion-$167 billion actual, versus $166.57 billion expected\nCurrently, analyst recommendations for Amazon come out to 63 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells.\nLooking ahead, keep an eye on those operating margins. Amazon's operating margins have been increasing \u2014 going up 32% between Q1 and Q2, and clocking a notable beat in Q3 \u2014 which suggests that Amazon's post-pandemic efficiency efforts have been working.\n\"We analyzed ten years of historical data and identified all periods when Amazon\u2019s operating margin either increased or decreased on a basis for two or more consecutive quarters,\" wrote Wedbush's Scott Devitt before earnings. \"We then compared share price returns during those periods, and found that on average, Amazon shares have appreciated 84% when operating margins are rising versus just 1% when operating margins are declining.\"\nAllie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\nRENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge in Nevada has dealt another legal setback to Native American tribes trying to halt construction of one of the biggest lithium mines in the world.\nU.S. District Judge Miranda Du granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss their claims the mine is being built illegally near the sacred site of an 1865 massacre along the Nevada-Oregon line.\nBut she said in last week's order the three tribes suing the Bureau of Land Management deserve another chance to amend their complaint to try to prove the agency failed to adequately consult with them as required by the National Historic Preservation Act.\n\u201cGiven that the court has now twice agreed with federal defendants (and) plaintiffs did not vary their argument ... the court is skeptical that plaintiffs could successfully amend it. But skeptical does not mean futile,\u201d Du wrote Nov. 9.\nShe also noted part of their case is still pending on appeal at the 9th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, which indicated last month it likely will hear oral arguments in February as construction continues at Lithium Nevada\u2019s mine at Thacker Pass about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of Reno.\nDu said in an earlier ruling the tribes had failed to prove the project site is where more than two dozen of their ancestors were killed by the U.S. Cavalry Sept. 12, 1865.\nHer new ruling is the latest in a series that have turned back legal challenges to the mine on a variety of fronts, including environmentalists' claims it would violate the 1872 Mining Law and destroy key habitat for sage grouse, cutthroat trout and pronghorn antelope.\nAll have argued the bureau violated numerous laws in a rush to approve the mine to help meet sky-rocketing demand for lithium used in the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles.\nLithium Nevada officials said the $2.3 billion project remains on schedule to begin production in late 2026. They say it's essential to carrying out President Joe Biden's clean energy agenda aimed at combating climate change by reducing dependence on fossil fuels.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve dedicated more than a decade to community engagement and hard work in order to get this project right, and the courts have again validated the efforts by Lithium Americas and the administrative agencies,\u201d company spokesman Tim Crowley said in an email to The Associated Press.\nDu agreed with the government's argument that the consultation is ongoing and therefore not ripe for legal challenge.\nThe tribes argued it had to be completed before construction began.\n\u201cIf agencies are left to define when consultation is ongoing and when consultation is finished ... then agencies will hold consultation open forever \u2014 even as construction destroys the very objects of consultation \u2014 so that agencies can never be sued,\u201d the tribal lawyers wrote in recent briefs filed with the 9th Circuit.\nWill Falk, representing the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony and Summit Lake Paiute Tribe, said they\u2019re still considering whether to amend the complaint by the Dec. 9 deadline Du set, or focus on the appeal.\n\u201cDespite this project being billed as `green,' it perpetrates the same harm to Native peoples that mines always have,\u201d Falk told AP. \u201cWhile climate change is a very real, existential threat, if government agencies are allowed to rush through permitting processes to fast-track destructing mining projects like the one at Thacker Pass, more of the natural world and more Native American culture will be destroyed.\u201d\nThe Paiutes call Thacker Pass \u201cPee hee mu\u2019huh,\u201d which means \u201crotten moon.\u201d They describe in oral histories how Paiute hunters returned home in 1865 to find the \u201celders, women, and children\" slain and \u201cunburied and rotting.\u201d\nThe Oregon-based Burns Paiute Tribe joined the Nevada tribes in the appeal. They say BLM\u2019s consultation efforts with the tribes \u201cwere rife with withheld information, misrepresentations, and downright lies.\u201d",

        "text": "\nBy Francesco Guarascio\nHANOI (Reuters) - Intel has shelved a planned investment in Vietnam that could have nearly doubled the U.S. chipmaker's operation there, one person briefed on the plans said, in a blow to the country's growing ambitions in the chips industry.\nThe Southeast Asian electronics manufacturing hub is home to Intel's largest factory worldwide for assembling, packaging and testing chips, and has been banking on the company further expanding there especially after Joe Biden announced deals to support Vietnam's chips industry during a visit in September.\nVietnam is keen to position itself as an alternative to China and Taiwan, amid political risks and trade tensions with the United States.\nBut shortly after Biden's visit, U.S. officials informed a select group of U.S. businessmen and experts that Intel had shelved an expansion plan, one of the participants in the meeting told Reuters.\nThe source, who declined to be named because the information was confidential, said Intel had made that decision around July.\nThe company did not say why it had called off the expansion, the person said, but a second source who attended two separate meetings in recent weeks between U.S. companies and top Vietnamese officials said Intel had raised concerns about the stability of power supplies and excessive bureaucracy.\nOne of those meetings took place last week in Hanoi and was attended by Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Tran Luu Quang.\nAsked about the plan, Intel declined to comment but told Reuters: \"Vietnam will continue to be a critical part of our global manufacturing operations as demand for semiconductors grows.\"\nThe U.S. embassy in Hanoi declined to comment. The Vietnamese government did not reply to requests for comment.\nIntel's about-turn would be a blow to Vietnam's growing ambitions to play a larger role in the global semiconductor industry. It has been holding talks with chipmakers, hoping to lure firms seeking to diversify their supply chain.\nThe decision by Intel comes after it announced large investments in Europe in June and Vietnam suffered power shortages in the same month, forcing many manufacturers to temporarily suspend production.\nIntel is also expanding its investment in chip packaging in Malaysia, one of Vietnam's main Southeast Asian rivals.\nDuring Biden's visit to Hanoi, the White House unveiled new initiatives and investments by U.S. chips companies including Amkor, Synopsys and Marvell. Intel was not mentioned.\n\"You cannot take for granted that because Intel has already invested here it will invest more,\" Chung Seck, partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie Vietnam told Reuters.\nReuters reported in February that Intel was planning a new investment in Vietnam that could be worth about $1 billion, to boost its $1.5 billion factory in the country. Asked about the possible investment plan at the time, Intel told Reuters: \"Vietnam is an important part of our global manufacturing network, but we have not announced any new investments.\"\nVietnam government's official portal had mentioned plans to attract $3.3 billion in additional investment from Intel, but it later removed that reference after the media reported it.\nIntel and other multinationals have pressed the Vietnamese government to offer handouts worth millions of dollars when it introduces a new levy on large companies as part of a global tax overhaul. Plans for the tax and subsidies, due to be imposed next year, are still being discussed.\n(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio @fraguarascio; additional reporting by Max Cherney in San Francisco and Khanh Vu in Hanoi; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Miral Fahmy)",

        "text": "\nApple plans to add support for the RCS standard on iOS next year, the iPhone-maker said Thursday in a major reversal that would resolve the widespread issue of compatibility in text messaging between iPhones and Android smartphones, but stopped short of eliminating what is known colloquially as the \"green bubble\" dread.\nApple's longstanding unwillingness to support RCS has perpetuated fragmentation in messaging ecosystems, particularly affecting Android users, critics have argued over the years. Apple's stance, often seen as maintaining ecosystem exclusivity, stirred debate in the tech community over interoperability and user convenience.\nWell, no more. In an abrupt announcement today, Apple said it, too, believes that \"RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS.\" The company, which plans to roll out the support next year, added: \"This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users.\"\nThe major reversal follows Google's repeated request -- and public pressure on -- Apple to add support for RCS to iPhones. \"People have talked about 'green bubbles' as an Android problem,\" Hiroshi Lockheimer, SVP at Google, tweeted last year, referring to the visual distinction seen when a message is sent from an Android user to an iPhone, where it appears in a green bubble.\nWhile Apple plans to adopt RCS, it has confirmed that those messages will still be displayed in green bubbles.\n\"We\u2019re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We\u2019re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards. By not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,\" he tweeted.\nApple, too, hasn't been shy about its feeling on RCS. Apple chief Tim Cook dismissed the idea of his company adopting RCS in iMessage a year ago, and suggested the questioner at a conference to buy their mom an iPhone.\nRich Communication Services, or RCS, is the collective effort of a number of industry players to supercharge the traditional SMS with modern features such as richer texts and end-to-end encryption. Google, Samsung and a number of other firms, including telecom operators, have rolled out support for RCS to over 800 millions users worldwide in recent years.\nCritics argue that the disruption in group chats and interactions between Android and iPhone users has historically deterred many from transitioning to Android smartphones -- and it's by design. This tactic came to light in Apple's legal battle with Epic Games, where internal discussions revealed a conscious decision to keep iMessage within its ecosystem.\nDuring the legal dispute, a wealth of internal Apple documents became accessible to the public. These documents exposed a prolonged internal debate about introducing iMessage to Android-operated devices. \u201cIn the absence of a strategy to become the primary messaging service for bulk of cell phone users, I am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s chief software executive, said in a 2013 email.\nPhil Schiller, the then marketing chief, echoed this sentiment in 2016, advising Cook in an email, \"Moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us.\" That same year, an email from a former Apple executive cautioned that iMessage creates significant user retention, describing it as \"serious lock-in.\"\nApple's Thursday decision, coincidentally, follows Google and many telecom operators recently urging EU regulators to make Apple designate iMessage as a \"core\" service under the new Digital Markets Act, forcing the iPhone-maker to make the chat app fully compatible with rivals. As TechCrunch first reported this month, Apple has disclosed in a filing that it \"expects to make\" several policy changes to comply with the new guidelines that go into effect next year.",

        "text": "\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Toyota\u2019s July-September profit jumped nearly threefold from a year ago as vehicle sales grew around the world and a cheap yen boosted the Japanese automaker\u2019s overseas earnings.\nToyota Motor Corp. reported Wednesday 1.28 trillion yen ($8.5 billion) in quarterly profit, up from 434 billion yen the previous year. Quarterly sales rose 24% to 11.43 trillion yen ($75.7 billion) from 9.22 trillion yen.\nA cheap yen is a plus for Japan\u2019s giant exporters like Toyota by raising the value of its overseas earnings when translated into yen. The U.S. dollar was trading at about 145 Japanese yen in the latest quarter, up from 138 yen. It\u2019s trading above 150 yen lately.\nThe manufacturer of the Camry sedan, Prius hybrid and Lexus luxury models raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year through March 2024 to 3.95 trillion yen ($26 billion), up from the previous projection of 2.5 trillion yen.\nThe forecast, if realized, marks an improvement from the previous fiscal year\u2019s 2.45 trillion yen profit, and will be a record high for Toyota.\nToyota is expecting its vehicle sales to grow in most major regions, officials said. Toyota\u2019s vehicle sales for July-September grew from the previous year in the U.S., Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia, totaling more than 2.4 million vehicles globally, up from 2.1 million the previous year.\nToyota kept unchanged its forecast of selling 11.38 million vehicles for the full fiscal year worldwide.\nToyota has acknowledged it has fallen behind in battery electric vehicles to frontrunner rivals like U.S. EV maker Tesla and BYD of China. Toyota has shown concepts recently that reflect how it\u2019s serious about catching up.\nEarlier this week, Toyota said it\u2019s investing an additional $8 billion in the hybrid and electric vehicle battery factory it\u2019s constructing in North Carolina, more than doubling its prior investments.\nThe new investment is expected to create 3,000 additional jobs, to a total of more than 5,000 jobs when its first U.S. automotive battery plant begins operations near Greensboro in 2025.\nThe plant is designed to be Toyota\u2019s main lithium-ion battery production site in North America and will be a key supplier for the Kentucky-based plant that\u2019s building its first U.S.-made electric vehicles.\nToyota sold fewer than 25,000 EVs worldwide last year, although in the first eight months of this year, it sold 65,000, mostly outside Japan. Toyota is targeting sales of 1.5 million EVs a year by 2026 and 3.5 million by 2030.\nA shortage of computer chips caused by the social restrictions of the coronavirus pandemic had previously slammed the supply chain and hurt Toyota sales. But that has gradually eased.\nVehicles that aren\u2019t gas-guzzlers are increasingly popular in various markets because of environmental concerns. Besides battery EVs, Toyota is also banking on other kinds of ecological vehicles, such as fuel cells that run on hydrogen and hybrids that have both an electric motor and gasoline engine.\n___\nHannah Schoenbaum in Raleigh, N.C. contributed to this report.

In August, Reuters exclusively reported that some companies trying to exit Russia were facing big jumps in costs as Moscow demanded ever larger discounts on price tags of assets they were seeking to sell. Russia has steadily tightened exit requirements since Western companies started leaving soon after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\nThe rouble tumbled past the psychological threshold of 100 to the dollar in August and again in September, leading Russian authorities to introduce capital controls and the central bank to increase interest rates in an effort to defend the currency. The rouble has recovered sharply in recent weeks.\nThe FT cited an investment banker as saying that foreign currency transfers abroad had been limited to $20 million per day and a seven-day deadline had been imposed on closing a sale, effectively preventing sellers from receiving more than $140 million.\nAnother person working on several exit deals said Russia's government commission on foreign asset sales had imposed an informal cap of $500 million that could be transferred overseas.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said demands that foreign companies receive payments in roubles were not linked to the currency's recent drop in value.\nPeskov said questions on specifics should be addressed to the government commission on foreign asset sales, but said companies leaving must exit on the commission's terms.\n\"Of course, there can be no free exit now, and the commission strictly regulates this,\" Peskov told reporters.\nThe FT had earlier quoted Peskov as saying that Russia was creating \"the most favourable conditions for the rouble\".\nThe Kremlin now demands a 50% discount on any sale and a contribution to the Russian budget of at least 10% of the sale price, dubbed an \"exit tax\" by Washington.

        "text": "\nA look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nA sideswipe at the last remaining triple-A U.S. sovereign credit rating appears to have been batted away by bond investors so far - but the lingering risk of a government shutdown this week keeps a cloud over markets.\nMoody's credit ratings firm on Friday lowered its outlook on U.S. government debt to \"negative\" from \"stable,\" citing large fiscal deficits and a decline in debt affordability and dysfunction in congress.\nIt's the last of the three major rating agencies to maintain a top rating for the U.S. Treasury as Fitch lowered its rating in August and S&P removed its AAA in 2011.\nMoody's analyst William Foster told Reuters on Friday the chance of a \"significant policy response\" to rectify the fiscal situation probably wouldn't happen until 2025 \"because of the reality of the political calendar next year.\"\nAnd yet the clunky machinations of Congress and gridlock between the two main parties mean there's still a chance government operations could be shut down as soon as Friday.\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled a Republican stopgap spending measure on Saturday aimed at averting it and pushing the budget standoff into next year - but the measure quickly ran into opposition from both sides.\nAll the more impressive then that Treasuries seem so calm first thing on Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield hovering at about last week's close at 4.62% - 3 basis points below Friday's intraday high and still some 40bps below the October's peaks above 5%.\nThe dollar index was only marginally lower, with the dollar/yen exchange rate surging again to its highest in more than a year - and within a whisker of the 33-year high set last October despite Japanese intervention warnings.\nOn one level, there's some relief the AAA rating was maintained despite the darker outlook. And on another level, there's a mixed take on the implications of a shutdown - not least that it would dampen further economic activity in an already slower fourth quarter.\nAnd that would at least keep the Federal Reserve at bay despite its warnings last week that another rate hike was still on the table.\nHowever, the Fed focus this week was likely as much on the October consumer price inflation report on Tuesday and the retail sales data on Wednesday for guidance. Prices are expected to have remained sticky last month, while high street sales slowed.\nRetail will be a theme of the week in corporate earnings too, with Tyson Foods out on later on Monday, Home Depot on Tuesday, Target on Wednesday and Walmart on Thursday. This month's Thanksgiving holiday also focuses minds on shopping too and the resilience of the consumer.\nOverall, the sharp rally in Wall St stocks on Friday also showed a persistent seasonal bid for equities despite a rough week and Fed reality check on easing hopes. Futures were slightly in the red ahead of Monday's bell, but the ViX volatility gauge remained subdued around 15.\nWorld stocks followed through with slight gains on the back Wall St's late week strength, with China's bourses more mixed ahead of a big economic data release schedule this week - including industrial and retail readouts for last month.\nHowever, the main set-piece may well be in San Francisco where President Joe Biden and China's President Xi Jinping are due to hold a much anticipated summit on Wednesday.\nElsewhere, British markets and the pound were stable amid a UK government reshuffle that saw the interior minister Suella Braverman lose her job and former Prime Minister David Cameron return as foreign minister.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday: * October Federal Budget, New York Fed's Oct inflation expectations survey * Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook speaks; Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann speaks * U.S. corporate earnings: Tyson Foods, Henry Schein * U.S. Treasury auctions 3-, 6-month bills\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

The Bloomberg US Treasury Index rose 0.2% on Monday and is now back about where it ended 2022.\nA negative term premium is a sign that that the economic outlook is deteriorating, according to George Goncalves, head of US macro strategy at MUFG.\nRead more: \u2018Dark Matter\u2019 Bond Metric Mesmerizes Wall Street and Washington\nStill, bond investors are getting ahead of themselves in betting inflation has been tamed, said Alberto Gallo, chief investment officer and co-founder of Andromeda Capital Management Ltd. in London. \u201cWe see reflation risks on the horizon in the US and a mild recession in the euro zone.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of easing priced in in rates markets and not enough slowdown risk priced in,\u201d said Gallo. \u201cInvestors are underestimating the left tail of recession, which would hurt equity and credit.\u201d\nUS 10-year yields have tumbled more than half a percentage point from a 16-year high of 5.02% touched on Oct. 23. The pace of the yield decline has fueled speculation it may have been turbocharged by hedge funds forced to bail out of outsized bets that yields would keep climbing.\n\u201cThis decline in bond yields has to do less with investors changing opinions about debt or inflation and more to do with systematic investors being forced to cover their previous extreme short positions in government bonds,\u201d said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in London.\n--With assistance from Michael Mackenzie.\n(Corrects job title in the 8th paragraph in a story first published on Nov. 21)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "text": "\nOct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell about 4% on Monday on record output and forecasts for milder weather and lower heating next week than previously expected. On its first day as the front-month, gas futures for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 14.6 cents, or 4.2%, from where that contract traded on Friday to $3.337 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 10:21 a.m. EDT (1421 GMT) on Monday. That, however, was still up about 5% from where the November contract closed when it was still the front-month on Friday. It also put the contract on track for its highest close since Oct. 12 and pushed it into technically overbought territory for the first time since mid-October. Even though the front-month gained about 9% last week, speculators cut their net long futures and options positions on the New York Mercantile and Intercontinental Exchanges for a second week in a row to their lowest since early October, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commitments of Traders report. One bearish factor that has weighed on the futures market for most of this year has been lower spot or next-day prices at the Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana. The spot market has traded below front-month futures for 172 out of 207 trading days so far this year, according to data from financial firm LSEG. Next-day prices at the Henry Hub gained about 13% to around $3.24 per mmBtu for Monday. Analysts have noted that so long as the futures market remains in contango and spot prices remain far enough below the front-month to cover margin and storage costs, traders should be able to lock in arbitrage profits by buying spot gas, storing it and selling a futures contract. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to an average of 104.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in October, up from 102.6 bcfd in September and a record high of 103.1 bcfd in July. Meteorologists forecast the weather will turn from colder than normal now to mostly near normal from Nov. 3-14. With milder weather coming, LSEG forecast U.S. gas demand in the Lower 48 states, including exports, would drop from 109.2 bcfd this week to 104.2 bcfd next week. The forecast for this week was higher than LSEG's outlook on Friday, but its forecast for next week was much lower. Pipeline exports to Mexico slid to an average of 6.8 bcfd so far in October, down from a monthly record high of 7.2 bcfd in September. Analysts, however, expect exports to Mexico to rise in coming months once U.S. energy company New Fortress Energy's plant in Altamira starts pulling in U.S. gas to turn into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export in November. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose to 13.7 bcfd so far in October, up from 12.6 bcfd in September but still below a monthly record high of 14.0 bcfd in April. The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar. Much higher global prices have fed demand for U.S. exports due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine.

For months, the rates had been depressed as DeFi\u2019s once lofty returns were nowhere to be found amid decades-high yields in the traditional bond market.\nThe surge in lending demand on DeFi has coincided with the reemergence of positive funding rates in the perpetual futures market, one of the most popular derivatives contracts in crypto. Data from tracker Coinglass show that the open interest-weighted funding rate turned positive this past weekend for tokens including XRP, which means that speculators betting on a price rally are willing to pay those expecting declines to keep their bullish positions open. XRP rallied 11% to 72.6 cents on Monday, while other major alt-coins such as Dogecoin are also trading higher.\n\u201cThere have been a number of \u2018wealth effects\u2019 that usually cause lending demand to go up when there\u2019s a huge run up in a particular token. There\u2019s also short-side lending demand from large holders,\u201d said Tarun Chitra, co-founder of crypto risk modeling platform Gauntlet. \u201cLeverage in DeFi is reflexive \u2014 when prices go up, there\u2019s naturally an increase in leverage demand for people who want to make longer-term speculative bets on the market moving in a particular direction.\u201d\nBitcoin rallied about 28% in October, the biggest monthly increase since January, as expectations grew that the US Securities and Exchange Commission soon will approve exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the original cryptocurrency after more than a decade of deliberations. Since then, Bitcoin\u2019s rally has spread to smaller tokens such as Solana, which was one of the best performing cryptocurrencies this year despite its close link to FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of fraud last week almost a year after the collapse of his crypto empire.\nThe rising borrowing rates in DeFi and funding rates in the perpetual futures market also have created arbitrage opportunities for traders to profit from the differences between the two.\n\u201cAave and perp rates generally should be somewhat correlated, as you can arbitrage between the two,\u201d said Spencer Hallarn, a derivatives trader at crypto investment firm GSR. \u201cOverall it speaks to the demand to own crypto\u201d in the derivatives market.\nThe blowups last year of a number of centralized lenders such as BlockFi also left DeFi lenders as some of the only places available for leveraged trades, according to Chitra. Darius Sit, founder and chief investment officer at Singapore-based crypto investment firm QCP, noted that the lending demand via over-the-counter desks is not elevated.\n\u201cLending and leverage is definitely coming back,\u201d said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. \u201cThis is a natural consequence of not just a pickup in investor interest, but also a pickup in volatility \u2014 volatility encourages leverage and therefor, demand for lending.\u201d\n(Updates XRP\u2019s Monday move in third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nTop-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications\nElon Musk\u2019s Brain Implant Startup Is About to Start Cutting\nWho\u2019s Ready for a Trump-Biden Rematch?

Home values were also up 3.9% over the last 12 months, according to the latest data released Tuesday, besting the 2.5% annual gain logged in August.\nThe index tracking home sales prices in the 20 largest US cities gained 0.7% in September from August, just missing the 0.8% increase that economists polled by Bloomberg were expecting. The index rose 3.9% compared to last September, in line with the Bloomberg forecast.\nThe resilience of home prices underscores how much low inventory is driving the housing market, even as rising mortgage prices worsen affordability and scare off some buyers.\nRead more: Mortgage rates at 20-year high: Is 2023 a good time to buy a house?\n\"We\u2019ve commented before on the breadth of the housing market\u2019s strength, which continued to be impressive,\" said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director at S&P DJI, in a press statement. \"Although this year\u2019s increase in mortgage rates has surely suppressed the quantity of homes sold, the relative shortage of inventory for sale has been a solid support for prices.\"\n\"Unless higher rates or exogenous events lead to general economic weakness, the breadth and strength of this month\u2019s report are consistent with an optimistic view of future results,\" he added.\nDetroit, San Diego, and New York led the way for the fastest-growing cities in the US. Detroit reported the highest year-over-year growth, with an annual increase of 6.7%. San Diego and New York followed with growth of 6.5% and 6.3%, respectively.\nPrevious private sector data showed that the national median home prices for all resale housing types rose 2.8% to $394,300 in September from $383,500 a year ago, even as housing transactions activity slumped 15.4% in the same period, the National Association of Realtors reported.\nRead more: How to buy a house in 2023\n\"For the third straight month, home prices are up from a year ago, confirming the pressing need for more housing supply,\" Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said about September's annual increase. \"As has been the case throughout this year, limited inventory and low housing affordability continue to hamper home sales\u2026\"\nHigher sales of new homes also is helping to boost prices. New home prices are generally higher than those of previously owned homes. In September, sales of new construction jumped 12.3% from August, with the median sales price coming in at $418,000.\nThe continued rise in prices is exacerbating the affordability crisis, which is also getting hammered by higher mortgage rates.\n\"Buyers really struggle in a housing market where we have higher interest rates and higher home prices that continue to go up too,\" Jessica Lautz, NAR's deputy chief economist, told Yahoo Finance.\nToday's homebuyers face borrowing costs that have nearly tripled since the summer of 2021, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was as low as 2.77%, according to Freddie Mac data. Now, the rate is well above 7%.\nRead more: 5 strategies to get the lowest mortgage rates in 2023\nNAR's affordability index \u2014 a measure of whether a typical family earns enough to afford a typical home \u2014 was 94.1 in September. Anything below 100 indicates an unaffordable market; the lower the number, the more unaffordable.\nHigher mortgage rates are also keeping a lid on inventory levels. Many homeowners have refrained from selling their houses to keep their low interest rate.\nAccording to the NAR, inventory at the end of September was 1.13 million, up 2.7% from August but down 8.1% from one year ago at 1.23 million. The limited availability equates to 3.4 months of supply, while a balanced and healthy market has six months.\nBut even a slide in mortgage rates \u2014 which has occurred recently in November \u2014 may not bring the expected relief for buyers.\n\"I think if interest rates drop, we're going to have so much demand on the sidelines that comes into the market,\" Lautz said. \"It could bid up home prices unless we have more housing inventory.\"\nRebecca Chen is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and previously worked as an investment tax certified public accountant (CPA).\nClick here for real estate and housing market news, reports, and analysis to inform your investing decisions.",

Projected debt service is 45% of the expected total revenue,\" Tinubu said while presenting his 27.5 trillion naira ($34.85 billion) expenditure plan for next year.\nSpending priorities include security, infrastructure and measures to ease a cost-of-living crisis.\nThe president said the economy was expected to grow by at least 3.76% next year while inflation would moderate to 21.4%.\nAnalysts said the government's revenue expectations looked ambitious and warned that there were downside risks to global prices of oil and production of crude, Nigeria's biggest export.\nThe government would also need to keep its promise to do away with the petrol subsidy and allow the market to determine the exchange rate.\n\"They are going to have to increase the price of petrol and allow the exchange rate to move. If not, it may be difficult to achieve that deficit figure,\" said Bismarck Rewane, managing director of Lagos-based Financial Derivatives Company.\nTinubu inherited an economy that is struggling with high debt levels, low revenue collections, widespread insecurity, including a long-running insurgency in the northeast and kidnappings for ransom in the northwest.

Morgan Private Bank. \"Disinflation is continuing at a rapid pace in Europe \u2013 and, importantly, more swiftly than the market or even the ECB's expectations.\"\n\"Falling inflation and a stagnant economy could justify ECB cuts as soon as the first quarter of next year in our view,\" Landon said.\nThe euro dropped as much as 0.5% against the dollar to $1.0910 and last stood at $1.0930. On Wednesday it hit its highest level since August at $1.1017.\nMarkets are now fully pricing in a rate cut from the ECB by April, while around 115 basis points of easing is priced by the end of next year.\nECB policymaker Fabio Panetta said on Thursday the central bank may be able to ease monetary conditions if persistently weak output accelerates the decline in inflation.\nMeanwhile, the dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six others including the euro, rose 0.4% to 103.25, picking up after touching 102.46 on Wednesday, its lowest level since Aug. 11.\nThe index is still down around 3.3% in November, its biggest monthly fall since last November, on growing expectations the Fed will also cut interest rates in the first half of 2024.\n\"The key drivers in November for the dollar weakness have been the benign inflation data and the loosening signs of the labour market,\" said Mohamad Al-Saraf, associate, FX and rates strategy at Danske Bank.\n\"The notion of a soft landing has increased and usually that's a bad environment for the dollar.\"\nInvestors will be all ears on Friday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell takes centre stage in the wake of Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Tuesday flagging a possible rate cut in the months ahead. It will also be the last time Fed policymakers will be able to share their views before they enter the quiet period before the December policy meeting.\nBefore that, the spotlight will firmly be on Thursday's crucial personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index - the Fed's targeted measure of inflation.\nChristopher Wong, currency strategist at OCBC, said the data will offer a glimpse into whether the disinflation trend seen so far remains intact.\n\"If core PCE undershoots expectations to the downside, then USD may extend the move lower again,\" he said.\nU.S. rates futures markets are now pricing in more than 100 bps of rate cuts next year starting in May, and the two-year Treasury yield is close to its lowest since July - it has slumped about 40 bps this week alone.\nMeanwhile, expectations that the Bank of Japan will soon end its negative rate policy have pulled the yen up from the depths, and in the process, eased pressure on the central bank to support the currency via direct FX market intervention.\nOn Thursday, the yen weakened 0.2% to 147.575 per dollar, but remains close to the two-and-a-half-month high of 146.675 per dollar it touched on Wednesday. The Japanese currency has firmed almost 3% against the dollar in November and is on course for its strongest month this year.\nBank of Japan board member Toyoaki Nakamura said on Thursday the central bank will likely need some more time before phasing out its massive stimulus.\nSterling was last at $1.2655, down 0.3% on the day, while the Australian dollar fell 0.2% to $0.6605. It's still up 4.2% in November - its steepest one-month gain in a year.\n(Reporting by Samuel Indyk in London and Ankur Banerjee and Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore; Editing by Susan Fenton, Kirsten Donovan)",

The redesign in 2023 makes it more pleasing to the eye, according to Car and Driver, while its reliability remains unmatched. iSeeCars.com gave it a greater than 27% chance of lasting more than 250,000 miles, which is more than three times the average passenger car.\nDiscover: 7 Sports Cars To Stay Away From Buying\nThe Toyota Corolla Hybrid holds the number one spot on the list of Consumer Reports most reliable vehicles, with a reliability rating of 93 and an overall score of 88.

You may not think of a stylish, two-seater sports car as a top pick for reliability, but it earned a score of 85 from Consumer Reports.\nAffordable, fun and fuel-efficient, the MX-5 isn\u2019t exactly a family car or even the best road trip vehicle due to the lack of trunk space. It may be reliable, but it\u2019s not 100% practical for most people.

After repeated requests, the prisoner hit Paul in the face, breaking Paul's glasses in the process, and attempted to hit him a second time,\" Dave Whelan said.\n\"Paul stood up to block the second hit and other prisoners intervened to prevent the prisoner continuing the attack on Paul.\"\nDave Whelan said the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon. He thought his brother was a target because he was an American and anti-American sentiment was \"not uncommon among the other prisoners,\" he said.\nPresident Vladimir Putin says Russia is locked in what he casts as an existential struggle for a new world order with the U.S.-led West, which he accuses of wanting to plunder his country's vast natural resources and to dismember it.\nThe Mordovia regional prison service confirmed to the Interfax news agency that the attack on Whelan had happened. It said guards had taken immediate action to stop \"the illegal actions.\"\nBoth men had been taken to the medical bay, where Whelan was found to have suffered an abrasion beneath one of his eyes, it was cited as saying.\nThere was CCTV footage of the incident and the prison service was looking into it further before submitting a report to the police, Interfax reported.\nIt quoted an unnamed person \"familiar with the situation\" as saying that Whelan had been struck by \"a convict from Turkey over political disagreements\".\nArrested in 2018 in Russia, Paul Whelan was convicted of espionage in 2020 and handed a 16-year sentence.\nWhelan and the U.S. government have denied he is a spy. Washington has designated him as \"wrongfully detained\" amid speculation that he and Evan Gershkovich, an American journalist accused of spying, will one day be freed as part of a prisoner exchange between the two countries.\nGershkovich, who on Tuesday had his pre-trial detention extended until the end of January, denies the spying charges he faces.

        "text": "\nBy Tommy Wilkes\nLONDON (Reuters) -Four major banks, including Standard Chartered Plc and HSBC Plc, have quit a United Nations-backed initiative to scrutinise climate targets set by corporations, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe lenders have abandoned efforts for the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to validate their goals because of concerns it could hinder their ability to continue financing fossil fuels, the sources said.\nSome of the banks, which also include Societe Generale SA and ABN Amro Bank NV, have also raised concerns that SBTi's greenhouse gas emissions target-setting demands are too hard to meet, the sources added.\nTo justify their departures, which happened separately and over the past year, some of the banks cited their membership of another United Nations-backed grouping, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which is less prescriptive and allows lenders to continue to finance fossil fuels as long as they make progress on their emissions. Many lenders say they should finance fossil fuels as long as economies depend on them.\nThe departure of the four banks casts a shadow over the world's most widely adopted standard for curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\nLaunched as a non-profit, SBTi has certified that emissions targets of nearly 4,000 companies globally are aligned with the intergovernmental Paris agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nSBTi unveiled plans this year for a new standard that will apply specifically to financial institutions as early as 2024. It will require banks and asset managers not to finance new fossil fuel projects.\nThis proved too much for Standard Chartered, which wants to continue this business in developing markets. A spokesperson for the bank confirmed it had left the validation process and said SBTi's proposed standard failed to consider adequately \"the transition (away from fossil fuels) of our clients and markets\".\nThe spokesperson added that Standard Chartered was seeking alternative third-party validation of its climate targets and that it was setting science-based targets through the NZBA.\nAn HSBC spokesperson said the bank was setting its emissions targets in line with NZBA guidance. A spokesperson for Societe Generale said the French bank was also committed to setting its emissions targets in line with NZBA's methodology.\nA spokesperson for ABN Amro said the Dutch lender remained an NZBA member after leaving SBTi.\nAn SBTi spokesperson told Reuters that, following feedback, SBTi changed some of its requirements. It will allow banks to continue to finance some fossil fuel projects as long as they pertain to emissions targets that have to be met near-term. It will still require them to cease the financing of fossil fuel projects that would weigh on their longer-term emissions targets.\n\"We cannot limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and mitigate the risks of climate breakdown without reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,\" SBTi said in a statement.\nTo be sure, most major European banks that signed up to SBTi remain members. Credit Agricole, ING, BBVA and Swedbank told Reuters they remained committed to SBTi validating their emissions targets.\nSBTi has already approved some NatWest, Commerzbank and Raiffeisen targets. BNP Paribas did not respond to requests for comment about its SBTi status.\nNo major U.S. bank has joined SBTi, opting instead for NZBA's easier-to-meet standards.\nCRACKS SPREADING\nIn a sign that cracks between SBTi and financial firms could spread, a spokesperson for Allianz said the German insurance giant had also quit, without providing a reason.\nThe spokesperson said Allianz was committed to the target-setting methodology of the Net-Zero Asset Owners Alliance, another U.N. backed climate coalition it is a member of. This year, Allianz quit the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance amid concerns that the climate coalition was at risk of violating antitrust law.\nIt is not the first time that banks have sought to lower the bar on the emissions they help finance. Reuters reported in July that lenders working to develop global standards on accounting for greenhouse gases in bond or stock sale underwriting voted to exclude most of these emissions from their own carbon footprint.\nPietro Rocco, head of green finance at the Carbon Trust, which advises firms on decarbonising, said he was concerned that leaving SBTi would lead to less ambitious emissions targets.\n\"They hold you to a higher standard than NZBA. SBTi shows you haven't gone off on your own, it's been marked,\" Rocco said.\n(Reporting by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes in LondonEditing by Simon Jessop and Josie Kao)",

X declined to comment and referred to a statement from CEO Linda Yaccarino posted Thursday.\n\"When it comes to this platform - X has also been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There's no place for it anywhere in the world - it's ugly and wrong. Full stop,\" said Yaccarino.\nOn Wednesday, after being questioned by another user about targeting all Jewish people, Musk attacked the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that works to fight antisemitism, who he has accused previously without evidence of being responsible for the drop in advertising on X.\nADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt responded on X that \u201cat a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one's influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories.\u201d\nAdvertisers have fled the site since Musk bought it and reduced content moderation that has resulted in a dramatic increase in hate speech on X, civil rights groups have said.\nReuters reported in October that monthly U.S. ad revenue at X has declined at least 55% year-over-year each month since Musk bought the company in October 2022, citing third-party data provided to Reuters.\nMusk is also CEO of electric carmaker Tesla, which has been hit by several lawsuits that allege rampant racial or sexual harassment of workers.\nAntisemitism has been on the rise in recent years in the United States and worldwide. Following the outbreak of war between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which attacked Israel on Oct. 7, antisemitic incidents in the United States rose by nearly 400% from the year-earlier period, the ADL said.\n(This story has been corrected to fix typo in paragraph 1)\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and David Gaffen in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The United States and China are the two global economic heavyweights. Combined, they produce more than 40% of the world's goods and services.\nSo when Washington and Beijing do economic battle, as they have for five years running, the rest of the world suffers, too. And when they hold a rare high-level summit, as Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping will this week, it can have global consequences.\nThe world's economy could benefit from a U.S.-China d\u00e9tente. Since 2020, it has suffered one crisis after another \u2014 the COVID-19 pandemic, soaring inflation, surging interest rates, violent conflicts in Ukraine and now Gaza. The global economy is expected to grow a lackluster 3% this year and 2.9% in 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\u201cHaving the world\u2019s two largest economies at loggerheads at such a fraught moment,\" said Eswar Prasad, senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University, \u201cexacerbates the negative impact of various geopolitical shocks that have hit the world economy.\u201d\nHopes have risen that Washington and Beijing can at least cool some of their economic tensions at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which started Sunday in San Francisco. The meeting will bring together 21 Pacific Rim countries, which collectively represent 40% of the world\u2019s people and nearly half of global trade.\nThe marquee event will be the Biden-Xi meeting Wednesday on the sidelines of the summit, the first time the two leaders will have spoken in a year, during which time frictions between the two nations have worsened. The White House has sought to tamp down expectations, saying to expect no breakthroughs.\nAt the same time, Prasad suggested that the threshold for declaring a successful outcome is relatively low. \u201cPreventing any further deterioration in the bilateral economic relationship,\" he said, \"would already be a victory for both sides.\u2019\u2019\nThe U.S.-China economic relationship had been deteriorating for years before it erupted in 2018, at the instigation of President Donald Trump, into an all-out trade war. The Trump administration charged that China had violated the commitments it made, in joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, to open its vast market to U.S. and other foreign companies that wanted to sell their goods and services there.\nIn 2018, the Trump administration began imposing tariffs on Chinese imports to punish Beijing for its actions in trying to supplant U.S. technological supremacy. Many experts agreed with the administration that Beijing had engaged in cyberespionage and had improperly demanded that foreign companies turn over trade secrets as the price of gaining access to the Chinese market. Beijing punched back against Trump's sanctions with its own retaliatory tariffs, making U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese buyers.\nWhen Biden took office in 2021, he kept much of Trump\u2019s confrontational trade policy, including the China tariffs. The U.S. tax rate on Chinese imports now exceeds 19%, versus 3% at the start of 2018, before Trump imposed his tariffs. Likewise, Chinese import taxes on U.S. goods are up to 21%, from 8% before the trade war began, according to calculations by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nOne of the tenets of Biden's economic policy has been to reduce America\u2019s economic reliance on Chinese factories, which came under strain when COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains, and to solidify partnerships with other Asian nations. As part of that policy, the Biden administration last year forged the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity with 14 countries.\nIn some ways, U.S.-China trade tensions are even higher under Biden than they were under Trump. Beijing is seething over the Biden administration\u2019s decision to impose \u2014 and then broaden \u2014 export controls that are designed to prevent China from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. In August, Beijing countered with its own trade curbs: It began requiring that Chinese exporters of gallium and germanium, metals used in computer chips and solar cells, obtain government licenses to send those metals overseas.\nBeijing has also taken aggressive actions against foreign companies in China. Orchestrating what appears to be a counterespionage campaign, its authorities this year raided the Chinese offices of the U.S. consulting firms Capvision and the Mintz Group, questioned Shanghai employees of the Bain & Co. consultancy and announced a security review of the chipmaker Micron.\nSome analysts speak of a \u201cdecoupling\u2019\u2019 of the world\u2019s two biggest economies after decades in which they relied deeply on each other for trade. Indeed, imports of Chinese goods to the United States were down 24% through September compared with the same period of 2022.\nThe rift between Beijing and Washington has forced many other countries into a delicate predicament: Deciding which side they're on when they actually want to do business with both countries.\nThe IMF says such economic \u201cfragmentation\u2019\u2019 is damaging to the world. The 190-country lending agency estimates that higher trade barriers will subtract $7.4 trillion from global economic output after the world has adjusted to the higher trade barriers.\nAnd those barriers are rising: Last year, the IMF said, countries imposed nearly 3,000 new restrictions on trade, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2019. The agency foresees international trade growing just 0.9% this year and 3.5% in 2024 \u2014 down sharply from the 2000-2019 annual average of 4.9%.\nThe Biden administration insists it isn\u2019t trying to undermine China's economy. On Friday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with her Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, in San Francisco and sought to set the stage for Biden-Xi summit.\n\u201cOur mutual desire \u2014 both China and the United States \u2014 is to create a level playing field and ongoing, meaningful and mutually beneficial economic relations,\u201d Yellen said.\nXi, too, has reason to try to restore economic cooperation with the United States. The Chinese economy is under heavy strain. Its real estate market has collapsed, youth unemployment is rampant and consumer spirits are low. The raids on foreign businesses have spooked international companies and investors.\n\u201cWith serious headwinds facing the Chinese economy and many U.S. firms packing up their bags and leaving China, Xi needs to convince investors that China is still a profitable place to conduct business,\u2019\u2019 said Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Institute and a former U.S. trade negotiator. \u201cThis will not be an easy sell.\u2019\u2019\nComplicating matters is that the tensions between Washington and Beijing go well beyond economics. Under Xi, the Chinese Communist Party has punished dissent in Hong Kong and the autonomous Muslim region of Xinjiang. His government made aggressive territorial demands in Asia, engaging in deadly border clashes with India and bullying the Philippines and other neighbors in parts of the South China Sea it claims as its own. It has increasingly threatened Taiwan, which it considers a renegade Chinese province.\nU.S.-China tensions could intensify next year with presidential elections in Taiwan and the United States, where criticism of Beijing is among the few areas that unite Democrats and Republicans.\nXi\u2019s policies appear to be costing China in the battle for world opinion. In a recent survey of people in 24 countries, the Pew Research Center reported that the United States was viewed more favorably than China in all but two (Kenya and Nigeria) nations.\nCould China change course?\nSpeaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat who serves on a House committee that monitors China, noted optimistically that Xi has reversed himself before \u2014 notably in declaring a sudden end to the draconian zero-COVID policies that crippled China's economy last year.\n\u201cWe have to give that possibility a chance, even at the same time that we hedge and protect our interests,\u2019\u2019 Krishnamoorthi said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping we also see come out of this meeting.\u2019\u2019",

On Wednesday it hit its highest level since August at $1.1017.\nMeanwhile, expectations that the Bank of Japan will soon end its negative rate policy have pulled the yen up from the depths, and in the process, eased pressure on the central bank to support the currency via direct FX market intervention.\nOn Thursday, the yen strengthened 0.07% to 147.085 per dollar, remaining close to the two-and-a-half-month high of 146.675 per dollar it touched on Wednesday. The Asian currency has firmed 3% against the dollar in November and is on course for its strongest month this year.\nBank of Japan board member Toyoaki Nakamura said on Thursday the central bank will likely need some more time before phasing out its massive stimulus.\nSterling was last at $1.2664, down 0.25% on the day, while the Australian dollar rose 0.08% to $0.6622 and is up 4.5% in November - its steepest one-month gain in a year.\n(Reporting by Samuel Indyk in London and Ankur Banerjee and Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore; Editing by Kim Coghill and Miral Fahmy)",

        "text": "\nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u2014 Anthony Albanese will become the first Australian prime minister in seven years to visit China in recognition that bilateral relations have improved after crashing to unprecedented depths over trade and security differences that remain largely unresolved.\nThe 2022 election of Albanese\u2019s center-left government after nine years of conservative rule created an opportunity for a reset. He arrives Saturday on a three-day visit that will take him to Shanghai then Beijing, where he'll meet with President Xi Jinping.\nXi had two meetings in six months with an Australian prime minister in 2016, but China severed top-level ministerial contacts with Australia after that. Official and unofficial trade sanctions stacked up since 2020 to cost Australian exporters up to 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year for commodities including coal, wine, beef, barley and lobsters.\nMany say the trade boycott hurt an economically troubled China while Australia showed no signs of bending to Beijing\u2019s coercion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in Australia\u2019s interest to have good relations with China,\u201d Albanese told reporters in October, when he announced the trip.\nBut Albanese\u2019s government is also deepening security ties with the United States, notably with the AUKUS agreement involving Britain that will provide Australia with a fleet of submarines powered by U.S. nuclear technology.\nNo significant announcements are expected during Albanese\u2019s largely symbolic visit, which comes close to the 50th anniversary of the first trip by an Australian prime minister to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nAlbanese is expected to attend the Sunday opening of the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, and has scheduled meetings in Beijing with Xi on Monday and Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday.\nThe Chinese leaders' discussions with Albanese would cover bilateral relations and international and regional issues, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Friday. \"A healthy and stable relationship is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples, and is conducive to regional and world peace and stability,\u201d Wang said.\nHe said China would use the visit to work with Australia to expand cooperation \u201cin the spirit of mutual respect, mutual benefit and seeking common ground while reserving differences.\u201d\nShi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Beijing\u2019s Renmin University of China, said the Chinese wanted to improve trade relations after a \u201clargely ineffective de facto boycott.\u201d\nBut Shi noted that not all the trade barriers had been lifted, although Australia is confident that steep tariffs on wine will be removed within months. The wine trade was worth AU$1.2 billion ($771 million) a year.\nAustralia's first serious mistakes in Chinese eyes came in 2018 with moves that were seen as emphasizing China as a security threat.\nThe Australian Parliament passed national security legislation that banned covert foreign interference in domestic politics and made industrial espionage for a foreign power a crime. Two months later, the government banned Chinese-owned telecommunications giant Huawei from rolling out its 5G network in Australia due to unspecified security concerns.\nThe Chinese trade barriers followed the Australian government's demands for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 and China\u2019s responses to the pandemic. China has accused Australia, the U.S. and others of politicizing the issue.\nAlbanese maintains he has made no concessions to China to achieve more stable relations, citing the October release of Australian journalist Cheng Lei, who was detained in China for three years in a case concerning state secrets.\nBut just before his planned trip was announced, Albanese\u2019s government said it would not cancel a Chinese company\u2019s 99-year lease on Darwin Port despite U.S. concerns that foreign control could be used to spy on its military forces. Albanese had criticized the lease since it was signed in 2015, and some security analysts interpreted the decision to let Shandong Landbridge Group keep the lease as a concession to China ahead of his visit.\nAustralia is trying to find the right balance between security concerns and the need to have a peaceful region and productive economic ties with China, said Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nBlanchette said the growing talk of \u201cde-risking\u201d in Australia, or not depending too heavily on one country economically, is likely to be a concern for China in the talks.\nAustralia\u2019s efforts to diversify trade away from China, its largest trading partner, have struck obstacles.\nAustralian Trade Minister Don Farrell announced Monday that negotiations on a free trade deal with the European Union had collapsed despite Europe\u2019s eagerness to reduce its own dependency on China. Still, Farrell expects the cost of what his government euphemistically calls \u201ctrade impediments\u201d with China will soon diminish from a peak of AU$20 billion ($13 billion) a year to AU$1 billion ($643 million).\nDespite the years of political upheaval between Beijing and Canberra, the value of Australian goods and services exported to China more than doubled, said James Laurenceson, director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.\nAustralian government data valued annual exports for the year to August at AU$194 billion ($125 billion). In 2016, that figure for the same period was AU$96 billion ($71 billion at the time).\nWang Yiwei, a Renmin University international relations professor, said China wanted stable diplomatic relations with Australia to underpin economic relations.\n\u201cChina still hopes that there will be a proper distinction between security and economy,\u201d Wang said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Christopher Bodeen in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.\n___\nFind more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",

        "text": "\nBy Casey Hall\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - The decision by McDonald's to take greater control of its China business and expand aggressively in the face of a consumer slowdown and geopolitical tensions seems risky - but the potential pay-off is great, analysts say. Last month, the U.S.-based burger maker cut a deal to repurchase the 28% stake in its China business Carlyle Group took in 2017, giving it a 48% share in $6 billion worth of operations that include Hong Kong and Macau. The move contrasts sharply with the prevailing trend of multinational corporations reeling back investments in China or even exiting altogether because of geopolitical and economic challenges.\nOne advantage for McDonald\u2019s: its majority partner in the China business, CITIC, provides top-level political cover, said Jason Yu, greater China managing director of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. \"Having a very powerful Chinese state-owned conglomerate as a partner means they are not going to be at the forefront of the geopolitical situation; that is quite important,\" Yu said.\nMcDonald's China, Carlyle Group and CITIC declined to comment.\nOther consumer-facing U.S. firms, including Starbucks, Apple, Coach owner Tapestry and sportswear giant Nike, have remained similarly dedicated to the China market.\nStarbucks and Nike, which face increased competition from lower-priced domestic competitors, show the need to stay agile in order to protect and grow market share, analysts say.\nThe coffee giant is sticking with expansion plans and launched a smaller cup size; Nike, by contrast, has offered localised, higher-end sneakers such as its \"Year of the Rabbit\" Dunk Lows.\nMcDonald\u2019s has used funds from the Carlyle investment to double its restaurant count since 2017 to 5,500, and the country has become its second-largest market. The business aims to have more than 10,000 stores in China by 2028. Competitors of McDonald's are also expanding their reach in China. Yum China, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut, among other brands, already has more than 14,000 stores across the country. Among domestic players, chicken burger specialist Wallace said in 2021 that it had reached 20,000 stores, and newer entrant Tastien, which specialises in \"Chinese-style\" burgers, has more than 3,500 stores.\nTo be sure, if relations between China and the West worsen, any optimism could evaporate, said Greg Halter, Director of Research at investment advisory firm Carnegie Investment Counsel.\n\"If tensions deteriorate, we may see not only McDonald's, but other companies divest their Chinese operations, similar to what has occurred in Russia over the past two years,\" Halter said.\nFurther digitalisation and localisation are needed, Yu said, with localisation key to winning over taste buds in China's $140.2 billion limited-service restaurant sector.\nAlthough the McDonald's China menu would be familiar to U.S. consumers, there are nods to local tastes, including taro pie, rather than apple.\nAccording to Euromonitor, the market value of limited-service restaurants in China is on track to grow about 4% annually on average through 2025. Of the limited-service burger-focussed restaurants in the country, McDonald's dominates with a 70% share of the market.\nChina's slowing economic growth and lacklustre consumer spending this year have already hurt the bottom lines of global businesses exposed to its consumer market, but McDonald's is well-placed to outperform, said Ben Cavender, the Shanghai-based managing director and head of strategy at China Market Research Group.\nHe said value-driven middle class consumers and lower commercial rents countrywide should be a boon to such businesses. \"If ever there was a time to double down on China, this is it,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Casey Hall in Shanghai and Kane Wu in Hong Kong; additional reporting from Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru.

According to The Motley Fool, Costco sells a bottle of its Cabernet for $9.99, but prices vary by location.\nAnother highly rated beverage is the Kirkland label vodka, and SheKnows claims that there are rumors that it\u2019s Grey Goose in disguise. Both are sourced from France\u2019s Cognac region, but Costco\u2019s version will only set you back $20.\nCostco sells huge filets of salmon that can be divided into several servings, according to Business Insider.

The salmon is also skinless and boneless, noted The Kitchn, and prices are typically around $12.99 per pound.\nAlso: 10 Costco Meals That Are Cheaper Than Buying Takeout\nOrganic raw honey can be expensive, but Costco sells high-quality honey at a great price under its Kirkland Signature brand.

When Costco announced its sheet cake would be discontinued in May 2020, thousands of angry customers signed petitions and left angry comments on the retailer\u2019s Facebook page, Cheapism reported.

        "text": "\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Mexico\u2019s government issued a decree Monday that will force private freight railway lines to give preference to passenger train service over their normal freight runs.\nThe decree gives the two main private concessionary rail operators until Jan. 15 to present proposals for offering the passenger service themselves. If they decline, the government will put the army or the navy, which have no experience operating railways, in charge of the services.\nAlmost all of Mexican railway traffic currently carries freight except for minor tourist train services like northern Mexico\u2019s Copper Canyon and the western tequila-producing region around Jalisco.\nThe government wants four short inter-city routes where passenger trains would run on tracks normally used only for freight.\nBut the biggest challenge could be three long passenger routes the government also wants to establish from central Mexico to the U.S. border: the 700-mile (1,120-kilometer) proposed passenger service from Mexico City to Nuevo Laredo, the 900-mile (1,450-kilometer) run from Aguascalientes to the border city of Ciudad Juarez, and the 1,350-mile (2,180-kilometer) route from the capital to the border city of Nogales.\nThe decree combines two interests of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador: his nostalgia for passenger train services that ran in Mexico before private concessionary operators were allowed in, and his reliance on the military for everything from law enforcement to building projects.\nThe two main private operators in Mexico are the multinational Canadian Pacific Kansas City, known as CPKS, and Mexico's Ferromex. Both operate freight services.\nFew passenger train systems in the world are profitable. Most rely heavily on government subsidies. The decree contains no mention of whether the private companies would be offered subsidies.\nMexico's army is building the Tren Maya tourist railroad on the Yucatan peninsula, and the Navy is in charge of the revamped trans-Isthmus railway connecting the Gulf of Mexico to Pacific ports. But neither is fully operational.\nIn the decree, the president's office wrote that \u201cpreference will be given to public passenger rail service, and freight rail transport will be respected, according to the terms of the corresponding concession.\u201d\nThat raises the potential for delays. When the government last provided passenger service through a state-owned company in the 1990s, trains seldom ran on time.\nFerromex hasn't commented. In a statement over the weekend, CPKS wrote that it doesn\u2019t expect problems, as long as the Mexican government lives up to its pledge not to allow the proposed passenger services to disturb freight runs.\n\u201cThe draft decree emphasizes that the public freight rail service will be respected and as such, we do not expect an adverse impact on our concession,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cCPKC has extensive experience hosting passenger rail services in multiple locations across its network in the United States and Canada while efficiently managing freight service.\u201d\nThe company said its Mexican subsidiary, CPKS de Mexico \u201chas previously reached an agreement with the Mexican Federal Government to perform a study of what is required for the proposed new passenger rail service on the right of way of the corridor between Mexico City and Quer\u00e9taro.\u201d\nThe government also wants to establish passenger service from Mexico City to the north-central city of San Luis Potos\u00ed, through Monterrey and on to the Texas border city of Laredo. CPKS said that \u201cas required by our concession, CPKC de M\u00e9xico will work closely with the Mexican Federal Government to evaluate passenger service on that corridor.\u201d\nThe government also wants to run passenger trains from Mexico City to the Gulf port city of Coatzacoalcos, from the capital to the nearby cities of Queretaro and Aguascalientes, and a short run from the new Mexico City airport to the nearby city of Pachuca.\nThe plans also include connecting the Pacific coast port of Manzanillo with the cities of Guadalajara and Irapuato. Manzanillo is mainly known as a freight port and has relatively little tourist infrastructure.\nBecause rail lines are currently designed for and operated as a slower-moving freight services, and are often full of trains and at-grade crossings, the passenger trains may not move very fast. When long passenger runs were offered in the 1990s, they sometimes took days to reach their destination.",

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Three Americans held by Hamas in Gaza since its attack on Israel last month are expected to be among at least 50 hostages to be released by the Islamist Palestinian group under a deal arranged with Israel, the U.S. and Qatar, a senior U.S. official said.\nThe three include a 3-year-old girl whose parents were among the more than 1,200 people killed in Hamas' initial Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, the official said. Israeli bombardments since have flattened large swaths of Hamas-led Gaza and killed 13,300 civilians, according to authorities in Gaza.\nThe official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said it was likely that more than 50 hostages, largely women and children, will be released once a pause in fighting takes hold.\nUnder terms of the deal, Hamas is to release 50 hostages and Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners during a four- to five-day pause in the fighting.\nThe hostage group will include two American women and an American girl named Abigail who will turn four on Friday, the official said.\nInitial releases of hostages are expected within 24 hours of the deal's announcement, with the first likely to be freed Thursday morning, the official said.\n\"I would say it's at least 50 of the women and children over a period of four to five days,\" the official said, without providing details of any other nationalities expected to be released.\nThe deal will also include more deliveries of humanitarian relief aid to Gaza, the official said. Officials hope the pause will be observed in northern Israel where there have been clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces.\nA rigorous inspection regime will ensure Hamas does not use the pause to rearm the group's fighters in Gaza with weaponry, the official said.\nHamas has said \"they actually need a pause to locate and determine where people are,\" the official said. The pause will give Hamas time to identify and collect additional women and children, the official said.\n\"We do anticipate it will be more than 50, but I just don't want to put a number on it,\" the official said. \"But the way the deal is structured is it very much incentivizes the release of everybody.\" (Reporting By Steve Holland, Costas Pitas, Humeyra Pamuk and Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Scott Malone and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "text": "\nFollowing the ouster of CEO Sam Altman, the future of OpenAI is in question and the ultimate repercussions unclear. With a majority of OpenAI employees poised to jump ship and follow Altman to Microsoft, the startup that brought the world ChatGPT looks like an empty shell, and a deal for insiders to cash out equity at an $86 billion valuation is effectively dead on arrival.\nBut there\u2019s one clear winner. Microsoft has added $63 billion to its market capitalization since Friday\u2019s close, according to Fortune\u2019s calculations. The company\u2019s stock reached $378 per share in midday trading on Monday, an all-time high. If that price holds by Monday's market close, Microsoft's market cap, based on its 7.429 billion shares outstanding, will total $2.82 trillion.\nIt\u2019s a remarkable turn of events for Microsoft and CEO Satya Nadella, who could easily have been the biggest losers in the affair. Microsoft has pumped $13 billion into the startup and has made OpenAI\u2019s technology a cornerstone of its product lineup, weaving it into everything from Office365 to GitHub.\nThe Friday statement by OpenAI\u2019s board, firing Altman because \u201che was not consistently candid in his communications,\u201d was a direct threat to Nadella\u2019s strategy. Indeed, within minutes of the announcement going public on Friday afternoon, Microsoft\u2019s stock took a nearly 2% hit, falling from $373 to $367 per share\u2014representing a notable loss for a company with a market cap approaching $3 trillion.\n\u201cIf Microsoft lost Altman he could have gone to Amazon, Google, Apple, or a host of other tech companies craving to get the face of AI globally in their doors,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors on Monday.\nBut Nadella\u2019s clutch reaction under pressure, announcing at midnight on Sunday that he had hired Altman and former OpenAI President Greg Brockman to lead a new AI research lab inside Microsoft, was a \"World Series of Poker move for the ages,\u201d Ives said.\nOr, as Macquarie Equity Research analysts succinctly put it in the title of their note to Microsoft investors: \"When you come at the king you best not miss.\u201d\nMicrosoft will now employ two of OpenAI\u2019s most influential workers and retain its massive stake in the startup. OpenAI, for its part, appointed former Twitch boss Emmett Shear as interim CEO. It is unclear what Microsoft\u2019s new research team will look like, but the hiring was certainly a powermove on Nadella\u2019s part.\n\u201cWe look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success,\u201d Nadella said in the post, suggesting Microsoft might be willing to hire Altman-loyalists who defect from OpenAI. \u201cWe look forward to getting to know Emmett Shear and OAI's new leadership team and working with them,\u201d he added.\nAltman responded on X, \u201cthe mission continues.\u201d\nWhile the stock pop is sure to please Microsoft leadership, it isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows ahead. The company is now responsible for building (and fielding costs for) the new AI research organization under Altman and Brockman. And it may still have to pay billions in existing contracts to a fledgling company, as Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell reported.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Traders added to bets on a March 2024 start to Fed rate cuts after Chair Jerome Powell said in closely watched remarks that rate hikes were achieving what was hoped, though he vowed to move \"carefully.\" MSCI's index tracking Latin American equities gained 1.3% in afternoon trading, after notching its best month since 2020 in November on hopes that U.S. interest rates have peaked. A basket of regional currencies strengthened 1% as the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields fell. Both indexes were set for weekly gains, with the stocks index up 1% and currencies edging up 0.4%. More broadly, Bank of America analysts said that emerging market fixed income assets saw outflows of $59 million, in its 18th straight week, while stocks saw outflows of $1.2 billion, its eighth straight week of losses. Meanwhile, the real reversed earlier losses and gained 0.9% after Brazilian central bank director Diogo Guillen said current pace of 50-basis-point rate cuts per meeting will remain in place for the next few meetings. Separately, data showed industrial production rose by a less-than-expected 0.1% in October, pointing to a sluggish start to the fourth quarter. \"Today's numbers serve as a reminder that risks are still biased to the downside and that the COPOM (central bank) will have to accelerate the pace of monetary easing, assuming fiscal and external conditions remain benign,\" said Andres Abadia, chief Latin America economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Brazil's Bovespa reversed earlier losses, rising 0.5%. Shares of state-owned oil firm Petrobras slipped 0.5% after the company's chief executive said Brazil is expected to join the OPEC+ group of oil-producing countries in January but would not take part in the group's coordinated output caps. Mexico's benchmark index shed 0.4% after the country's president said the minimum wage will rise 20% next year, which analysts said would add to inflationary pressures. Still, a sharp rally in Mexican shares and optimism around companies moving to the Latin American country to be closer to the U.S. have spurred buying into exchange-traded funds (ETF) focused on local stocks, with iShares MSCI Mexico ETF posting its strongest month of inflows in seven years. Chile's peso strengthened nearly 2% after the IMACEC economic activity index rose 0.3% in October. Argentina's Merval index gained 6.8%, but was on track for weekly losses of 5.4% after jumping over 42% the week prior.

But there has been a mounting international outcry over the toll from the bombing and calls for a \"humanitarian pause\" to allow aid to reach Gaza civilians.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that Israel must use every means possible to distinguish between Palestinian civilians and Hamas militants in Gaza, and he also urged Netanyahu to \"rein in\" extremist Jewish settler violence against innocent people in the occupied West Bank.\nPope Francis on Sunday called for a ceasefire and renewed his call for the release of all hostages.\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron expressed their concern about getting aid into Gaza during a phone call on Sunday, Sunak's office said.\nSHORTAGES\nWith supplies of food, water and medicines running low and much of Gaza reduced to rubble, thousands of residents broke into warehouses and distribution centres of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) grabbing flour and \"basic survival items\", the organisation said on Sunday.\nIsrael will allow a dramatic increase in aid to Gaza in the coming days and Palestinian civilians should head to a \"humanitarian zone\" in the south of the tiny territory, said Colonel Elad Goren of Cogat, the Israeli Defence Ministry agency that coordinates with the Palestinians.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said on Sunday 10 Egyptian trucks carrying food and medicine had arrived in Gaza via the Rafah crossing, bringing the total number so far to 94, a small fraction of what is needed.\nDisplaced Palestinians staying in tents in Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis described dire living conditions, with little access to food and water and having to queue hours for the toilet.\n\"I wish God will have mercy on us and the war stops,\" said Rami Al-Erqan, a father cradling his daughter, one of his six children. \"We reached a state where we wish to have died under the rubble just to find some rest. Our life is torture.\"\nCentral Israel also came under heavy rocket fire on Sunday, with sirens sounding in several major cities.\nAl-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said on its Telegram account that it was \"bombing Tel Aviv in response to the Zionist massacres against civilians\".\nThey later said their fighters had clashed with Israeli forces northwest of Gaza and had also set fire to two Israeli tanks. There was no immediate word from Israel on the claims.\nNetanyahu warned Israelis on Saturday to expect a \"long and hard\" campaign but stopped short of calling the current incursions in Gaza an invasion. Some of U.S. President Joe Biden's aides have advised Israeli counterparts to hold off on an immediate all-out assault, U.S. officials say.\nNetanyahu also pledged to spare no effort to free the more than 200 hostages, including foreigners, held by Hamas.\nPROTESTS\nThe conflict has prompted large demonstrations worldwide in support of the Palestinians. On Sunday several thousand people rallied in Beirut to show solidarity with Gaza.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received warnings from Israeli authorities to immediately evacuate al-Quds hospital in the Gaza Strip, adding that raids conducted on Sunday had taken place just 50 metres from the facility.\nThe Red Crescent says some 14,000 people have sought shelter at the hospital from Israeli air strikes.\nIsrael has accused Hamas of locating command centres and other military infrastructure in Gaza hospitals, something the group denies.\nPalestinian officials said around 50,000 people had also taken shelter in the Gaza Shifa Hospital and said they were concerned about ongoing Israeli threats to the facility.\nIsrael sent troops and tanks into Gaza on Friday night, focusing on infrastructure including the extensive tunnel network built by Hamas. The military provided no details on the size of the deployment.\nIsrael's chief military spokesperson declined to say whether Israel had been behind the telecommunications blackout but said it would do what it needed to protect its forces.\n(Reporting by James Mackenzie, Nidal al-Mughrabi; Additional reporting by Emily Rose, Riham Alkousaa, Omar Abdel-Razek, Ari Rabinovitch, Adam Makary, Ali Swafta, John Davison, Michelle Nichols; Writing by Gareth Jones; Editing by Alison Williams)",

Spending is, however, seen cooling off in early 2024 as excess savings accumulated during the pandemic start running out, leaving economists convinced the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates.\nBut risks of a rate hike remain.\n\"U.S. consumers still had some gas left in the tank last month that risks carrying into the current quarter,\" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.\n\"While we still expect spending and the economy to downshift sharply in the fourth quarter, the risk is that both will keep running hotter than the Fed needs to subdue still-stubborn services inflation.\"\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, accelerated 0.7% last month after an unrevised 0.4% rise in August, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast spending gaining 0.5%.\nThe increase in spending was spread across goods and services. Outlays on goods increased 0.7%, led by prescription medication, new light trucks, food and beverages as well as recreational goods and vehicles. Spending on services shot up 0.8%, boosted by international travel, housing and utilities, healthcare and airline transportation services.\nThe data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the third quarter published on Thursday, which showed consumer spending accelerating sharply, contributing to the fastest pace of economic growth in nearly two years.\nAdjusting for inflation, consumer spending rose a solid 0.4% in September after ticking up 0.1% in August, a strong hand-off from the April-June quarter that bodes well for consumption and overall economic growth in the fourth quarter.\nGrowth, however, is unlikely to match last quarter's blockbuster performance. Consumer tapped their savings and put away less money with the saving rate dropping to 3.4% from 4.0% in August.\nPersonal income rose 0.3% after gaining 0.4% in August. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation and taxes dropped for a third straight month.\n\"That is not sustainable,\" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. \"Savings are finite and are being exhausted at a rapid rate, with various estimates suggesting that excess savings accrued during the pandemic could be exhausted in the first half of next year.\"\nExcess savings are mostly concentrated among high-income households, according to economists, with low-income households believed to have long depleted their stash. Most people are turning on debt to fund purchases. Some of these people likely have student loans on which they resumed repayment this month, which could out them in a precarious financial position.\nBut not every economist sees rising credit card balances as a threat, arguing that consumers are still able to meet their debt obligations, thanks to a strong labor market. Wages increased 0.4% after advancing 0.5% in the prior month.\n\"U.S. households are healthy financially relative to past cycles,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. \"Debt levels are low, savings are still pretty high and income is solid. There is nothing compelling in the data suggesting a spending slowdown is inevitable.\"\nStocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.\nWARMER MONTHLY INFLATION\nMonthly inflation remained warm in September. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 0.4% after increasing by the same margin in August. Food prices climbed 0.3% and energy prices increased 1.7%.\nIn the 12 months through September, the PCE price index advanced 3.4%, matching August's rise.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.3%, after edging up 0.1% in August. The cost of housing services increased 0.5%.\nMonthly inflation readings of 0.2% on a sustainable basis are needed to bring inflation back to the U.S. central bank's 2% target, according to economists. The so-called core PCE price index rose 3.7% on a year-on-year basis in September, the smallest gain since May 2021, after increasing 3.8% in August.\nStripping out housing, the core PCE price index rose by a mild 0.2%. The so-called super core, which is PCE services excluding energy and housing was stronger, increasing 0.4% after nudging up 0.1% in August. The super core PCE price index advanced 4.3% year-on-year in September.\nThe Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for monetary policy. Policymakers are watching the super core PCE price index to try and gauge their progress in combating inflation. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged next Wednesday as a recent surge in U.S. Treasury yields and stock market sell-off have tightened financial conditions.\nSince March 2022, the Fed has raised its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range.\n\"There is more work to be done to sustainably lower inflation towards the 2% target,\" said Pooja Sriram, an economist at Barclays in New York.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Dinner with Barack Obama, mansions on both US coasts and dazzling modern art collections \u2014 from Frank Stella to Jean-Michel Basquiat. These are all solid bragging points when you\u2019re sitting at finance\u2019s top table.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTesla\u2019s Cheapest Cybertruck Will Cost $60,990 and Be Available in 2025\nBanking Escapees Make Billions From Private Credit Boom\nIsrael Says Hamas Violated Terms of Cease-Fire as Truce Lapses\nThese Are the World's Most Expensive Cities to Live In Right Now\nSaudi Arabia Offers Iran Investment to Blunt Gaza War\nAnd yet for the three core founders of HPS Investment Partners, how they spend their fortune is much less striking than how they made it. In 2016 the private credit firm bought itself out of JPMorgan Chase & Co. in a complicated deal valuing it at close to $1 billion. As it wrestles today with the idea of a public listing, it could be worth roughly eight times as much.\nPerhaps more than anyone else, the usually secretive HPS has come to personify the remarkable rise of private credit as a usurper of traditional Wall Street lending. And the founding trio has the billions to prove it.\nFor more than a decade Scott Kapnick, Scot French and Mike Patterson have been at the vanguard of turning a niche area of finance \u2014 where \u201cnonbank\u201d funds lend money to riskier companies \u2014 into a $1.6 trillion juggernaut.\nThat all three worked before at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., another grand name of investment banking, adds a layer of spice to their story. HPS, like its fellow direct lenders, is now busy cutting off former Wall Street comrades from one of their favorite historic money spinners: corporate loans.\nA 64-year-old Midwesterner, Kapnick is usually understated. But he doesn\u2019t hold back when predicting private capital\u2019s overthrow of the financial order. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the rebuilding of Western capital markets beyond the banking system,\u201d the HPS chief executive officer tells Bloomberg in a rare interview.\nWhether that\u2019s a good thing depends on who you ask. Private credit\u2019s fans say stripping risky loans from the balance sheets of systemically important banks and shifting them to specialist lenders will strengthen the finance system.\nBut some, such as the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England, question whether a \u201cshadow banking\u201d network out of the public market\u2019s gaze creates its own dangers of weak transparency and illiquidity. Colm Kelleher, UBS Group AG\u2019s chairman, warned this week of a private credit \u201casset bubble.\u201d\nDespite its meteoric rise, outsiders know little about how HPS operates and how it quietly amassed $100 billion of investor assets. This story, the first account of its climb to its lofty peak, is based on interviews with more than a dozen people, including former and current employees and senior rivals. Many asked to remain anonymous discussing the intensely private firm and only a few agreed to talk about its ownership structure and financial information.\nHow Private Credit Gives Banks a Run for Their Money: QuickTake\nGoldman Genesis\nIronically, it was the zeal of post-financial crisis regulators that created the conditions for the evolution of firms like HPS. Frustrated by the crackdown on \u201ccasino\u201d banking after Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse, many of the finance world\u2019s animal spirits were left scrambling to find a place that still hungered for big, buccaneering bets. In short, the Wall Street of old.\nIn recent years banks have tended \u201cto gravitate toward businesses where they\u2019re getting fees and not taking investment risks,\u201d says Patterson, 48, an ex-Navy officer who graduated from Harvard and Stanford. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s not Wall Street 30 years ago, but it\u2019s the Wall Street of today.\u201d\nAs banks have retreated from risky lending, direct lenders have marched in. HPS and its ilk make loans with cash they\u2019ve raised from professional investors such as insurers, pensions and wealthy individuals, unlike banks which use ordinary customer deposits. That difference has kept the industry out of the crosshairs of regulators \u2014 until now, at least \u2014 allowing it to boom unhindered.\nKapnick and his cohort got in early. It was in 2007, a year before Lehman\u2019s implosion, that HPS\u2019 founders grabbed the chance to go their own way.\nThe HPS boss had been cohead of global investment banking at Goldman Sachs, where he\u2019d witnessed firsthand the genesis of one of private credit\u2019s earliest iterations: mezzanine finance. This type of loan sits between equity and more senior forms of debt in a company\u2019s capital structure, putting the lender toward the back of the queue on getting their money back if a borrower goes bust. Returns are better than bog-standard debt. The risks are greater.\nOne feature of the Goldman Sachs mezzanine franchise was that it raised money from outside investors to fund the loans, a blueprint for how private credit firms work today. The business was created by Muneer Satter, a Chicago native like Kapnick who remains close to the HPS boss.\nKapnick, a Goldman Sachs partner since 1994, noticed that the bank\u2019s nearest rival JPMorgan didn\u2019t have a competing mezzanine business. So in 2007 he jumped ship to build one as a unit of Highbridge Capital Management, an investment firm that sits within JPMorgan Asset Management. Others, including the now governing partners French, Patterson, Purnima Puri and Faith Rosenfeld, joined him. HPS was born.\n\u201cI had experience with Goldman and how they were originating and investing within the bank,\u201d says Kapnick. \u201cThere was space under JPMorgan where they could grow a similar franchise.\u201d\nThe University of Chicago alum had built before. A polished figure with a fondness for big-picture thinking, he cut his teeth creating the Goldman Sachs franchise in Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He\u2019s from finance stock, too. His father Harvey Kapnick led Arthur Andersen in the 1970s, leaving after he raised concerns about the closeness of its accounting and consultancy arms, a central aspect of the subsequent Enron scandal and Andersen\u2019s demise.\nIn the beginning, being perched within Highbridge and JPMorgan suited Kapnick and his team, giving them a leg-up over rivals. HPS (the acronym stands for Highbridge Principal Strategies) had access to a crew of JPMorgan salespeople to pitch clients, and to the Wall Street titan\u2019s capital.\nWhile the tie-up went well at first, the Lehman aftershocks kept rippling into the next decade, and regulators kept turning the screws on banks. \u201cJPMorgan was going to provide us with capital and the possibility of deal flow, including allowing me to fund a young, talented team,\u201d Kapnick recalls. \u201cAll these conditions were matched, but then the crisis happened and several of those conditions changed. It was difficult to see us grow as significantly.\u201d\nIn 2016 Kapnick and the rest of the senior team decided to part ways with the bank. A deal was done using about $300 million of debt financing from Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan and about $100 million of the partners\u2019 cash.\nJPMorgan kept an HPS stake and agreed to an earnout structure based on performance. It exited in two stages as HPS got new equity from Dyal Capital in 2018 and Guardian Life in 2022. All told, the bank made between $750 million and $1 billion through its sale of HPS including profits earned along the way.\nTo this day the founder trio remains in charge, having lifted assets from $34 billion in 2016 to above $100 billion. Together, they own about two-thirds of HPS. Based on the mooted value, they\u2019re all billionaires.\nHPS declined to comment on its ownership structure or valuation. JPMorgan didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on its exit terms.\nOld Friends\nFor an idea of how HPS operates, one particular deal this year stands out. The purchase of an Austrian packaging maker doesn\u2019t sound especially glamorous, but it\u2019s the kind of lucrative transaction that used to be meat and drink to Wall Street bankers, who\u2019d typically pull together the debt financing used by private equity firms when snapping up bigger companies.\nThe buyout of Constantia Flexibles by One Rock Capital Partners is doubly noteworthy because it was a team from HPS\u2019 old parent, JPMorgan, that was working with other banks on a \u20ac1.4 billion ($1.5 billion) loan package to help finance the deal. Unbeknown to the banks, top HPS dealmaker Vikas Keswani was working with One Rock on an alternative, according to people with knowledge of the deal.\nKeswani offered One Rock \u20ac1.5 billion if it sidestepped the banks and went with HPS alone, the people familiar say. It accepted. As well as the extra cash, One Rock got more certainty over what it would pay, removing the risk that a deterioration in credit markets, where the banks would have offloaded the debt to a syndicate of investors, would increase the financing cost. It also had an option to defer some interest payments.\nJPMorgan, One Rock and HPS declined to comment on the Constantia episode.\nHPS\u2019 personal contacts are often central to its modus operandi. The One Rock relationship, for example, goes way back. French and the buyout firm\u2019s cofounder Tony Lee began their careers at Salomon Brothers together.\nIts willingness to fly solo, and bid high, is also pivotal. That in turn points to a key risk in private credit: If a borrower goes bust, the hit isn\u2019t shared by a broad syndicate. While direct lenders charge a premium and their loans are pegged to base rates, a borrower may struggle to maintain spiraling interest payments. The nascent industry is untested in a serious recession.\n\u201cThis is a market that\u2019s so private and has gotten so large, and its fundamental strategy is to use leverage,\u201d says Christina Padgett, head of leveraged finance research for Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Piling debt onto an acquired company \u201chas been fine for the last 15 years since rates were low,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut as that\u2019s changed those businesses are now increasingly fragile.\u201d\n\u201cWe expect to see growing stress in the private segment of the loan market,\u201d fund giant Pimco wrote in a note this week.\nCalculated Gambles\nThe HPS founders say they\u2019re happy to back their own number crunching when making chunky wagers, arguing that it\u2019s what sets them apart.\n\u201cWe don't just buy the market,\u201d Patterson says. \u201cSo much of the credit and equity business is along the lines of \u2018show me what other people have done and we\u2019ll do something like that.\u2019 That\u2019s a totally fine way to deliver \u2018down the fairway\u2019 results but it becomes dangerous as what everyone actually does is things that are just a little bit worse than the last person.\u201d\nSpeaking about hefty loans \u2014 to businesses such as Constantia, aircraft maker Bombardier Inc. and Ambassador Theatre Group \u2014 he adds that HPS doesn\u2019t only check out what comparable companies are worth: \u201cWe're looking at detailed historical financials, a deep analysis of the company and taking some additional downside protection\u201d on how a loan\u2019s structured.\n\u201cOur competitors refer to us as the nerds of private credit and we take no offense,\u201d says French, who along with Patterson manages four-fifths of HPS\u2019 assets. Patterson looks after the senior loans, which pay out first if a company hits trouble. French takes care of the off-piste, higher-yielding gambits; deals that other debt funds might not have the stomach for.\nPatterson, who owns an organic farm in Connecticut with his wife Nina, likes to be patient and tends to fret about worst-case scenarios. French, a bicoastal jetsetter with a passion for sporting events, is less restrained. His funds offer anything from junior debt to equity, stretching the returns it can generate \u2014 and the very definition of private credit.\nOne of French\u2019s jewels is Authentic Brands, owner of Reebok, Juicy Couture and Brooks Brothers. He was introduced to its CEO, Jamie Salter, by another entrepreneur whom he\u2019d lent to. In 2021 HPS made an equity investment alongside CVC Capital Partners that valued Authentic at nearly $13 billion. A new investment by General Atlantic has lifted that to $20 billion.\nThe Midas touch hasn\u2019t always been apparent, though. HPS was forced to take control of Brazilian call-center operator Atento after its value plunged. It\u2019s in discussions to take over another struggling borrower, Berlin Brands, an e-commerce company backed by Bain Capital.\nSome attempts to diversify HPS have foundered, too, including a growth-equity business. Its targeting of \u201cNAV lending\u201d \u2014 providing debt to buyout firms secured on their holdings \u2014 and real-estate loans is faring better, bolstered by a fresh batch of Goldman Sachs recruits.\nMike Koester, cofounder of 5C Investment Partners and former cohead of alternative investments at Goldman Sachs, who\u2019s worked with Kapnick and Patterson, says they\u2019ve brought the \u201cGoldman ethos\u201d to HPS: \u201cOnly a few firms can do both deep investment work and develop deep relationships. HPS is one of the few, and has the capability to do it at scale.\u201d\nPrivate Pleasures\nFor a firm as active as HPS, it\u2019s surprising how few people outside private capital even know about it. Listed rivals such as Blackstone Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. built their names over decades in private equity.\nTwo direct peers, Ares Management Corp. and Blue Owl Capital Inc., have done initial public offerings. HPS has been thinking about following suit at a valuation of about $8 billion and has confidentially filed for a listing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The firm has been working with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. The banks declined to comment.\n\u201cThe path that others have taken going public made sense for them and seems to have worked well for those firms,\u201d says Kapnick. \u201cBut my job as CEO is to make sure we don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\nOne advantage of a listing is that HPS could use its shares for acquisitions. Many smaller rivals are struggling to raise funds and want to sell up instead.\nStaying private has other complications. After the partners bought HPS, several senior employees quit, complaining about not getting adequate equity stakes, according to people familiar. HPS does now award equity to its top performers through a discreet partnership scheme, the same people say, although there are no public references to that.\nOwnership has made the core founders very rich. Kapnick has a 12,000-square foot Florida mansion worth about $50 million and last year sold a limestone house in New York\u2019s Upper East Side for $27.5 million. The trio are all collectors of art, including works by Julie Mehretu and Damien Hirst, as well as Stella and Basquiat.\nThe firm is also a presence on the billionaire philanthropy scene. Kapnick has a $55 million personal foundation. Recently the HPS founders hosted a client event, and a dinner for friends, with ex-President Obama after agreeing to donate $10 million to a new athletic center in Chicago.\nConversations with current policymakers may be less convivial. US officials, the European Union, the IMF and the BoE have all voiced fears about the opacity of nonbank finance titans. While private capital\u2019s rise does move credit risk away from banks, the asset class is illiquid by nature. Investors such as insurers and pension funds will find it hard to sell their positions, even if they sour.\nKapnick, however, argues that the industry he helped birth is a bulwark against future crises. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be moments when you need bad actors looking into,\u201d he concludes. \u201cBut regulators will look back and say we have a better, safer banking system.\u201d\n--With assistance from Gillian Tan, Laura Benitez, Tom Maloney, Libby Cherry, Claire Ruckin and Boris Korby.\n(Updates with confidential IPO filing in second paragraph under Private Pleasures section)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAnduril Builds a Tiny, Reusable Fighter Jet That Blows Up Drones\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

Efforts to bring out the 41 men have been slowed by snags in drilling through the debris in the mountainous terrain.\nA 30-second video provided by authorities showed about a dozen of the trapped men standing in a semi-circle in front of the camera, wearing helmets and construction worker jackets over their clothes against the backdrop of the lights in the tunnel.\nA rescue worker outside could be heard telling the men to present themselves before the camera one by one, to confirm their identities on the walkie-talkie gear that had been sent in.\nThe video was shot through a medical endoscopy camera that was pushed through a second, wider pipeline of 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter, drilled through the debris on Monday, authorities said.\nIn the clip, the trapped men appeared to be doing fine, answering that they were all right in response to queries about their well-being, said one official in the rescue control room who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\nRescuers are set on Tuesday to resume drilling horizontally through a 60-metre (195-ft) pile of debris to push through a pipe large enough for the trapped men to crawl out.\nDrilling had been suspended on Friday after a machine snag and fears of a fresh collapse.\nAuthorities are simultaneously working on five other plans to pull out the workers, including drilling vertically from the top of the mountain.\nAbhishek Sharma, a psychiatrist sent to the site by the state government, said he had asked the 41 men to walk within the 2-km (1.2-mile) area where they are confined, do light yoga exercises and talk regularly among themselves to keep occupied.\n\"Sleep is very important for them ... and as of now they have been sleeping well and not reported any difficulties in sleeping,\" Sharma told Reuters, adding that the men were in good spirits and keen to emerge soon.\nAnother doctor at the site, Prem Pokhriyal, said the men had been asked to avoid heavy workouts that could boost accumulation of carbon dioxide gas in the confined space as they breathe out.\nThe trapped men are low-wage workers, most of them from poor states in India's north and east.\n\"He said he is doing fine,\" Sunita Hembrom, the sister-in-law of one of the workers trapped in the tunnel, Surendra Kisko, told reporters after she spoke to him.\n\"He said, 'Take care of yourselves, the children and parents.

The congestion pricing plan, which neighboring New Jersey has filed a lawsuit over, will be the first such program in the United States if it is approved by transportation officials early next year.\nUnder the plan, passenger car drivers entering Manhattan south of 60th Street during daytime hours would be charged $15 electronically, while the fee for small trucks would be $24 and large trucks would be charged $36.\nCities such as London and Stockholm have similar programs in place, but New York City is poised to become the first in the U.S.\nRevenue from the tolls, projected to be roughly $1 billion annually, would be used to finance borrowing to upgrade the city\u2019s mass transit systems.\nThe proposal from the Traffic Mobility Review Board, a New York state body charged with advising the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on the tolls, includes discounts for travel between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. and for frequent low-income drivers. Government vehicles such as municipal garbage trucks would be exempt.\nTaxi drivers would pass a $1.25 surcharge onto their passengers for entering the congestion zone, while app-based ride-hail passengers would see a $2.50 surcharge.\nOfficials say that in addition to funding needed transit improvements, congestion pricing will result in improved air quality and reduced traffic.\n\u201cAbsent this we\u2019re going to choking in our own traffic for a long time to come and the MTA is not going to have the funds necessary to provide quality service,\u201d Carl Weisbrod, chair of the traffic review board, said in presenting the report to MTA officials.\nOpponents include taxi drivers, who had pushed for a full exemption.\n\u201cThe city has already decimated the taxi industry with years of unregulated, unchecked competition from Uber and Lyft, and the MTA seems poised to land a final blow to the prospect of stability and modest survival,\" Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York City Taxi Workers Alliance, said in a news release. \u201cIf this proposal is implemented, thousands of driver families will get dragged back into crisis-level poverty with no relief in sight.\u201d\nNew Jersey Gov.

The decision, which Alibaba said was fueled by Washington's chip curbs, also highlighted that US-China ties are still frayed after a meeting between the country's presidents failed to make a splash.\nStocks just barely notched a win Friday after initially slipping earlier in the day. The major indexes recorded their third-straight win for the week.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged higher by 0.13%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished just above the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose by about 0.08%.\nWall Street's AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) is among the major names to report earnings next week. The supplier of AI tech will offer investors fresh data on the state of the industry, steering the case for or against the much-hyped AI tech boom that has elevated many of Big Tech's largest players.\nRetail market observers will also get new information and forecasts from large chains including Lowe's (LOW), Dick's (DKS) and Best Buy (BBY). The trio follows a significant week of retail earnings where the major theme was a more discerning, weakened consumer.\nInvestors will also get further insight into the thinking and deliberation of US central bankers with the release of the Fed's policy meeting minutes. The meeting summary will arrive about three weeks ahead of the next Federal Open Market Committee huddle, where investors and the broader public will learn if 2023 has seen the end of the Fed's rate hikes.\nYahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:\nHopes of a \"soft landing,\" in which the Fed is able to pull inflation back to its 2% target without triggering a recession are rekindling. But investors have reasons to worry, too, reports Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer.\nThe stock market appears to be increasingly pricing in the possibility of that the Fed will execute a \"soft landing.\" And unlike prior instances earlier this year, when optimists soured on the idea of a near-perfectly executed tightening cycle, there's been nearly a year's worth of data since then. What's more, there's growing consensus that inflation is cooling, that the jobs market is no longer running unsustainably hot, and that the Fed is done hiking interest rates.\nThe question remains if those trends can continue. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius says they will, noting that the path of disinflation is set to continue and that consumer spending should hold up despite excess savings getting depleted.\nBut there's still an argument that financial conditions could tighten significantly, as the Fed's \"higher for longer\" interest rate campaign is expected to slow business activity. That sluggishness could lead to job cuts, snowballing into industry-wide layoffs, eventually creating a vicious cycle that leads to a recession that many have been warning about.\n\"I don't think we should be celebrating accomplishing that soft landing until we actually see inflation back close to that 2% target, and the economy is still moving forward,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told Yahoo Finance in an interview on Thursday . \"That's really the open question for 2024.\"\nAs long as that debate remains open, it will be a key question for investors in 2024, too.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is up roughly 10% so far this month, and some analysts believe there's still room to grow, heading into an end-of-year rally.\nAs Wall Street embraces a newfound optimism that the Fed's hiking campaign has come to an end, bullish investors see tech titans like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) leading portfolios higher.\n\"Heading into 2024 we believe the tech sector is set up for an acceleration of spending around cloud and AI spending that we believe is being significantly underestimated by the Street,\" said Dan Ives and several colleagues at Webush, in a research note Friday. Ives, along with his co-authors, nodded to the potential of what he describes as the transformational technology of AI, and points to the monetization that has already had an impact on stocks like Microsoft and Datadog (DDOG).\n\"We believe the new tech bull market has now begun and tech stocks are set up for a strong 2024 as the AI spending tidal wave hits the shores of the broader tech sector,\" the analysts said.\nStill, what others see as overstretched valuations and an AI hype-cycle that is bound to disappoint expectations are reasons to stay cautious. Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings next week will offer the latest set of data points for the case in favor of big tech and AI.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday:\nChargePoint (CHPT): The EV charging company fell by more than 30% on Friday after it released preliminary third quarter results showing revenue will fall as low as $108 million, well below the expected lower range of $150 million. In addition, the company announced its CEO and CFO were exiting. COO Rick WIlmer will become the new CEO while the company searches for a permanent CFO.\nRoss (ROST): Shares rose nearly 8% Friday afternoon after the discount retailer posted better than expected quarterly results and raised its outlook as consumers looked to navigate high inflation by hunting for bargains.\nGap (GPS): The clothing retailer surged 30% after the retailer reported third quarter earnings that blew away expectations. The strong market reaction comes after a big week of earnings from major retailers including Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and Home Depot (HD), which also beat expectations but offered cautious outlooks.\nBJ's Wholesale Club (BJ): The warehouse club chain sank 3% Friday after reporting weaker than expected quarterly sales and, like many other retailers, forecast slower holiday season traffic.\nStocks wavered in afternoon trading on Friday, with all the major indexes slipping under the flat line, while still clinging to overall gains for the week.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by about 0.03%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by .05% or roughly 20 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.1%.\nConsumers stayed strong after quarter upon quarter of inflation. But finally, the steadfast swipe-the-card resilience is giving way to discretion. These days, shoppers at big box retailers are moderating their spending, becoming more selective, avoiding big-ticket items, and delaying purchases.\nIn earnings calls this week, executives sketched portraits of a more discerning American consumer, worn down by higher costs and coping with the anxieties of mounting credit card debt and dwindling savings. Major retailers including Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and Home Depot (HD), beat expectations but offered cautious outlooks for the months ahead, as consumers moderate pull back.\nRetail sales fell 0.1% in October from the prior month, according to new data from the Commerce Department, notching the first monthly decline since March.\n\"While it is somewhat encouraging to see that spending did not fall off a cliff in October, the pause is likely a sign of further weakness to come,\u201d said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies, in a research note after the retail sales report.\nA weakened consumer can still be strong enough for corporate earnings, especially if companies can beat lowered expectations. But selective shopping and budget stretching can only take the economy so far.\nPresident Joe Biden has signed into law a temporary \"two-step\" solution to Washington\u2019s spending fights and will give Congress and the country a temporary reprieve from shutdown fights at least for the holiday season.\nThe business community breathed a sigh of relief that a stoppage, and the economic effects that would have come with it, was averted,\nreports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul.\nBusiness Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten offered thanks in a statement to \u201cmembers of Congress for working together,\u201d while adding that he hoped the cooperation could be repeated next year when the spending debates resume.\nThe 32-page law sidestepped yet another self-inflicted Washington crisis and averted a government shutdown that, among many other impacts, had threatened to cut off the paychecks of TSA workers just ahead of the busy Thanksgiving travel week. The deal's two steps include funds for some areas of the federal government \u2014 places like the Agriculture and Transportation departments \u2014 until Jan. 19, 2024. Authorization for the remainder of Washington's bureaucracy is set to expire just two weeks later on Feb. 2.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday:\nApplied Materials (AMAT): Shares of one of the largest chipmakers in the US fell more than 4% following a report that the company faces a criminal probe for allegedly violating export restrictions to China. The Justice Department will investigate the company's dealings with China\u2019s biggest chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (0981.HK), looking at whether Applied Materials sold hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment without the proper licenses.\nGap (GPS): The clothing retailer surged nearly 30% Friday morning after the retailer reported third quarter earnings that blew away expectations. The strong market reaction comes after a big week of earnings from major retailers including Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and Home Depot (HD), which also beat expectations but offered cautious outlooks.\nBJ's Wholesale Club (BJ): The warehouse club chain sank 3% Friday after reporting weaker than expected quarterly sales and, like other retailers, forecast slower holiday season traffic.\nAlibaba (BABA): Shares slid nearly 3% after the company's listing in Hong Kong saw $20 billion of its market cap evaporate following a decision to no longer spin off its cloud computing business.\nStocks were little changed at the start of the trading session Friday, setting Wall Street up for a weekly win, even as the indexes were dipping slightly into the red.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by about 0.04%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just over the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.1%.",

        "text": "\nBy Samrhitha A and David Shepardson\n(Reuters) -General Motors' robotaxi unit Cruise is planning to re-launch in one unspecified city before expanding to others, just weeks after California barred its self-driving vehicles from public roads following an accident last month.\nCruise last week paused all supervised and manual car trips in the United States while also expanding a safety review of its robotaxis, causing tumult within the company and compelling its CEO Kyle Vogt and chief product officer Daniel Kan to step down.\nIt is also a setback for an industry dependent on public trust and the cooperation of regulators. Cruise had in recent months touted ambitious plans to expand to more cities, offering fully autonomous taxi rides.\n\"Once we have taken steps to improve our safety culture and rebuild trust, our strategy is to re-launch in one city and prove our performance there, before expanding,\" the company said in a statement.\nThe GM unit said it would focus on the Bolt-based Cruise AVs in the near term with a longer term strategy around the Origin, a multi-passenger vehicle designed without a steering wheel or other controls for operation by a human driver.\nIt told employees in an email, which was read to Reuters, that it will also cut some jobs, \"primarily in non-engineering roles\" and would provide more details in mid-December.\nA GM spokesman said its finance chief Paul Jacobson would likely address the financial impact on the automaker during a call with analysts scheduled for Nov. 29.\nBefore Cruise suspended operations, GM CEO Mary Barra had said Cruise and its autonomous vehicle technology could generate $50 billion in revenue by 2030, making the robotaxi business a big piece of her strategy to double revenue to $280 billion.\nGM lost more than $700 million at Cruise in the third quarter and more than $8 billion since 2016.\nMeanwhile, it now faces higher labor costs under a new United Auto Workers contract, slower-than-expected sales of its electric vehicles and costly new emissions standards from Washington.\nGM's troubles have led to a 16% slide in its shares so far this year, compared with a near 19% rise in the broader S&P 500 index.\n\"Investors will be watching closely to evaluate whether management sees GM's challenges as limited to Cruise or if there is broader discussion about capital allocation across GM's portfolio,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note Wednesday.\nNOT IN SAN FRANCISCO\nGM and Cruise did not disclose the city where it would relaunch operations but it is unlikely to be in San Francisco, where the accident took place.\nThe incident involved another vehicle and ended with one of its self-driving taxis dragging a pedestrian. California authorities have pulled the company's license to operate driverless rides.\nCruise has operations in Phoenix and Austin, where regulators have been more accommodating. Its rival Waymo too has extensive operations in the cities.\nAs part of its previous expansion plans, Cruise had last year asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for permission to deploy up to 2,500 self-driving vehicles annually without human controls.\nWithout government approval, GM cannot deploy the Origin on public roads. The NHTSA said in July it \"will issue a decision in the coming weeks\" before the accident raised questions about safety.\nCruise also said it would compensate employees for potential tax liability of shares granted by the company. It had last week decided to make a new tender offer to allow them to sell shares, two days after cancelling an earlier offer.\nSuspension of the program had sparked backlash from some employees who said they would face heavy tax burdens on the stocks that were vested at a much higher valuation on Oct. 15.\n(Reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam in Bengaluru, David Shepardson in Washington and Joe White in Detroit; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Arun Koyyur)",

        "text": "\nLANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Michigan is joining an effort to curb deceptive uses of artificial intelligence and manipulated media through state-level policies as Congress and the Federal Elections Commission continue to debate more sweeping regulations ahead of the 2024 elections.\nCampaigns on the state and federal level will be required to clearly say which political advertisements airing in Michigan were created using artificial intelligence under legislation expected to be signed in the coming days by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. It also would prohibit use of AI-generated deepfakes within 90 days of an election without a separate disclosure identifying the media as manipulated.\nDeepfakes are fake media that misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn't. They're created using generative artificial intelligence, a type of AI that can create convincing images, videos or audio clips in seconds.\nThere are increasing concerns that generative AI will be used in the 2024 presidential race to mislead voters, impersonate candidates and undermine elections on a scale and at a speed not yet seen.\nCandidates and committees in the race already are experimenting with the rapidly advancing technology, which in recent years has become cheaper, faster and easier for the public to use.\nThe Republican National Committee in April released an entirely AI-generated ad meant to show the future of the United States if President Joe Biden is reelected. Disclosing in small print that it was made with AI, it featured fake but realistic photos showing boarded-up storefronts, armored military patrols in the streets, and huge increases in immigration creating panic.\nIn July, Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, used an AI voice cloning tool to imitate former President Donald Trump\u2019s voice, making it seem like he narrated a social media post he made despite never saying the statement aloud.\nExperts say these are just glimpses of what could ensue if campaigns or outside actors decide to use AI deepfakes in more malicious ways.\nSo far, states including California, Minnesota, Texas and Washington have passed laws regulating deepfakes in political advertising. Similar legislation has been introduced in Illinois, New Jersey and New York, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen.\nUnder Michigan's legislation, any person, committee or other entity that distributes an advertisement for a candidate would be required to clearly state if it uses generative AI. The disclosure would need to be in the same font size as the majority of the text in print ads, and would need to appear \u201cfor at least four seconds in letters that are as large as the majority of any text\" in television ads, according to a legislative analysis from the state House Fiscal Agency.\nDeepfakes used within 90 days of the election would require a separate disclaimer informing the viewer that the content is manipulated to depict speech or conduct that did not occur. If the media is a video, the disclaimer would need to be clearly visible and appear throughout the video's entirety.\nCampaigns could face a misdemeanor punishable by up to 93 days in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both for the first violation of the proposed laws. The attorney general or the candidate harmed by the deceptive media could apply to the appropriate circuit court for relief.\nFederal lawmakers on both sides have stressed the importance of legislating deepfakes in political advertising, and held meetings to discuss it, but Congress has not yet passed anything.\nA recent bipartisan Senate bill, co-sponsored by Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and others, would ban \u201cmaterially deceptive\u201d deepfakes relating to federal candidates, with exceptions for parody and satire.\nMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson flew to Washington, D.C. in early November to participate in a bipartisan discussion on AI and elections and called on senators to pass Klobuchar and Hawley's federal Deceptive AI Act. Benson said she also encouraged senators to return home and lobby their state lawmakers to pass similar legislation that makes sense for their states.\nFederal law is limited in its ability to regulate AI at the state and local levels, Benson said in an interview, adding that states also need federal funds to tackle the challenges posed by AI.\n\u201cAll of this is made real if the federal government gave us money to hire someone to just handle AI in our states, and similarly educate voters about how to spot deepfakes and what to do when you find them,\u201d Benson said. \u201cThat solves a lot of the problems. We can\u2019t do it on our own.\u201d\nIn August, the Federal Election Commission took a procedural step toward potentially regulating AI-generated deepfakes in political ads under its existing rules against \u201cfraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d Though the commission held a public comment period on the petition, brought by Public Citizen, it hasn\u2019t yet made any ruling.\nSocial media companies also have announced some guidelines meant to mitigate the spread of harmful deepfakes. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, announced earlier this month that it will require political ads running on the platforms to disclose if they were created using AI. Google unveiled a similar AI labeling policy in September for political ads that play on YouTube or other Google platforms.\n___\nThe story has been updated to remove Kentucky from states where similar legislation has been introduced. Kentucky\u2019s legislation is a bill request and has not been officially introduced yet.\n___\nSwenson reported from New York. Associated Press writer Christina A. Cassidy contributed from Washington.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Celsius lawyers have said the platform could start distributing assets early next year.\nThe ruling is a major milestone for Celsius, which went bankrupt last year amid a downturn in digital assets but won enough creditor support for a path through Chapter 11 despite fraud allegations against former executives.\nFederal prosecutors have accused former Celsius Chief Executive Officer Alex Mashinsky of manipulating the firm\u2019s native CEL token and making misleading statements to get customers to invest their assets on the platform. Mashinsky has pleaded not guilty.\nCelsius\u2019s plan to transform into a crypto miner has been met with skepticism from some of its customers and still faces regulatory hurdles. The company has said it must also be approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and that Celsius could pivot to a liquidation if the crypto mining proposal falls through.\nJudge Glenn has urged the SEC to move quickly in deciding whether or not to approve Celsius\u2019 plan to emerge from Chapter 11 as a publicly listed Bitcoin mining firm.\nThe ruling approving Celsius\u2019 plan capped a multiweek trial in which individual customers questioned the company\u2019s new management team and expressed frustration with the firm\u2019s bankruptcy plan as well as the cost of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Customers argued the plan significantly undervalues Celsius\u2019 CEL token, which will essentially be used to dole out digital assets and stock in the new Bitcoin miner to creditors.\nCelsius bankruptcy lawyers said CEL was essentially worthless when the crypto firm filed Chapter 11 in 2022, arguing the native token served as a proxy for company stock, which is usually wiped-out in bankruptcy. Judge Glenn said Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy plan averted the need for him to rule on whether CEL constitutes a security, a thorny legal issue that has broader implications on how the crypto industry is regulated in the US.\nThe bankruptcy is Celsius Network LLC, 22-10964, US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan).\n(Adds context beginning in paragraph five.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Axios had earlier reported the Burns visit.\nIsrael and Hamas have agreed to pause fighting until early Thursday, extending their truce to six days. Blinken\u2019s visit and US efforts have been focused on keeping the devastating conflict from spreading further in the Middle East.\nQatar has received guarantees that 20 hostages will be released over the next 48 hours, Majed Al Ansari, a spokesman for the country\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a press conference, emphasizing that Qatar\u2019s aim is to secure a longer truce.\nBlinken\u2019s talks are aimed at pressing for a long term solution to the crisis including the creation of an independent Palestinian state, the State Department said in a statement late Monday. The top US diplomat will also \u201cstress the need to sustain the increased flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, secure the release of all hostages, and improve protections for civilians in Gaza,\u201d it said.\nThe current halt \u2014 which began Friday after negotiations brokered by Qatar, with the help of Egypt and the US \u2014 was originally due to end Tuesday.\nThe talks have brought the release of almost 70 of the 240 hostages taken when Hamas swarmed across Gaza\u2019s northern border and have led to the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. There\u2019s been increased delivery of aid into Gaza.\nMore aid supplies are needed to alleviate a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d situation there, Tor Wennesland, the United Nations\u2019 special coordinator for the Middle East Process, said on X. Large areas of the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where Israel says Hamas has its main bases, has been reduced to rubble by Israeli air strikes. Authorities in the Hamas-run territory estimate that more than 15,000 people have been killed.\nThe extended cease-fire is expected to continue the exchange of small groups of people, with roughly one hostage held in Gaza released for three Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.\nIsrael\u2019s government, which has said it\u2019s pursuing the twin aims of securing the release of captives and dismantling Hamas, has been pressured by public concern over those who have been abducted to keep pushing for the release of more of its citizens as details of the conditions under which they were kept begin to seep out.\nThe limited release sparked a mass rally in Tel Aviv over the weekend and renewed calls from groups representing the families of the hostages for more to be set free and access to those who remain to be given the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nThe government has reiterated its intention to continue the war once the cease-fire is over. The conflict will cost the economy 198 billion shekels ($53 billion), driven primarily by defense spending, Israel\u2019s central bank said Monday.\nGrowth projections for this year and next were also slashed by the Bank of Israel\u2019s research department, which predicted a budget deficit of 5% for 2024 as the government on Monday approved a revised fiscal plan for 2023 that will boost expenditure amid disputes over outlays for religious programs and West Bank settlements.\n--With assistance from Kateryna Kadabashy.\n(Adds source on talks in Qatar, third paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nChinese Car Companies Cracked North America by Going to Mexico\nScientists and Farmers Race to Save the World\u2019s Banana Supply\nMBA Alternative Augment Clinches $3.7 Million in New Funding\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

It was the lowest reading since July, 2021.\nBut growth disappeared as output shrank after months of stagnation near zero.\nGermany, the largest of the 20 countries that use the euro, saw its economy output fall by 0.1%, while No. 2 economy France only scraped out 0.1% growth, slowing from 0.6% in the previous quarter.\nEurope may have been pushed into negative territory by a statistical quirk involving Ireland, according to Rory Fennessy, economist at Oxford Economics. Ireland's drop in GDP of 1.8% was the largest among eurozone economies - but disproportionately reflects the finances of multinational companies that are based there.\nEconomic momentum remains weak for the months ahead, and will only recover pace when wages catch up with inflation, he wrote in a research note. \u201cThe eurozone is set for a period of economic stagnation,\u201d he said.\nThe lower inflation figure follows a rapid series of interest rate hikes by the European Central Bank. Higher central bank rates are the typical medicine against inflation that\u2019s too high. They influence borrowing costs throughout the economy, raising the cost of credit for purchases such as homes or for expanding factories or offices. That reduces the demand for goods and thus restrains price increases.\nBut high rates can also slow growth. In recent months they have slammed credit-sensitive sectors like construction of new houses and business facilities. Meanwhile lingering inflation has still been high enough to hold back spending by consumers who had to set more money aside for necessaries like food and utility bills.\nThe future path of inflation toward the ECB's target remain uncertain because core inflation, excluding volatile fuel and food prices, remains higher than the headline figure, at 4.2%. Meanwhile other indications of future inflation such as company's expectations for selling prices have seen a \u201chuge decline,\u201d said Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics.\nThe current burst of inflation was set off as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to shortages of parts and raw materials. It worsened when Russian invaded Ukraine, sending energy prices soaring as Moscow cut off most natural gas to Europe.\nEurope's sluggish economy contrasts with robust growth of 4.9% in the same quarter in the U.S, where the economy was boosted by free-spending consumers and by businesses rebuilding inventories despite a similar rapid series of rate increases by the Federal Reserve.",

The data reinforced expectations that the Fed has completed its rate hiking cycle.\nWhile New York Fed President John Williams reiterated the central bank's determination to remain data dependent, he would not rule out the possibility of further rate hikes if inflation fails to continue to moderate.\n\"Kicking off much of the strength this month was the realization that inflation is quickly coming back to earth we saw that again today with core PCE data suggesting inflation is no longer a major headwind,\" Detrick added.\nFinancial markets have priced in a 95.8% likelihood that the central bank will let its key Fed funds target rate stand at 5.25%-5.50% at December's policy meeting.\n\"There's likely no rate hikes any time soon, the next move will likely be a cut, probably in the middle of next year,\" Detrick said. \"The massive drop in (Treasury) yields this month is the bond market's way of saying it thinks the Fed is indeed done raising rates.\"\nPowell is scheduled to participate in two separate discussions on Friday, at 11 a.m. ET and again at 2 p.m. ET.\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 18.21 points, or 0.38%, to end at 4,568.79 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 32.27 points, or 0.23%, to 14,226.22.

        "text": "\nFor the past six months, employees at the tech company Expensify in San Francisco have had a special in-office perk: an upscale lounge offering them free specialty cocktails and other drinks. From its 16th-floor office, workers could enjoy champagne or a draft beer while collaborating in a restaurant-style booth or working on laptops at the bar.\nBut the lounge is due to close on November 1. The point, CEO David Barrett explained in a blog post on Wednesday, was to run an experiment.\nFounded 15 years ago, the $215 million market-cap Expensify, which sells an expense-reporting app, was a remote-first company well before the pandemic. It even has an offshore program, in which employees can work abroad together for a few weeks every year.\nBut with COVID forcing millions of people to work from home, Barrett wrote, \u201cwe recognized that we were living through a transformational time for the rest of the market, and decided to fix up one of our offices and run a little experiment around a very simple question: Can anything bring workers back to the office voluntarily?\u201d\nThe answer, he concluded, was mostly no: \u201cIn practice, the lounge was a place that people would generally visit, marvel at, work for a bit, and leave.\u201d\nBased on the experiment, he believes that employees at other companies currently working in the office \u201care likely going because they feel pressured to (either by their boss or their peers), not because it's actually their preferred place to be.\u201d\nAt Amazon, employees staged a walkout earlier this year over the company\u2019s return-to-office mandate, but managers now have the green light to terminate workers who ignore it, according to guidelines seen by Insider last week. Nike, meanwhile, recently updated its return-to-office policy from three days to four.\nBut while the return-to-office trend has been gaining steam, some companies are ignoring it. Nvidia, a $1 trillion AI powerhouse, offers luxurious office spaces, but it still lets employees decide whether to use them. Canva, the graphic design startup valued at $26 billion last year, has taken a similar approach.\nIn a recent survey of over 8,400 U.S. workers by FlexJobs, 63% of respondents said remote work was still the most important part of a job to them, ahead of salary and a good boss.\nBarrett believes there\u2019s still a place for offices, but as a society \u201cwe're just never going back to a regular nine-to-five office culture, a staple of not just our modern culture, but also the foundation of most urban planning.\u201d\nIn New York City, Mayor Eric Adams announced a plan in August to convert empty office buildings into housing. \u201cCOVID taught us something,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want to acknowledge it or not, we are in a different norm. Everything has changed, and we have to be willing to change with it.\u201d\nCompanies now insisting that employees return to the office might want to reconsider, Barrett suggested: \u201cIf the best office in the entire planet can't compete with the local coffee shop, the tightly closed Pandora's box of \u2018work from anywhere\u2019 has burst open, and will never be resealed. No amount of begging or coercion is going to work in the long run: The businesses that demand it are fighting a losing war of attrition against an infinite universal energy.\u201d\nBut he noted that Expensify did derive a few other benefits from the lounge experiment, such as using it as a laboratory to test new products and impressing possible clients.\nAs Barrett wrote, \u201cIt was an incredible brand experience: Despite how lavish it seemed, from a cost perspective it was orders of magnitude cheaper to fix someone a cocktail in our own bar than to try to talk to that same potential customer at a conference booth.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

That put it not far off the three-decade low of 151.94 it touched in October last year that led Japanese authorities to intervene to prop up the currency.\nIn recent weeks the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has also intervened heavily in its bond market to suppress yields, pitting itself against market forces as global rates have risen.\nThe BoJ will face pressure at its meeting next week to shift away from bond-yield control, with any nod to tighter Japanese policy potentially strengthening the yen and encouraging domestic investors to sell overseas assets.

        "text": "\nBy Jonathan Stempel\nOct 31 (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania jury has ordered Mitsubishi Motors to pay nearly $977 million in damages to a man who said he became a quadriplegic in a vehicle rollover because of an alleged defective seatbelt.\nJurors in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas on Monday awarded Francis Amagasu, 58, and his wife $176,551,384 in compensatory damages and $800 million in punitive damages, according to Kyle Farrar, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers.\nMitsubishi said it was disappointed with the verdict and intended to appeal.\nAmagasu's injuries stemmed from a Nov. 11, 2017 accident in Buckingham Township, Pennsylvania when, while wearing his seatbelt, he lost control of his 1992 Mitsubishi 3000GT as he tried to avoid another vehicle.\nThe plaintiffs said the seatbelt's design was defective because it allowed the release of four inches of slack during a collision, causing Amagasu to strike his head on the car roof.\nThey also said Mitsubishi failed to perform rollover testing, and that its conduct was reckless.\nJurors began hearing evidence on Oct. 20. They deliberated briefly on Oct. 27 before returning their verdict.\nIn a statement, Mitsubishi Motors North America called the damages award \"egregious,\" and said there were \"significant legal and evidentiary issues\" to be addressed in an appeal.\n\"Mitsubishi Motors vehicles are and have been among the safest on the road, having won multiple safety awards to attest to that fact,\" it added.\nFarrar, a principal at Farrar & Ball, said he thought the verdict would be upheld, reflecting Amagasu's injuries. He also said the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages was in line with U.S. Supreme Court guidance.\n\"The evidence regarding the defective nature of this seatbelt was overwhelming, and not something that the average consumer would ever know about,\" Farrar added.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York Editing by Marguerita Choy)",

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- For close to a decade, WeWork seemed unstoppable. The company grew rapidly and spent extravagantly.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nRockstar Plans to Announce Much Anticipated \u2018Grand Theft Auto VI\u2019\nTwo-Year Yield Tops 5% on Powell\u2019s \u2018Sterner\u2019 Tone: Markets Wrap\nGriffin Says Peace Dividend Over, High Inflation to Last Decades\nSaudis Find a Bottomless Money Pit in Lucid\nIsrael Latest: US Says Forces Attacked Again After Syria Strike\nOn Monday, WeWork declared bankruptcy. While the co-working company could eventually emerge from the Chapter 11 process and survive in some form, the filing marks a new low for a business that was one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups as recently as 2019.\nAfter four years of near-consistent mockery, it can be hard to remember how promising WeWork once appeared. Here are some of the highlights from the company\u2019s rise and fall:\n1. Beer kegs in the office\nAdam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey started WeWork in 2010 selling desks and an ideal of what an office should be like. One of their essential amenities was beer on tap. WeWork had the support of some powerful venture capital firms, including Benchmark. In 2015, Bloomberg Businessweek put Neumann on the magazine\u2019s cover for the first time, with a headline that captures the early bemusement of WeWork\u2019s VC-fueled, work-hard-play-hard vibe: \u201cIs This the Office of the Future or a $5 Billion Waste of Space? Let\u2019s discuss over by the keg.\u201d There would be many more magazine covers around the world.\n2. Employees catching mice and cleaning up phone-booth vomit\nIn an episode from the WeWork-focused season of the Bloomberg Technology podcast Foundering, employees describe the exciting, chaotic and party-soaked atmosphere of the company\u2019s offices and how that affected the people working there.\n3. Early warning signs\nIn 2016 WeWork cut some of its staff, and Neumann warned his employees in an all-hands meeting that the company had lapsed into a \u201cspending culture.\u201d (In the years after that, the company would spend much more lavishly than it did then.) Around the same time, employees began suing the company over alleged labor violations.\n4. Summer Camp\nA key part of WeWork\u2019s corporate culture included the annual summer blowout for employees and customers, which featured canoes full of beer, rah-rah speeches from executives and headlining music sets from artists such as Lorde, The Weeknd and Florence + the Machine. In another episode of Foundering, former employees said the experience could be unnerving \u2014 like going to Coachella but organized by your boss \u2014 but that the celebratory energy and the sense of purpose kept them motivated.\n5. A dorm for adults\nWeWork already promised to blur the boundaries of work life and social life. Why not home as well? The company opened two residential apartment buildings called WeLive; the tagline was \u201cBuild a world where no one feels alone.\u201d Living there was certainly an adjustment for people. \u201cI get this amazing quality of life,\u201d one resident said in 2017. \u201cThe only thing I lack is a door and a wall.\u201d\n6. WeGrow\nThe venture capital kept coming, and SoftBank Group Corp. supercharged things when the firm got involved in 2017. WeWork poured money into a vast array of ventures. One of those was a private elementary school in Manhattan called WeGrow, which was housed in the WeWork headquarters and had interior design from the celebrated architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group. Rebekah Neumann, Adam Neumann\u2019s wife and the company\u2019s chief brand officer, said the school\u2019s goal was \u201craising conscious global citizens\u201d who \u201cunderstand what their superpowers are,\u201d she said at the time, \u201cand use these talents and gifts to help each other and help the world.\u201d\n7. We\nBy 2019 WeWork had rebranded as We Co., with a mission of \u201celevating the world\u2019s consciousness,\u201d and was gearing up for an initial public offering. As part of the renaming, the company agreed to a $5.9 million equity deal with Neumann for a set of trademarks related to the name We that he co-owned through a holding company. Neumann was back on the cover of Businessweek, this time pitching a real estate fund called ARK. (He joked to me that it stood for \u201cAdam, Rebekah and Kids.\u201d) We remained fixated on the company\u2019s unusual financial makeup and asked on the cover line: \u201cWill it ever make money?\u201d\n8. You\u2019re a Creator\nIn the run-up to its 2019 IPO attempt, WeWork\u2019s visions for itself got even more grandiose. The company had spent tens of millions of dollars on the Creator Awards, a series of live pitch competitions with celebrity judges like P. Diddy and performances from bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers. WeWork even pitched TV networks on turning it into a show. By then the company had also bought the iconic Lord & Taylor building in Manhattan in an $850 million deal and had spent tens of millions on other tangential purchases such as a private jet, a search-engine-optimization company and stakes in a superfood startup and a wavepool maker.\n9. IPO flop\nIn the span of a few weeks in fall 2019, WeWork\u2019s big plans to go public crashed to the ground, Neumann was ousted, and the company was scrambling for cash to stay alive. What happened? Here\u2019s the answer in a 13-minute video. In a few words, WeWork\u2019s excessive spending and loose corporate governance were its undoing.\n10. The march to bankruptcy\nSince 2019, WeWork has weathered a pandemic, gone public via a blank-check merger, cycled through a string of interim and \u201cpermanent\u201d CEOs, downsized its real estate portfolio and limped along \u2014 until this August, when it raised doubt about its ability to stay in business.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Authorities have said they are safe, with access to light, oxygen, food, water and medicines.\nAttempts to pull them out by drilling through the debris of rock, stones and metal and pushing through an evacuation pipe have been slowed by snags.\nRescuers had hoped to finish the drilling late on Thursday but had to suspend it after the platform on which the auger machine is placed was damaged, and subsequently a metal pipe was found stuck to the machine, requiring it to be reassembled, a government statement said.\nAn estimated 10-12 metres (33-39 feet) of the debris pile is left to be drilled through. Work resumed on Friday evening only to be suspended soon after as the machine ran into a new obstacle, officials said, without elaborating.\nAuthorities have not said what caused the tunnel collapse, but the region is prone to landslides, earthquakes and floods.\nThe tunnel did not have an emergency exit and was built through a geological fault, a member of a panel of experts\ninvestigating the disaster\ntold Reuters on the condition of anonymity on Friday.\nThe rescue plan involves pushing a pipe wide enough to pull the trapped men out on wheeled stretchers. Rescue workers rehearsed the evacuation by going into the pipe and being pulled out on stretchers, a video clip provided by authorities showed.\nA second plan to drill vertically from atop the hill is also being pursued and the drilling machines are being assembled, the statement said.\nThe men have been getting cooked food since a larger lifeline pipe was pushed through earlier this week and the statement said they were sent 200 rotis or Indian round flat bread, lentils and vegetable curry.\nMore than a dozen doctors, including psychiatrists, have been at the site, talking to the men and monitoring their health.\nThey have been told to do light yoga exercises, walk around in the 2-km space they have been confined to, and keep talking to each other. Rohit Gondwal, a psychiatrist, told Reuters they were also considering sending playing cards and board games such as ludo and chess.\nThe collapsed tunnel is on the Char Dham pilgrimage route, one of the most ambitious projects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.\nIt aims to link four key Hindu pilgrimage sites with 890 km (550 miles) of two-lane road, at a cost of $1.5 billion.\n(Writing by YP Rajesh; Editing by Stephen Coates and Toby Chopra)",

        "text": "\nTo the intrigue of many compact-car enthusiasts, Acura brought back its Integra nameplate for 2023 after a long hiatus. Based on parent company Honda\u2019s Civic, the Integra hatchback debuted with practicality and value in spades but performance that was a bit underwhelming. Thankfully, that changes with the new 2024 Integra Type S. Essentially Acura\u2019s more luxurious take on the Civic Type R, the Integra Type S counts a more powerful engine, stronger brakes, and sharper handling and sportier styling among its upgrades.\nWhile Acura was away from the performance hatch segment, Volkswagen has been honing its Golf R to a fine point. The latest 2024 Golf R boasts a specialized all-wheel-drive system, a strong turbocharged engine, and all of the hatchback practicality and German-engineered comfort this car is known for. Which of these hatchbacks is the better buy? Edmunds\u2019 car experts compare them to find out.\nPOWER AND ACCELERATION\nThe Volkswagen Golf R comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to either a six-speed manual transmission or a seven-speed automatic. This turbo-four makes a healthy 315 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, though getting the manual drops output slightly by 15 lb-ft. Of the two combos, Edmunds found the automatic makes the most of the engine. In testing, the Golf R ripped from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.3 seconds.\nThe Integra Type S\u2019 turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes a similar amount of power: 320 horsepower and 310 lb-ft. A six-speed manual is the only transmission offered, however, and it routes power through the front wheels. As such, off-the-line acceleration isn\u2019t as quick, with the Type S needing 5.7 seconds to get to 60 mph. Once rolling, the two cars are pretty even, but the advantages of the Golf R\u2019s traction-enhancing all-wheel drive and quick-shifting automatic are undeniable.\nWinner: Golf R\nINTERIOR AND TECHNOLOGY\nYou\u2019d think Volkswagen would have perfected the Golf R\u2019s interior design after all these years, but the latest generation is a disappointment. The control interface utilizes a lot of touch-sensitive controls on the dash and steering wheel that look high-tech but are actually frustrating and distracting to use. At least the fundamentals are here with comfortable seating and a hatchback cargo area that\u2019s pretty helpful for fitting bulky items when you fold down the rear seats.\nWhile the Integra Type S is more liftback than hatchback, it actually has more cargo space behind its rear seats than the Golf R does. Additionally, its interior quality shines over the Golf R\u2019s. The climate controls and screens are easier to operate and the seating position and materials and feel of higher quality. Even the rear seating is roomier in the Integra.\nWinner: Integra Type S\nDRIVING AND COMFORT\nThe Golf R provides a lot of all-around versatility. Its special all-wheel-drive system, besides providing extra traction for wintertime driving, also helps to sharpen the car\u2019s handling when powering out of turns. It also has a relatively comfortable ride over bumps and is pretty quiet on the highway. Both daily commuting and road trips are enjoyable with a Golf R.\nAcura\u2019s Integra Type S is also impressively civilized for daily driving. Yet it clearly stands out in the way it more directly involves the driver in the experience. The engaging handling and steering will make you seek out turns at every opportunity and the shifter has an enjoyable tactile feel. The Integra\u2019s transmission can also rev-match the engine to make downshifts quicker and easier.\nWinner: Integra Type S\nPRICING AND VALUE\nAcura starts the 2024 Integra Type S off at $51,995, including destination. Considering the driving experience, the price certainly seems fair. Nearly all of the Integra\u2019s available features come standard, including a premium audio system, a 9-inch center touchscreen, and a collection of advanced driver aids such as adaptive cruise control and blind-spot warning.\nThe 2024 Volkswagen Golf R also comes well equipped with a similar set of standard features as those on the Integra Type S. If you like ventilated front seats, then the Golf R will be your car; the Type S lacks them. The VW is also less expensive to start at $46,605.\nWinner: Golf R\nEDMUNDS SAYS\nIt\u2019s a close race, and both of these cars are excellent. If you go by which is the best to drive and live with every day, the Acura Integra Type S pulls ahead. It\u2019s a sharp-looking car that strikes a wonderful balance between sport compact and entry-level luxury. But buyers wanting an automatic transmission or all-weather utility will still find the Golf R a more agreeable option.\n____\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nChase Bierenkoven is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Twitter",

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electric-vehicles-hitting-road-block-201618345.html",
        "date": "2023-11-09T20:16:18.000Z",
        "text": "\nAs news started coming out about electric cars in early 2016, Michael Young, a self-described \"car guy,\" knew he wanted to try one. One afternoon, he strolled into his local dealership and asked to test drive the BMW i3, a small, sporty car with a range of up to 150 miles. The salesperson stopped him. \"You can't drive that car on the highway,\" Young recalls the salesperson saying, explaining that the car couldn't go over 45 miles per hour.\n\"I was kind of dumbfounded by that,\" Young said.\nSubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.\nYoung knew it could go much faster - and, after convincing the salesperson to let him go on a test drive, ultimately bought the i3. The experience motivated him to launch a website that helps consumers shop for electric vehicles.\nBut the incident underscores a problem that still plagues electric vehicles: Many U.S. buyers say car dealerships, which sell the majority of new vehicles, are not prepared for the electric transition. The Biden administration aims to have as many as two-thirds of new cars sold in the United States be electric by 2032; and automakers have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in EVs. But if car dealers don't want to sell EVs, the country's electric transition could be in jeopardy.\nCar sales are unlike any other commercial transaction in America. For most products - everything including shoes and iPhones - you can buy directly from the manufacturer or in dozens of other stores. Cars used to be the same: Before World War II, people bought personal vehicles at big-box department stores, from the manufacturers themselves and even at gas stations.\nBut in the 1940s and 1950s, dealerships - which were mostly single-family businesses - argued that the powerful automakers could undercut their sales and drive them out of business. Over the next two decades, dozens of states passed laws to protect dealers; many of them prevented manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.\nIn recent years, Tesla, which does not use car dealerships, has fought some of those laws in court. The company has won in some states and, in others, has received workarounds that allow a few select storefronts. Still, many automakers have to sell their vehicles through one of the country's more than 16,000 franchised auto dealerships. And those salespeople often don't have extensive training on how to sell an EV or even on the technology itself.\nFrustrated customers told The Washington Post that dealers tried to redirect their attention toward gas cars, or gave incorrect or unclear answers to questions about charging and day-to-day electric vehicle use.\nJames Richards, the CEO of a water heating company in Davis, Calif., spent days test-driving EVs at Volkswagen, Tesla, Chevy and Ford. But the 40-year-old found the dealership experience \"cringeworthy\" - the dealers didn't seem to know much about the EVs they were selling. \"I felt like I knew more than they did,\" Richards said.\nInitially, Richards was hoping to buy an F-150 Lightning, but the truck was back-ordered. The salesperson could only get him an expensive trim that came with a high dealer markup. That markup added \"insult to injury,\" Richards said. He ended up buying a Tesla Model Y. Tesla salespeople \"strike you as EV geeks,\" Richards explained. \"All the other dealerships: Ford, VW, the GM people - they didn't seem like specialists.\"\nMaya Batres, a 34-year-old adviser for an environmental organization, bought a used Fiat 500e from a dealer in February 2022. The dealer, she said, didn't know much about EVs but was happy to make the sale since she and her husband came prepared. But when it came time to sign the paperwork, the salesperson offered her a plan for oil changes and an extended warranty for a gas-powered car. \"I knew we didn't need that,\" Batres said, laughing.\nEVs are complex. There are three types of charging ports and three different speeds of charging for electric vehicles. (Young recalls a salesman telling him that he could use Tesla's charging network for a non-Tesla vehicle, long before the company began opening their fast chargers to other cars.) Electric cars also often come with new features like one-pedal driving and adaptive cruise control. Then there is the maze of federal and state tax incentives that can help drivers afford a new or used EV - but only if the dealer and the consumer can understand how they work.\nSome dealers, however, don't seem to want to offer electric cars: According to a survey that the Sierra Club conducted at the end of 2022, 66 percent of dealerships did not have an EV available for sale. That was at the height of EV supply chain problems, but 45 percent of those dealers - or 30 percent of all dealers surveyed - said they wouldn't offer an EV even if they could.\nAmid concern over an EV slowdown, electric cars are sitting longer on dealerships' lots than gas-powered cars. According to data from Cox Automotive, dealerships started the year with a roughly 50 days' supply of gas cars and electric cars. Now the supply of gas cars is around the same, but the supply of EVs has doubled.\nDealers may have less economic incentive to sell electric vehicles. Buzz Smith, a former Chevrolet car salesman who now helps train dealers to sell EVs, says it can take much longer to sell an electric car than a gas-powered one. A gas car, he said, might take no more than an hour in a single visit to sell, yielding a tidy commission.\nBut for electric vehicles, \"it was usually four visits, an hour each, before they would buy the EV,\" Smith said. Customers want to make sure they understand the technology, how to charge it and more. \"So I'm volunteering to take a 75 percent pay cut - and no salesman wants to do that.\"\nSmith said he believes the pay structure of auto salespeople isn't a good fit for the EV era. Electric cars have narrower profit margins, he said, which cuts into the commission a dealer can get. And if a customer returns to the dealership multiple times, salespeople may have to split the commission, again cutting into their take-home pay.\nAt the same time, car dealerships make most of their overall profits from providing service for vehicles - not selling new cars. According to an analysis from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 16 percent of dealers' gross profits came from new car sales, while 43 percent came from parts, labor and service. (The rest of the profits come from used car sales and financing and incentives.)\n\"It's a lot like giving away the razor to sell the blade,\" said Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who studies the laws and economics of car dealerships.\nThat could also discourage dealers from selling EVs. Gas cars have 100 times more moving parts than electric vehicles do, and studies show that EVs have lower maintenance costs. An average gas-powered car, for example, needs an oil change about every six months, or every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. But many electric cars don't require a major service until around 150,000 miles.\n\"They're all terrified of that loss of maintenance,\" Smith said.\nBut EVs are still new enough, Smith said, that customers will return to dealers because they don't want their neighborhood mechanic to try to service their car.\nSome dealers are working to embrace the new technology. Claire McDonald, the president of a Ford dealership in Waco, Tex., said her salespeople were excited to do the training that the automaker offered on how to sell EVs. \"It's a part of our future,\" she said.\nThey've only sold a dozen or so electric cars so far, she said, but she sees it as a key part of the business model going forward. \"I'm not here to push EVs, for or against,\" she added. \"I'm here to help our customers understand their needs.\"\nMike Stanton, the president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, says dealerships have invested around $6 billion in preparing to sell and service electric vehicles. \"Dealers have stepped up and done what is needed,\" he said.\nBut Stanton said the EV transition - especially with the Biden administration's aggressive goals on electric car sales - is moving too quickly. \"This is going way too far,\" Stanton said. \"We've got to consider the mainstream market, or bad things are going to happen.\"\nOthers - like Crane, who has submitted legal briefs supporting direct-to-consumer sales - say that the dealership-only model simply isn't suited for the electric future - and may add to a car's price tag.\n\"Dealers don't want to change the model,\" he said. \"They want to be the gatekeepers.\"\nRelated Content\nPanda diplomacy to live on?

The S&P 500 has now rallied for four weeks straight and up 8.7% on the month so far, which would be its best performance since mid-2022.\nThe Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation is due on Thursday and is expected to slow to its lowest since mid-2021, reinforcing market wagers that the next move in rates will be down.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will have a chance to push back against the doves at a Fireside Chat on Friday, and there are at least seven other Fed speakers on the docket this week.\n\"A view we hold strongly is that central banks are unlikely to deliver easing in the first half of 2024 absent a threat to the expansion or financial stability,\" agues Bruce Kasman, head of global economics at JPMorgan.\n\"Indeed, this message of patience is likely to be notable in upcoming DM policy communications in response to recent financial market developments.\"\nOIL HANGS ON OPEC+\nEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has also sounded in no hurry to ease and will have another opportunity to ram home the message at the EU parliament later on Monday.\nData on EU consumer prices for November is due Thursday and expected to show a cooling in both the headline and core rates, which would support market pricing for cuts.\nMarkets priced in almost 90 basis points of U.S. easing next year, and around 83 basis points for the ECB.\nThe chance of an easing in borrowing costs has generated a big rally in bonds, with yields on 10-year Treasuries down 37 basis points so far this month at 4.49%.\nThat in turn has been a drag on the dollar which has lost 3% on a basket of major counterparts this month.\nThe euro was up at $1.0940 on Monday, not far from its recent four-month high of $1.0965, while the dollar was holding steady at 149.53 yen.\nThe drop in yields has been a fillip for non-yielding gold which stood at $2,000 an ounce and near its October peak of $2,009.29.\nThe oil market faces a tense few days ahead of a meeting of OPEC+ on Nov. 30, a meting that had originally been slated for Sunday but was postponed as producers struggled to find a unanimous position.\nReports suggest African oil producers are seeking higher caps for 2024, while Saudi Arabia may extend its additional 1 million bpd voluntary production cut, which is due to expire at the end of December.\nThe uncertainty kept prices tight on Monday and Brent edged up 15 cents to $80.73 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 14 cents to $75.68 per barrel.\n(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

        "text": "\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Beyond the engineering, the athleticism, the speed, the luxury \u2014 fans love the sound of Formula One.\nThe fierce rhythms of a V6 turbocharged hybrid engine; the sticky staccato of a rushed downshift; sexy, loud zooms. There\u2019s a real musical appreciation for the elite motorsport. Engines are described using RPMs, the same way vinyl records are.\nIt is no wonder that F1 has long been an enthusiasm of musicians and music fans for decades \u2014 the Beatles \u2019 George Harrison wrote \u201cFaster\u201d about the series, what he called \u201ca noisy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u201d; the same spirit that inspired a Mario Andretti namecheck in A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s \u201cAward Tour.\u201d But in the last few years, an accelerating interest in F1, particularly among young Americans, has made its influence on the music world \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 impossible to ignore.\nThere\u2019s Bad Bunny \u2019s \u201cMonaco\u201d and Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cPor La Familia,\u201d both of which feature Red Bull driver Sergio \u201cCheco\u201d Perez in their videos. The up-and-coming indie twang band Wednesday released a track called \u201cFormula One\u201d on their 2023 album. Musicians loving F1 is limited to no genre and no country \u2014 its appeal is as global as the sport itself.\nA prime example is this week\u2019s inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix, which will see F1 drivers zipping down the strip, bathed in the electric glow of its opulent casinos. Music will mix with the motorsport at countless events beginning Wednesday, including an opening ceremony with will.i.am, J Balvin, Ti\u00ebsto, John Legend, Keith Urban, Kylie Minogue, Thirty Seconds to Mars and more.\nConcerts have become an expected addition to the F1 experience, and the trend has made its way stateside over the last decade.\nSince 2012, Circuit of The Americas in Austin, Texas, had been home to the sole U.S. F1 race \u2014 until the inclusion of Miami last year and Vegas in 2023. Glynn Wedgewood, COTA's senior vice president of music and entertainment, says the track first introduced live music performances with Elton John in 2015. Since then, Taylor Swift, Imagine Dragons and Pink have performed. By 2019, COTA was boasting three days of performances. 2023\u2019s lineup alone included The Killers, Queen with Adam Lambert and Ti\u00ebsto.\nThat lineup \u2014 which leans more rock-oriented for the COTA audience, compared to the Latin lineups of Miami, is \u201ca testament to what we\u2019ve seen over the past several years,\u201d Wedgewood says. \u201cIt's a young rock audience.\u201d\nWedgewood references the effects of Netflix's \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d, the popular docuseries that successfully altered the demographics traditionally associated with the world\u2019s most luxurious motorsport (older, wealthy, male) and opened it up to a younger generation \u2014 particularly Americans. In 2018, 265,000 people attended the COTA race. In 2023, that number jumped to 432,000. That translates to television viewership as well. According to ESPN, F1 viewership in 2022 jumped significantly among teenagers, women and the key 18-34-year-old demographic.\nThe connection between music and Formula One, for Wedgewood, is innate.\n\u201cThe majority of people listen to music in their car,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost subconsciously ingrained in our DNA \u2014 that racing goes hand-in-hand with music.\u201d\nThis year, will.i.am became Formula One\u2019s first Global Artist in Residence, which he pitched to Formula One Group CEO Stefano Domenicali as a series of musical collaborations celebrating the sport as well as an opportunity to bring the concert aspect of F1 to a global audience \u2014 not just the ticket holders lucky enough to see it live. The role led the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 member to release his first solo single in over a decade: \u201cThe Formula,\u201d featuring Lil Wayne. That was followed by \u201cLet\u2019s Go,\u201d another F1-inspired track, which features J Balvin.\nwill.i.am has been a huge F1 fan since the Peas performed at the first Singapore Grand Prix held at the Marina Bay Circuit in 2008. Since then, he\u2019s noticed a disconnect between the live music and entertainment experiences at F1 races and what's broadcast on TV \u2014 as well as missed opportunity for artists.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t people releasing music around the time they\u2019re playing their F1 event?\u201d he asks, comparing it to the Super Bowl \u2014 for which artists frequently release new music in advance of their (televised) halftime performances. \u201cArtists in Residency can really help bridge that gap.\u201d\nTi\u00ebsto, a lifelong F1 fan, released the album \u201cDrive\u201d in April, featuring an F1 racing helmet on the cover.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the car and racing, it\u2019s about the environment around it, the excitement around it,\u201d he says of a race weekend. \u201cThere\u2019s an organic connection there.\u201d\nHe believes the evolving experience of going to a Grand Prix mirrors growing interest in the sport, particularly in the U.S. and with young people.\n\u201cThey want to see the race, you know, but they want to party. They want to have a drink. It is the perfect moment to create a festival,\" he says.\nFormula One drivers, too, have been getting into music. Ferrari F1 driver Charles LeClerc signed with music management company Verdigris earlier this year and has been releasing instrumental compositions; Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time world champion, is no stranger to music making, having been featured on Christina Aguilera\u2019s 2018 track \u201cPipe\u201d under the pseudonym XNDA. Chloe Stroll, the sister of Aston Martin driver Lance Stroll, has built a nascent singer-songwriter career celebrated by the sport\u2019s fans.\n\u201cWhat made me like the sport was music. I went to the sport playing music,\u201d says will.i.am. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved cars, but why do I like F1 and not (IndyCar)? What is it about F1 that makes me like the sport? That is their tiptoe into this cultural hug,\" he says, referencing F1's embrace of fashion, music, and art.\n\"They see the value of different disciplines coming in, celebrating their sport,\u201d he added.\nThe modern marriage of F1 and music hasn\u2019t been without bumps. Despite the influx of new fans, watching races live remains an elite experience. The Vegas race is the most expensive event on this year\u2019s calendar \u2014 and it hasn't yet sold out. Last year\u2019s performance-laden pre-race show in Miami was met with distaste from the F1 drivers themselves who criticized the pomp and circumstance of the driver introductions \u2014 namely that they stood too long in the Florida sun in their uniforms during prep time.\nIn Vegas, the opening ceremony is being held on Wednesday. Driver introductions will take place on Saturday in advance of the race.\nOn Thursday night, producer Mark Ronson will perform at the T-Mobile Zone at the Sphere between two racing practice sessions. The mastermind behind the \u201cBarbie\u201d soundtrack already knows there\u2019s a big crossover between music fans and F1 fans.\nNow \u201cwe\u2019ll find out the cross-section of F1 and \u2018Barbie\u2019 fans,\u201d he jokes.",

The bondholder deal proposed they would be paid more than $700 million before 2026 in the base case, while official creditors had offered a longer three-year grace period.\nBondholders would need to offer more debt relief in the base case scenario for the deal to be acceptable to official creditors and the IMF, one of the sources said.\n\"There were marginal deviations in positions and these deviations are being discussed. As it stands, the IMF may be in a position to support the adjusted terms as compatible with Zambia's programme parameters,\" the second source added.\nA spokesperson for Zambia's finance ministry contacted on Wednesday pointed to a statement published on Tuesday that said there were \"continuing discussions\" with the group of bondholders, but that no further comment could be made as the negotiations are being held under Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).\nAn IMF spokesperson referred to a statement on Friday that said that \"modifications are needed to bring this initial proposal more fully into line with the requirements of the IMF program\" and declined to comment further.\nRepresentatives for the negotiating committee of the international bondholder group declined to comment and the Paris Club, which acts as a secretariat for developed creditor nations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nChina's foreign ministry said all creditors should offer debt relief \"in accordance with the principle of 'common action and fair burden',\" in faxed comments on Monday in response to Reuters questions about what the \"reservations\" on the bondholder deal were.

Now obviously shareholders have their rights and will exercise them in the appropriate venues, but this deal is the plan,\" he told reporters on Monday.\nThe TIM board approved the sale with 11 directors in favour and three against after meetings that stretched from Friday until Sunday evening.\nVivendi representatives quit TIM's board in January after a round of fruitless negotiations with the government on the future of the telecoms group.\nThe sale would allow TIM to reduce its financial debt by around 14 billion euros. Cash-burning TIM would also shed half of its 40,000 domestic staff and focus on its service operations.\nThe sale's 18.8 billion-euro price tag, including debt, could reach 22 billion euros if certain conditions are met, TIM said.\nTIM has mandated CEO Labriola to seek an improved deal for its Sparkle submarine unit. Sources said KKR valued the venture at around 650 million euros, while TIM is looking for a price tag of about a 1 billion euros.

Meanwhile, the BoE's Huw Pill said monetary policy would have to remain \"restrictive\" to push inflation back down to target.\nOther ECB officials on Wednesday made similar remarks, with Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel saying the \"last mile\" before inflation falls back to 2% - from the current 2.9% level - may be the hardest.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to talk at 1900 GMT at an International Monetary Fund conference in Washington, D.C.\nItaly's 10-year bond yield was last 4 bps higher at 4.523%, not far off a six-week low of 4.436% hit last week.\nGermany's 2-year bond yield, which is sensitive to expectations about ECB interest rates, was up 2 bps at 3.089%. It has fallen from a 15-year high of 3.393% in July.\nTraders in derivatives markets are betting that the ECB will cut rates by around 90 bps by the end of next year, from 4% currently. They expected roughly 60 bps of cuts at the start of October.\nJussi Hiljanen, head of rates strategy at lender SEB, said: \"2024 will be the real test on whether inflation continues to decline at a pace that warrants such early rate cuts that markets are pricing.\"\nHe said markets are \"too optimistic\" in their bets that rate cuts could start in April next year.\nPortugal's 10-year bond underperformed on Wednesday, a sign that investors are demanding a premium after Prime Minister Antonio Costa resigned amid a corruption investigation this week. Yet it was last broadly in line with the rest of the market with the yield up 4 bps at 3.398%.\nThe gap between Italy and Germany's 10-year yields was slightly wider at 187 bps. The spread, a gauge of investor confidence in the euro zone's more indebted countries, narrowed to its smallest since mid-September last week at 174 bps.\n(Reporting by Harry Robertson Editing by Bernadette Baum, Kirsten Donovan)",

And that dissension stems from...some of the members not wanting to continue cuts because they want to get some of their market share back,\" Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy told Yahoo Finance.\n\"The market is looking at that \u2014 saying you know what maybe there are members here who want to pull back on those cuts,\" he added.\nThis year's cuts are aimed at constraining global supply and keeping a floor under oil prices, which are down about 20% from the average price that prevailed in 2022.\n\"We see some scope for the group to do a deeper reduction, but we would anticipate that Saudi Arabia would seek additional barrels from other members to share the burden of the adjustment,\" wrote Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital, in a note this week.\nMarket fundamentals may also be contributing to uncertainty among OPEC+ members after a bearish oil market outlook was presented to the group this week. The materials from a top financial dealer reviewed by Reuters show November's recent sell-off was prompted by downbeat sentiment from oil producers and airlines.\n\"Raising the price in the face of softening demand could knock down demand further, resulting [in] lower prices regardless,\" noted the University of Houston's Hirs.\nOn Wednesday, government data showed US inventories rose by 8.7 million barrels last week to their highest level since July 21.\nA \"rollover of cuts and voluntary cuts will send the market south, for the current level of supply clamp is not enough to persuade the market that it is 'tight,'\" PVM oil broker John Evans said in a recent note. Wednesday's price reaction signaled skepticism that deeper cuts to output will materialize in 2024.\nCrude oil prices are down roughly 18% from 2023 highs reached in late September amid concerns of slowing demand and increasing supply.\nOn Tuesday, US senior adviser for energy Amos Hochstein told Yahoo Finance the Biden administration has been in \"close touch\" with oil producers, both in the US and abroad, including the Middle East.\n\"We understand their concerns,\" Hochstein said, \"but I think that increasingly they understand that high oil prices are bad for American and global consumers.

Now she is vowing to block one of the agency's controversial new crypto policies.\n\"I think the SEC is overreaching,\u201d she said during a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance this week.\nThe SEC is in the middle of an aggressive effort to rein in the crypto industry on a number of fronts, with lawsuits pending against a number of big players including Coinbase and Binance.\nOne of its policies that affects the industry \u2014 issued in March 2022 as \"Staff Accounting Bulletin 121\" \u2014 asks that any financial firms holding customers' crypto assets do so on their own balance sheets while warning investors about the risks of safeguarding those assets. The Government Accountability Office said this week that the SEC should have sent this policy guidance to Congress for its approval.\nLummis now vows to block it from becoming binding, citing it as another example of overreach by the SEC. Lummis, who believes she can garner support for this effort in the next few weeks in the Senate and the House, said the bulletin could hurt consumers if a digital asset custodian were to collapse.\n\"It's not a common-sense rule,\" Lummis told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview. \"It was issued as a staff bulletin, but the bulletin is binding.\"\nLummis said she is working on other fronts to provide the crypto industry with more clarity in Washington, including a sprawling piece of crypto legislation co-sponsored with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) that would outline how the sector is regulated.\nLummis said she is hopeful her legislation could pass in early 2024 and is open to taking pieces of the legislation and tucking it into other legislative packages.\nIn fact, that's what happened in recent weeks when a portion of her bill that deals with terrorist financing was tucked into the Senate's defense spending package, or National Defense Authorization Act. That legislation now getting ironed out with the House.\n\"It is something that is so clearly needed as illustrated by the concerns that Hamas is using cryptocurrency to help finance its savage treatment of Israeli civilians and military personnel,\" Lummis said. \"It would help.\"\nLummis said she also supports the House Financial Service Committee\u2019s crypto framework led by Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.).\nWhichever body is able to move legislation first, she said, is fine with her.\n\"Sen. Gillibrand and I see the small differences between the House and the Senate versions specifically related to stablecoins and we know they're resolvable,\" she said. \"So I think we're going to be able to get to a resolution on stablecoins now that the House has a new speaker and they're again open for business.\"\nLummis said she\u2019s been working with McHenry to get the stablecoin component of her bill moving. She added that she thinks they can iron out small differences and may be able to put something out before the end of the year.\n\"We're crying out for a clear regulatory framework here,\" said Lummis.\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTs\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

Traders have priced in an about 60% chance of a rate cut by the Fed at the June meeting compared to about 70% before Powell spoke, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nWhile this week has been light in terms of economic data, investors will get reports on consumer and producer prices as well as retail sales next week, which will further shape interest rate expectations ahead of the Fed's December meeting.\nThe University of Michigan is set to issue a preliminary reading on its consumer sentiment index for November at 10 a.m. ET.\nMegacap growth stocks Alphabet, Nvidia and Tesla fell between 0.5% and 1.5% in premarket trading.\nAmong individual stocks, Plug Power slumped 28.8% after the hydrogen fuel-cell firm's third-quarter revenue missed estimates.\nIllumina shares dropped 11.2% as the gene-testing company trimmed its full-year profit forecast for the second straight quarter.\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar; Editing by Maju Samuel)",

The Bank of England on Thursday also left rates unchanged.\nCentral bank officials however stressed that more may need to be done to tackle inflation.\nBenchmark 10-year yields fell as low as 4.527%, the lowest since Sept. 29. Two-year note yields reached 4.847%, the lowest since Sept. 1.\nA decision on Wednesday by the U.S. Treasury to issue less long-term debt than expected also fuelled the rally in bonds, as did data on Thursday suggesting the U.S. economy might finally be cooling.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 307.85 points, or 0.91%, to 34,146.93, the S&P 500 gained 55.68 points, or 1.29%, to 4,373.46 and the Nasdaq Composite added 225.03 points, or 1.69%, to 13,519.22.\nBucking the trend of the broader market, Apple shares were down 0.9%, a day after the company reported quarterly results and warned of a dull holiday quarter.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.17% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.44%.\nThe U.S. dollar index dropped to a six-week low after the jobs data.

Usually you'll see some sort of consolidation.\"\nMinutes from the Fed's latest meeting, released on Tuesday this week, could offer some colour on policymakers' thinking as they held rates steady for a second time this month.\nSterling was little changed at $1.2467, after earlier flirting with a near two-month peak.\nThe euro last bought $1.0926 ahead of flash PMI readings in the euro zone due this week and after Moody's unexpectedly upgraded the outlook on Italy's 'Baa3' sovereign rating to stable from negative and upgraded Portugal's rating by two notches to 'A3'.\nNordea's Cekov said the moves by Moody's should be a positive for the euro area as they should lead to a lower risk premium for Italian and Portuguese debt.\n\"In that sense it removes some of the downside risk for the euro. That's my first impression,\" Cekov said.\nThe Japanese yen remained on the stronger side of 150 per dollar and was last around 0.8% higher at 148.42.\nElsewhere in Asia, the yuan leapt to a more than three-month high against the dollar in both the onshore and offshore markets, as the central bank guided the unit higher and exporters rushed to convert their dollar receipts into local currency.\nThe onshore yuan and offshore yuan both rose to 7.1633 per dollar, their highest level since Aug. 4.\nThe Aussie was last 0.5% higher at $0.6547, having struck a three-month high of $0.6563 earlier in the session, while the kiwi gained 0.5% to $0.6022.\nChina on Monday left its benchmark lending rates unchanged at a monthly fixing, matching expectations, as a weaker yuan continued to limit further monetary easing and policymakers waited to see the effects of previous stimulus on credit demand.\nThe yuan, which has fallen nearly 4% against the dollar this year in the onshore market, continues to be pressured by a faltering economic recovery in China and as investor sentiment remains fragile.\n\"I think the theme of a soft Chinese economic recovery will persist for a while,\" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\"Until we get a more meaningful recovery in the Chinese economy, I think that will be a headwind for the (yuan), Aussie and the kiwi in the near term.\"\n(Reporting by Samuel Indyk and Rae Wee; Editing by Sam Holmes, William Maclean and Jan Harvey)",

With a petrol and diesel car ban nearing, the couple would consider an EV, but are put off by a lack of charging infrastructure, battery life fears and price.\nAutoTrader says new EVs in Britain are still on average 33% more expensive than fossil-fuel models.\nAnd most new models in the pipeline targeting entry-level consumers will not hit the market before 2025 at the earliest \u2013 by which time they will be contending with an expanded Chinese line-up from BYD to Nio in Europe.\n\"You want to do the right thing for the environment, but it feels like you're setting yourself up for a very expensive investment that will make your life that bit more complicated,\" Garcia, a 29-year-old corporate media director, said.\n\"We'll probably get a hybrid first\".\nFALLING BEHIND\nCritics have long warned that a lack of affordable EVs would eventually stall the steep sales growth boosted by early adopters and corporate fleets.\nA weaker performance in September, consumer sentiment surveys and bleak commentary from carmakers and dealers indicates that low growth era may have arrived.\nU.S. automakers, though further behind on the transition to EVs, are also feeling the pinch. Ford and GM warned recently they were delaying the launch of cheaper EV models and pulling back on spending due to weaker demand and higher costs in the wake of new United Auto Worker contracts.\nBut the problem is cyclical.\nDemand will remain slow for as long as there are no cheaper EVs available, Felipe Munoz of JATO Dynamics said of the slowdown in sales in Europe in September.\n\"From a regulatory standpoint, they don't have to push product out right now - they can afford to focus on profitability,\" said Alistair Bedwell, head of powertrain forecasting at GlobalData.\n\"But they need to have an eye on Tesla and the Chinese brands, because they don't want to get too far behind.\"\nIntention to buy an EV has stayed constant in Germany over the past year, a poll by consumer research firm The Langston Co showed - meaning that although the number of EVs being sold is rising, the number of people wanting to buy an EV is not.\nGrowing sales may simply be a sign that carmakers who were struggling to produce EVs because of supply chain bottlenecks can finally meet backed up orders, rather than a sign of rising demand, said The Langston Co's insights manager Ben DuCharme.\nPhilip Nothard, insight director at dealer services firm Cox Automotive, said low residual values also put buyers off as companies and many consumers choose new cars based on what they can sell them for a few years down the line.\n\"We call it the valley of death, which we will be going through in 2024 to 2027: low residual values, high supply, and low demand,\" Nothard added.\n(Reporting by Victoria Waldersee, Nick Carey; Additional reporting by Giulio Piovaccari in Rome, Paul Lienert in Detroit; Graphics by Sumanta Sen; Editing by Alexander Smith)",

A year ago, the rate averaged 6.95%.\nAs mortgage rates rise, they can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, limiting how much they can afford in a market already out of reach for many Americans. They also discourage homeowners who locked in far lower rates two years ago, when they were around 3%, from selling.\nThe combination of rising mortgage rates and home prices have weighed on sales of previously occupied U.S. homes, which fell in September for the fourth month in a row, grinding to their slowest pace in more than a decade.\nThe average rate on a 30-year home loan climbed above 6% in September 2022 and has remained above that threshold since. Rates have risen along with the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Fed does with interest rates can influence rates on home loans.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury had been rising in recent weeks, jumping to more than 5% last week, its highest level since 2007, as bond traders responded to signals from the Federal Reserve that the central bank might have to keep its key short-term rate higher for longer in order to tame inflation.\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opted against raising its main interest rate for a second straight policy meeting. That pulled bond yields lower, sending the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.63% late Wednesday. The yield was at 4.69% in afternoon trading Thursday. It was at roughly 3.50% in May and just 0.50% early in the pandemic.\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve again decided not to raise interest rates, but have not ruled out a hike before year-end,\u201d said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist. \"Coupled with geopolitical uncertainty, this ambiguity around monetary policy will likely have an impact on the overall economic landscape and may continue to stall improvements in the housing market.\u201d\nEven though the average rate on a 30-year mortgage remains below 8%, as calculated by Freddie Mac, it\u2019s merely an average. Many homebuyers are likely already being quoted 8% rates or higher on a home loan because rate quotes vary based on the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, home loan and other criteria.\nProspective homebuyers and sellers should expect the average rate on a 30-year home loan to remain close to 8% this month, before coming down slightly by the end of the year, said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.\n\u201cNo one should expect a dramatic drop in rates next year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a new era where the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage will remain around 7% through early next year before declining to 6% by the end of 2024.\u201d\nAmong the factors likely to keep upward pressure on mortgage rates is an expected increase in government-issued long-term bonds, such as 10-year U.S. Treasurys. While the Treasury Department said this week it would slow the pace of bond issuance, it\u2019s still expected to climb. The more bonds are issued, the higher their yield has to be in order to entice investors into buying up the extra supply. And higher yields on 10-year Treasurys tend to push up mortgage rates.\nAs rates have marched higher, home loan applications have slumped to their lowest level since 1995 in recent weeks, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\u201cMortgage applications declined for the third consecutive week as low inventory and high rates continue to stifle borrower demand,\" said MBA CEO Bob Broeksmit.\nTo cope, more prospective homebuyers are turning to adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs. Applications for ARMs jumped nearly 10% last week alone, the MBA said.\nMeanwhile, applications for mortgage refinancing loans sank last week to the lowest level since January.\nBorrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loan, held steady this week. The average rate was unchanged from last week at 7.03%. A year ago, it averaged 6.29%, Freddie Mac said.",

Cherney and Akash Sriram\nOct 24 (Reuters) - Google-parent Alphabet's cloud business crawled to its slowest in at least 11 quarters, sending the company's stock down 5.7% after hours, even as sales at rival Microsoft's cloud unit boomed.\nThe drop in Google\u2019s share price despite beating Wall Street estimates for profit and sales, shows how much investors want the company to deliver gains in artificial intelligence, and show the cloud business remains competitive against a more powerful Azure from Microsoft and Amazon.com\u2019s AWS.\nFears of a slowing global economy have prompted companies to curb spending on cloud-related services, including expensive AI tools, which has slowed revenue growth at Google's cloud unit to 22.5% in the third quarter, from 28% in the prior three-month period.\nGoogle Cloud third-quarter revenue rose 22.5% to $8.41 billion, the slowest growth since at least the first quarter of 2021. The cloud unit reported a operating income of $266 million, compared with an operating loss of $440 million a year ago. Wall Street expected cloud computing revenue of $8.62 billion.\nFinance chief Ruth Porat said in a conference call Tuesday that the third-quarter cloud growth is due to \"customer optimization efforts,\" without elaborating.\nBy contrast, revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses the Azure cloud computing platform, grew to $24.3 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $23.49 billion, LSEG data showed. Azure revenue rose 29%, higher than a 26.2% growth estimate from market research firm Visible Alpha. Microsoft shares rose 5% after hours.\n\"Despite Alphabet topping quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, investors were disappointed by the relatively weak performance at its Google cloud platform, which is at risk of falling further behind Azure and AWS,\" Investing.com senior analyst Jesse Cohen.\nWhile advertising spending has been strong in some sectors such as retail and travel, industry executives and analysts have noted a pullback in budgets in some areas, affecting Alphabet's major source of revenue.\nThe company recorded ad revenue of $59.65 billion in the third quarter, compared with $54.48 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $59.12 billion in revenue from its advertising business. Within the company's advertising segment, YouTube ads reported revenue of $7.95 billion compared with $7.07 billion last year.\nAlphabet reported a net profit of $19.69 billion for the July-Sept. period, compared with $13.91 billion a year earlier.\nRevenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 stood at $76.69 billion, compared with estimates of $75.97 billion, according to LSEG data.\nAlphabet laid off roughly than 12,000 employees earlier this year, or about 6% of its global workforce, in an effort to cut staff amid a \"different economic reality.\" The company also laid off employees from its global recruiting team in September.\nThe company disclosed that it recorded severance and related charges of $2.1 billion for the first nine months of the year.\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Max A.

        "text": "\n(Repeats for Asia morning readership. No change to text.)\nTAIPEI, Oct 25 (Reuters) - After mastering making iPhones, Taiwan's Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of major Apple supplier Foxconn, wanted to turn his entrepreneurial skills elsewhere - to be the island's next president.\nBut three months out from the election, Gou, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $6.7 billion, has gone to ground.\nHe last appeared at a campaign event on Sunday night, the day a Chinese newspaper said authorities had begun a tax probe into Foxconn's operations in China, even though he stepped back from running the world's largest contract manufacturer four years ago.\nHe cancelled a Monday event without explanation and had no public arrangements for Tuesday or Wednesday, unusual given the previous frequency of his rallies.\nThe tax investigation was first reported by the state-backed, strongly nationalist Chinese tabloid the Global Times, but in its English version of the story it suggested what China was actually unhappy with was Gou running for president as an independent, a decision he announced in August.\nThat was because, the paper said, Gou would split the opposition vote and \"in the end favour secessionist\" Taiwan Vice President Lai Ching-te, making his victory more certain.\nChina claims Taiwan as its own and believes Lai, who leads opinion polls, is a separatist bent on a formal declaration of independence. Lai says he will maintain the status quo and that only Taiwan's people can decide their future.\nSince the Global Times report came out, Gou's team has declined to comment, referring questions to Foxconn itself.\nGou, 72, has continued to post on his Facebook account, but not mentioned the probe.\nLate on Tuesday, Gou posted about late Apple founder Steve Jobs, whom he called his idol, and how he \"cherished\" their relationship even with often tricky requests when it came to making iPhones.\n\"If I had thought of quitting because Steve Jobs was too picky and the tasks given by Apple were too difficult, and had given up on doing Apple orders, I would have probably lost a great opportunity to participate in Apple's innovation in the future,\" he wrote.\n\"Think big, but don't lose sight of details - this is the personality trait I noticed in Jobs. This is the trait in recent years I have come to expect in myself and encourage in every colleague around me.\"\nFoxconn said in a statement on Sunday legal compliance was a \"fundamental principle\" of its operations, and it would \"actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations\".\n'TAIWAN'S CEO'\nGou has positioned himself as \"Taiwan's CEO\" saying he wants to unite a fractured opposition amid rising tensions with China, which he blames on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) hostility to Beijing.\nThe DPP-led government has repeatedly offered talks with Beijing, but been rebuffed, and has blamed China for the tensions.\nBut Gou has languished in the polls and the two main opposition parties, the Kuomintang and Taiwan People's Party, have instead been talking to each other about a possible joint ticket, though those talks have foundered.\nGou was not born wealthy. After graduating from university, he worked in a series of factory jobs, as Taiwan in the late 1960s and early 1970s began using its cheap labour force to churn out consumer goods for the rich Western world.\nHe founded Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, better known as Foxconn, in 1974 with 11 elderly workers and a $7,500 loan from his mother. He first made cheap plastic parts for black-and-white television sets for a Chicago TV manufacturer, before a major deal in 1980 making joystick connectors for Atari games consoles.\nIn 2000, Foxconn won an order to make Apple's redesigned iMacs, after making a variety of parts for the likes of U.S. personal computer vendor Dell.\nFoxconn eventually became one of the world's largest private-sector employers with at times over a million workers assembling devices for global brands such as Sony Corp, Nintendo Co Ltd and Microsoft Corp.\nGou remains a lauded figure at Foxconn after stepping down as chairman in 2019, referred to reverentially as \"the founder\".\nHis connections reached as high as Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he met in 2014 in Beijing, and whom in 2017 he described as a great leader, Taiwan media reported.\nGou's parents were born in China and were of the generation that fled to Taiwan after the Communists won China's civil war in 1949, a year before Gou's birth on the island.\nIn an interview with the Communist Party's official People's Daily in 2018 to mark China's 40th anniversary of landmark economic reform, Gou said he was happy to have witnessed the changes.\nEarlier this year, Gou vowed to start negotiations with China if he was elected president on the basis that both sides belong to one single China but each can interpret what that means.\nStill, in August when announcing his run he struck a tougher tone when asked if his Foxconn shareholdings meant China could simply tell him what to do if he became president.\n\"I have never been under the control of the People's Republic of China,\" he said. \"I don't follow their instructions.\"\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Sonali Paul)",

That could force the world to rely on as-yet-unproven carbon dioxide removal technologies to pull billions of tons of the planet-warming gas out of the atmosphere in a bid to lower global temperatures.\nOne thing is clear: Only truly radical transformations will prevent Earth from heating 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures, according to the report, which details 10 major new climate research insights. The world is currently on a dangerous trajectory to surpass the warming limit for at least a few decades.\n\u201cAs the crisis becomes stronger, so does the science and that means now we\u2019re able to attribute specific extreme weather events to greenhouse gases,\u201d said Aditi Mukherji, a co-author of the report and a principal researcher at the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t possible 10 or 15 years ago because the impacts were not so visible and clear.\u201d\nGlobal temperatures were around 1.4C (2.5F) above the pre-industrial average for the first 10 months of 2023. That makes this the hottest year on record, according to the United Nations. Greenhouse gas emissions continued increasing after hitting a historic high in 2022, with extreme weather events made worse by climate change killing thousands and displacing millions.\nRead More: What Is COP28 and Why Is It Important?\nKeeping global warming to relatively safe levels will require \u201ca rapid and managed fossil fuel phase-out,\u201d said the report, which was put together by research nonprofits Future Earth, The Earth League and the World Climate Research Programme. That means governments and the private sector need to stop pushing forward new fossil fuel projects, accelerate the early retirement of existing ones and rapidly increase renewable energy deployment.\nRemoving CO2 from the atmosphere is not a replacement for \u201crapid and deep emissions reductions,\u201d the scientists said. Rather, it\u2019s an added guardrail against the worst impacts of climate change. The world currently relies on forests to remove the bulk of carbon emissions put into the atmosphere, thanks to the ability of trees to absorb CO2.\nCapacity to remove carbon from the atmosphere needs to soar from about 2 billion metric tons of CO2 to at least 5 billion metric tons by 2050, the scientists said. (Other estimates put that number as high as 10 billion tons.) Only 0.1% of current removal comes from manmade technologies, but that ratio will need to increase.\nCarbon removal technologies ranging from using special rocks to machines are in their infancy and can only remove a few thousand tons of CO2 from the atmosphere annually. They\u2019ll need costs to come down and deployment to speed up.\nThat\u2019s partly because the role of so-called carbon sinks \u2014 the parts of the land and the oceans that absorb more carbon than they emit \u2014 might be negatively impacted as the planet warms, diminishing the capacity of natural ecosystems to remove CO2. Scientific research shows that major sinks, such as the oceans and the Amazon, are already capturing less CO2 than they used to and warming could degrade their ability further.\nA number of companies have made investments in carbon removal in an effort to help bring down costs. So, too, have governments. Notably, the Biden administration put more than $1 billion into research hubs to test carbon-removing machines earlier this year. That\u2019s part of a bid to ensure the US can reach its goal of net-zero emissions by mid-century, a target research shows the world will have to reach to keep 1.5C in reach.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep emitting and hope carbon removal will save the day \u2014 it won\u2019t,\u201d Mukherji said. \u201cIt will be one of the several tools on the kit, but the most important still remains cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nB-School Admissions Deans Are Feeling The Pressure From Falling Applications\nAnduril Builds a Tiny, Reusable Fighter Jet That Blows Up Drones\nNo Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

That meeting was billed as Hong Kong's comeback as a global financial hub following the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"The main question in the mind of everybody when they come to Hong Kong is how is the Chinese economy performing and what would be the swings coming from there,\" said Diana Parusheva-Lowery, head of public policy and sustainable finance at the Asia Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association in Hong Kong.\nThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange is only the 11th-largest venue for initial public offerings this year, with merely $2.7 billion raised through the third quarter, a shadow of its top position in most of the last decade. The territory's assets under management fell by 14% in 2022, official data showed.\nTrading volumes have also slumped as foreign investors reduce exposure to a China they view as increasingly isolated by its opaque policies, struggling property sector and crackdowns on private enterprise.\n\"The structural slowdown in China's economy, the omnipresent risk that U.S.-China relations might take another leg down in the future, the questions about whether private mainland money now prefers Singapore, none of that has really changed,\" said Chris Beddor, Gavekal Dragonomics' deputy China research director based in Hong Kong.\n\"And senior people in the financial sector are keenly aware of those issues, even if they don't discuss them publicly,\" Beddor said.\nSTRING OF LAYOFFS\nHong Kong's financial job market, which saw an exodus of foreign employees during COVID, is unlikely to recover in the near term amid a challenging operating environment, recruiters and industry insiders say.\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan have trimmed dozens of bankers based in Hong Kong and mainland China this year, with key China dealmakers among those laid off.\nThe surprise merger between Swiss banking rivals UBS and Credit Suisse resulted in a brutal 80% reduction in the Credit Suisse investment banking staff in Hong Kong in August.\nCanada's largest pension fund CPP Investments also cut a number of Hong Kong-based staff members.\nJohn Mullally, recruiter Robert Walters' Hong Kong managing director, said hiring in private banking remains active, helped by wealth coming out of China to Hong Kong after the border reopened.\nHong Kong needs to be aware of competition from rival financial hub Singapore but Mullally expects Hong Kong to \"regain some of the ground lost\" despite the depressed dealmaking and trading.\n(This story has been refiled to correct the spelling of CPP Investments in paragraph 13)\n(Reporting by Kane Wu in Hong Kong and Scott Murdoch in Sydney; additional reporting by Selena Li and Xie Yu; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)",

If that happens, Digital Prime expects ETF issuers will have a huge thirst for borrowing Bitcoin, and will jump start the fledging crypto-lending industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a rebirth of crypto lending,\u201d James Runnels, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview.\nFor example, if authorized participants need to create new inventory in the ETF, but Bitcoin\u2019s price suddenly jumps, they may chose to borrow the cryptocurrency, instead \u2014 and to buy it later at a lower price, Runnels said.\nWith ETFs, specialized traders known as authorized participants can work with an issuer to create shares when demand is building. When buyers\u2019 appetites cool, participants redeem those shares with the fund\u2019s sponsor to reduce the supply, keeping the ETF\u2019s price in line with its net-asset value.\nRunnels was a managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald, while Digital Prime\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Bob Sherry was COO for Prime Services at Cantor until 2018. Glen Garofalo, head of margin and risk solutions, was managing director of prime services, head of margin, at Cantor, according to his LinkedIn profile.\nDigital Prime\u2019s DLCC Prime subsidiary received Financial Industry Regulatory Authority membership last year, and can operate as a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

        "text": "\nBy Leika Kihara\nTOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese wholesale inflation slowed below 1% for the first time in just over 2-1/2-years in October, data showed on Monday, a sign that cost push pressures that had been driving up prices for a wide range of goods were starting to fade.\nThe slowdown in commodity-led inflation is in line with the Bank of Japan's projections, and puts the spotlight on whether wages and household spending would increase enough to generate a demand-driven rise in consumer prices, analysts say.\n\"Wholesale inflation seems to have cooled as past declines in raw material and energy costs filter through domestic business-to-business prices,\" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.\nThe effect of government subsidies to curb gasoline and utility bills will likely lead to a slowdown in consumer inflation by the close of the fiscal year ending March 2024, he said.\n\"But the pace of slowdown in consumer inflation will be modest as labour shortages and higher wages will underpin service prices,\" he said.\nThe corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, increased 0.8% in October from a year earlier, roughly matching a median market forecast for a 0.9% gain but cooling significantly from a 2.2% rise in September.\nThat marked the 10th straight month of slowing wholesale inflation with the year-on-year growth rate coming in below 1% for the first time since February 2021, the data showed.\nThe slowdown was due to declines in prices for wood, chemical and steel products, the data showed, highlighting the impact of falling global commodity costs.\nThe spike in wholesale inflation has prodded many Japanese firms to pass on higher costs to households, a trend that led the BOJ to upgrade its inflation forecasts in quarterly projections released in October.\nThe BOJ has said such cost-push inflation will dissipate, and must be replaced by price rises driven more by robust domestic demand in order for it to consider ending ultra-low interest rates.\nBOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has said Japan was making progress toward sustainably achieving the bank's 2% target, signalling that conditions for exiting ultra-easy policy were gradually falling in place.\n(Reporting by Leika KiharaEditing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes)",

Avolon has attracted potential interest from several industry players, though Bohai Leasing would only proceed with a sale if it can secure a good price, according to the people.\nThe Chinese group is also evaluating other alternatives such as selling its container leasing business Seaco, the people said. It hasn\u2019t decided which path to pursue, and it may also explore different ways to manage its debt load, according to the people.\nA group of creditors to Global Aircraft Leasing Co., the Bohai Leasing subsidiary that holds its Avolon stake, have been getting organized in anticipation of debt extension talks, Bloomberg News reported in September.\nLast month, Bohai Leasing attempted to refinance GALC\u2019s roughly $1.9 billion of existing notes due September 2024. GALC and Seaco\u2019s holding company tried to jointly issue $1.95 billion of new junk bonds to repay that debt.\nOrders were slow to come in as investors pushed for tighter protections, people with knowledge of the matter have said, and the offering didn\u2019t end up pricing. The new notes were marketed at an 11% yield, with a \u201cPIK toggle\u201d option ratcheting up the interest rate to 13% if the company makes payments with additional debt.\nThe surge in interest rates has made it more expensive for junk-rated companies like Bohai to refinance, with the yields on a global index of high-yield firms more than doubling since the start of 2022.\nBohai acquired Dublin-based Avolon in 2016. About a year later, Avolon tripled in size by acquiring CIT Group Inc.\u2019s plane-leasing business for more than $10 billion. Japanese financial firm Orix Corp. bought 30% of Avolon in 2018.\nDeliberations are ongoing, and Bohai Leasing could also decide to pursue other options such as divesting some of Avolon\u2019s plane portfolio, some of the people said.

But while many have perceived her rant to be about having to work, a closer listen shows it\u2019s really about having to commute to and from the office\u2014and what little time there is left in her day after that.\nThe TikTok video has racked up 228,000 likes since being posted on Oct. 19, with many viewers sympathetic to the poster, identified on the platform as Brielle. The X post mentioned above, from the account @TTEcclesBrown, has racked up 47 million views since being posted on Wednesday, with many responses deriding her.\nIn the video, the woman notes that remote work would solve her problem, as would affordable rent closer to her office.\n\u201cIf I was able to walk to work, it\u2019d be fine,\u201d she says, adding later, \u201cNothing to do with my job at all\u2026Being in the office 9-to-5, like, if it was remote, you\u2019d get off at 5, and you\u2019re home and everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\nInstead, she says, \u201cI get on the train at 7:30 and I don\u2019t get home till like 6:15 earliest.\" She complains that after her commute she doesn\u2019t have the time or energy to cook dinner or work out. She also wonders, \u201cHow do you have friends? How do you have time for, like, dating? Like I don\u2019t have time for anything, and I\u2019m like so stressed out.\u201d\nAs for why she doesn\u2019t live closer to work, she notes, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna be able to afford living in the city right now, so that\u2019s off the table.\u201d\nJason Calacanis, an angel investor and serial entrepreneur, mocked the woman for her complaints, writing on X: \u201cOh princess\u2026 I\u2019m sorry you had to commute and work and have a job and everything \u2014 it\u2019s like so extra!\u201d\nMany criticized Calacanis for his post, which itself has garnered 7.8 million views. But he was hardly alone in ridiculing the young woman.\n\u201cRecent college grad has breakdown over working a job. We\u2019re doomed,\u201d posted the Libs of TikTok account on X.\nOthers suggested ways in which the woman could improve her situation. On the site Ricochet, which bills itself as a \u201ccommunity for smart, civil conversation on the center right,\u201d a contributor with the handle \u201cSeawriter\u201d wrote:\n\u201cYou cannot have everything \u2014 not at once and not straight out of college. Decide what is most important to you and determine what you have to do \u2014 and what you have to sacrifice \u2014 to get it. Want to live in the city? Look for ways to make it affordable. Find a roommate or two roommates to split the cost of an apartment \u2014 live two or three to a room. Don\u2019t want a long commute and don\u2019t want to share a room? Get a job in the suburbs.\u201d\nThe woman is hardly alone, however, in being frustrated with commuting. With more CEOs demanding workers return to the office, many Americans are asking why the routine is necessary, especially given that remote work sufficed during the pandemic.\nIn a recent survey of over 8,400 U.S. workers by FlexJobs, 63% of respondents said remote work was still the most important part of a job to them, ahead of salary and a good boss.\n\"The tightly closed Pandora\u2019s box of \u2018work from anywhere\u2019 has burst open, and will never be resealed,\" Expensify CEO David Barrett wrote in a blog post this week after running a return-to-office experiment involving a upscale lounge for employees. \"No amount of begging or coercion is going to work in the long run: The businesses that demand it are fighting a losing war of attrition.\"\nOffice attendance in large cities, meanwhile, is still only about half the level seen in 2019, as the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. That\u2019s despite a slight uptick in attendance coupled with tough talk from high-profile CEOs about enforcing return-to-office policies.\nIn an email to Insider, Brielle wrote that while she's grateful to have her corporate job in the New York area after five months of post-college searching, \u201cit is discouraging and understandable why Americans are burnt out and mental illness levels are high.\u201d She also worries about office workers not finding enough time to enjoy \"sunlight, exercise, adequate sleep, healthy eating, and forming connections with other people.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "text": "\nA five-day boardroom drama at OpenAI ended Wednesday with the return of CEO Sam Altman and an overhaul of the board. The lesson that will linger is the importance of governance to the stability of any company.\nFour directors were able to sack the co-founder of the pioneering artificial intelligence startup without any input from investors, walking the company into a legal morass and stirring the ire of many OpenAI employees who demanded that the board resign.\nThe reason this happened, said Case Western Reserve School of Law corporate law professor Anat Alon-Beck, was a predictable \"mess\" created by OpenAI\u2019s \"very unusual\" corporate structure.\n\"I would hope that they learned their lesson and will now go ahead and fix this corporate governance mess. Otherwise, history will repeat itself very soon.\"\nTo understand what happened, it helps to go back to 2015, when OpenAI was first established. It began as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of advancing humanity instead of pursuing profits.\nIn 2019 Altman and his team did create a for-profit subsidiary to raise outside venture capital \u2014 including billions from Microsoft (MSFT).\nThat complicated things. It was structured in such a way that the for-profit subsidiary remained under the control of the nonprofit and its board of directors, while giving its biggest backer (Microsoft) no board seats and no voting power.\nIf there was any doubt about who was in control, OpenAI even said on its website that \"it would be wise to view an investment in OpenAI Global, LLC in the spirit of a donation.\"\nThe inherent tension between these two parts of the enterprise is what contributed to the dramatic events of the last week, starting Friday with the surprise ouster of Altman.\nThe collective decision came from four directors: OpenAI\u2019s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever; Quora co-founder Adam D\u2019Angelo; tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley; and Helen Toner, a director with Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\nThe directors said in a statement that Altman \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\"\nThe board-CEO clash was bound to develop, Alon-Beck said, because of the \"misalignment of incentives\" that resulted from the layering of nonprofit and for-profit entities.\n\"I was not supportive of [OpenAI] adopting these new charters for several reasons,\" Alon-Beck said. \"And we can see the mess now right, we can see the mess at OpenAI. And that's exactly what I was afraid was going to happen.\"\nThere were reports following Altman\u2019s ouster that some investors were in fact exploring legal action against the board. Employees also made it clear they were unhappy, with many signing a letter threatening to leave unless Altman returned.\nPrior to Altman\u2019s initial termination, the company\u2019s 700-plus workers had been anticipating a tender offer allowing them to sell their shares and reportedly valuing the startup at $86 billion. Absent Altman, that valuation was expected to dwindle.\nDid these implied threats influence the eventual outcome?\nIt is not yet known why some directors changed their minds. As overseers of a nonprofit, they typically wouldn't face the same legal vulnerability as for-profit board members because maximizing profits was not their top priority, said University of Virginia law professor and corporate structure expert Michal Barzuza.\nBut had they stayed the course, experts said, these board members would have faced significant legal pressure from investors, employees, state attorneys general, and possibly even Altman.\nThe fallout from firing Altman exposed them to potential claims that the board had breached its fiduciary duties to both the nonprofit and its for-profit subsidiary by failing to meet legal responsibilities known as the \"duty of loyalty and the duty of care.\"\nAny board, she added, is required to make informed decisions, to make a good effort to receive all relevant information, to deliberate, and to consult with experts to make the best decision that is in the benefit of the corporation.\n\"So if the board was very quick to make decisions, or if the board didn't have sufficient information and didn't try to get all relevant information, that could be one basis for [a lawsuit].\u201d\nWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo.\n\nWe are collaborating to figure out the details. Thank you so much for your patience through this.\n\u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) November 22, 2023\nOpenAI will now have a new board that won\u2019t include three of the four board members who made the decision to oust Altman.\nNew directors include Bret Taylor, the former co-CEO of Salesforce; former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and D\u2019Angelo, the only person from the former board to stay. Taylor will be chair. Altman will not be on the new board.\nThere were reports that more directors could still be added, and that Microsoft could still have board representation as well. It\u2019s also possible that Altman could join the board eventually. Microsoft owns 49% of OpenAI\u2019s for-profit arm.\ni love openai, and everything i\u2019ve done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together. when i decided to join msft on sun evening, it was clear that was the best path for me and the team. with the new board and w satya\u2019s support, i\u2019m\u2026\n\u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 22, 2023\n\"The former now infamous board members are finally gone after the failed coup and now in essence OpenAI will be virtually the same than before this soap opera began,\" Dan Ives, a technology analyst for Wedbush, said in a note Wednesday.\nHowever, he added, it \"will have a much stronger governance now in place which is key.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- The Riksbank paused its tightening campaign, refraining from inflicting a ninth increase in borrowing costs on an increasingly sickly Swedish economy.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nOpenAI Engineers Earning $800,000 a Year Turn Rare Skillset Into Leverage\nHulu for $1, Max for $3: Streaming Services Slash Prices This Black Friday\nAltman Returns as OpenAI CEO in Chaotic Win for Microsoft\nMcKinsey and Its Peers Are Facing the Wildest Headwinds in Years\nIsrael-Hamas War Truce to Begin Friday Morning, Qatar Says\nPolicymakers led by Governor Erik Thedeen left the benchmark interest rate at 4%, in a decision that had split economists. A majority predicted a hike, though eight out of 21 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg anticipated no change.\nThe central bank underscored the dampening impact of monetary policy on demand and inflation pressures and said it would be prepared to raise its key rate further if needed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear we have not lost the chance to hike again,\u201d Thedeen said at a news conference in Jonkoping, where the board met this time. \u201cWe will do that if inflation does not go in the right direction toward 2%. That is a very clear message from us.\u201d\nThe decision aligns Sweden\u2019s central bank with peers in the US, euro zone and the UK that have already halted for now. Officials opted not to squeeze the economy further even as the krona\u2019s feebleness risks importing more cost pressures and services price growth remain elevated.\nThe currency weakened as much as 0.5% after the decision to 11.4515 against the euro at 11:40 a.m. in Stockholm.\nThe Riksbank still sought to indicate a tightening bias to investors.\n\u201cThe forecast for the policy rate is that it may be raised further at the start of next year and that monetary policy needs to be contractionary for a relatively long period of time,\u201d officials said. That chimes with global counterparts that have signaled borrowing costs will need to stay higher for longer.\nIt was also interpreted by analysts as more of a signal than a concrete plan to jack up the cost of credit further.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\u201cThe Riksbank\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold on Thursday confirms it is done hiking for this cycle \u2014 the accompanying hawkish tone is likely to ensure financial conditions do not ease prematurely and will also support the recent strengthening in the krona. The central bank\u2019s next move will probably be a cut in the second half of 2024.\u201d\n\u2014Selva Bahar Baziki, economist\nThe central bank\u2019s policy path implies a peak at 4.1% in April, with reductions starting in the spring of 2025.\n\u201cWe expect that the Riksbank is now done hiking and forecast the first rate cut in June 2024,\u201d Swedbank AB analysts Jesper Hansson, Carl Nilsson and Glenn Nielsen said in a note. \u201cWe don\u2019t think another hike will come, as greater disinflation and a weak economy going forward will lower the need for this.\u201d\nThe Riksbank\u2019s easing will begin sooner than the rate path implies due to the deteriorating economy and as consumer-price growth is seen reaching levels consistent with the central bank\u2019s target \u201calready next summer,\u201d they said.\n\u201cThey are buying themselves time through a hawkish framing,\u201d portfolio manager Thomas Pohjanen at Excalibur Asset Management said by email. Waiting until the next meeting on Jan. 31 \u201cwill give the bank clues that will guide that decision,\u201d he said. The outcome will be communicated Feb. 1.\nThe case cited by economists for a ninth hike was stubbornly high inflation, and the vulnerability of the Swedish krona to setbacks after recent strengthening. Analysts acknowledged however that weak economic data and the currency\u2019s recent strengthening also supported arguments for a pause.\nThe Riksbank is also considering increasing the pace of sales of government bonds, and said it could make a decision on the matter in January. The Riksbank has no plans to begin selling its holdings of non-government bonds, it said.\nTightening started in April last year. The mounting fallout includes a dent in consumption, a plunge in housing construction and a squeeze on some highly leveraged property owners that are struggling to refinance maturing debt.\nThedeen said the troubles of some landlords had no direct impact on the rate decision, and added that the bank hasn\u2019t discussed any measures to alleviate pressure on the sector.\n\u201cIt is up to the companies to handle their balance sheets and there\u2019s still plenty of room to do that,\u201d Thedeen said. \u201cThey cannot count on support from us.\u201d\nEven the hitherto resilient labor market is now weakening, and the central bank has come under pressure from labor unions as well as employers\u2019 organizations warning that increasing borrow costs further could harm the nation\u2019s economy unnecessarily.\nThe Riksbank now expects a 0.7% decline in gross domestic product this year, followed by a contraction of 0.2% in 2024.\n--With assistance from Love Liman, Ott Ummelas, Harumi Ichikura, Joel Rinneby, Veronica Ek, Christopher Jungstedt, Stephen Treloar, Charles Daly and Lars Klemming.\n(Updates with comments from governor, economist and portfolio manager from fourth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Elon Musk Spent Three Years Falling Down a Red-Pilled Rabbit Hole\nThe Utah Jazz Enter Their Experimental Post-Cable Phase\nX Scrambles to Minimize Damage From Antisemitic Posts\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving\nGuatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

It is our duty to grab the collars of murderers,\" he said.\n\"Rest assured, we are doing much more than what is seen about what is happening in Gaza, and we will continue to do so. We will not leave our siblings in Gaza unattended, hopeless,\" he said, without elaborating.\nTurkey had previously said it was in talks with Hamas on the release of hostages it captured on its Oct. 7 assault on Israel, but it has not disclosed any progress on that effort publicly. Ankara has also sent more than 200 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Egypt for Gazans.\nOn Monday, Fidan will meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Ankara for talks on Gaza.

Xi said China wants friendship with the US and that his nation won\u2019t fight a war with anyone, among his clearest remarks yet proclaiming a desire for peaceful ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies.

Biden and Xi agreed that Beijing will crack down on companies that make the chemicals that are its raw ingredients. The ubiquitous street drug that\u2019s 50 times more powerful than heroin has been driving record rates of fatal overdoses stateside. Biden also said the US and Mexico were working to address the challenges posed by fentanyl trafficking as well as migration and border security.\nThe S&P 500 rallied for a third straight week, no doubt boosting the mood of 401k holders. The dollar saw its worst week in four months amid thinking that the currency has already peaked, with softer-than-expected economic data reinforcing bets the Fed is done with rate hikes. \u201cThe lesson of the past few years is that all good investors must be humble in their economic projections,\u201d said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\nEarnings season ends next week and profits have clocked in around 4% higher year-over-year.

But does only using physical currency truly curb impulsive purchasing and increase financial mindfulness? Or is it just really, really inconvenient? Or both?\nNext: 10 Frugal Money Habits That You Need to Embrace\nFind Out: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday Purchases\nGOBankingRates asked three professionals who embraced short-term cash-only lifestyles what they learned from the money experiment. Here\u2019s what happened when they kicked their credit cards to the curb and went all-in on cash.\nSponsored: Open a new checking account and earn early paycheck access; up to 2 days early with Discover\u00ae Cashback Debit with Early Pay\nAll of the people we talked to found that going completely cash-only can curb impulsive spending by creating a psychological deterrent.\n\u201cUsing cash for all transactions brought a psychological aspect to spending that I hadn\u2019t considered before,\u201d said Olivia Stettler, who went cash-only for a month. \u201cThe tactile experience of handing over physical money made each purchase feel more significant, leading to more thoughtful spending decisions.\u201d\nRichmond Harris, cash-only for a year, felt the same. \u201cWhen you see physical bills leaving your wallet, it\u2019s harder to part with them,\u201d he said. \u201cTemptation to spend impulsively dwindled. Counting out physical money adds a mindful layer many find beneficial for reducing wasteful spending.\nI\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here Are 3 Things I Never Waste Money On\nBoth Stettler and Joe Manktelow-Pimm, who tried going cash-only for six months, say it\u2019s tough to stick to a cash budget. To keep herself on the right path, Stettler used a simple method called the envelope system. She divided her spending into different categories, like groceries, entertainment, and bills. Then, she put a specific amount of cash for each category into separate envelopes.\nStettler found this system extremely helpful. It helped her stay on budget and, even more importantly, it made her more aware of her spending habits.\n\u201cThis simple yet effective method kept me on track and made me more aware of my spending habits,\u201d she said.\nThe idea is that when you see the actual cash in the envelope, it makes you think twice before spending it. It\u2019s like a reality check for your budget, making you consider if you really need to spend that money.\nUsing only cash has a big advantage, as Manktelow-Pimm pointed out: \u201cWhen you use cash, you don\u2019t have to worry about interest charges on credit cards or loans. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.\u201d\nIn simple terms, if you stick to cash, you won\u2019t have to pay extra money in interest fees, which can add up if you use credit cards or loans.\nAvoiding interest charges is a big plus, but it\u2019s essential to weigh the pros and cons and consider your own financial habits and needs before going cash-only.\nCash-only living, as Manktelow-Pimm pointed out, carries its share of drawbacks. \u201cWhen you use cash, you are limited to the amount of money you have on hand,\u201d he said.\nThis restriction can become a big disadvantage when you encounter an unexpected major purchase. With no credit or debit cards as fallback options, your spending becomes strictly confined to the physical currency in your wallet. This constraint can complicate larger purchases or emergencies, which mean an inconvenient trip to an ATM, along with the associated fees. You\u2019ll have to plan ahead and have a well-stocked emergency fund if you\u2019re going cash only.\nPlus, in some situations, like when you\u2019re shopping online or paying bills, using cash can be downright impossible.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hassle in the digital age,\u201d said Harris. \u201cOnline shopping or subscriptions become cumbersome.\u201d\nManktelow-Pimm observed the difficulty of keeping tabs on expenses when using cash during his six-month experiment.\n\u201cIt can be challenging to keep track of your expenses when you use cash,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to keep receipts and manually record your spending, which can be time-consuming.\u201d\nManaging your finances this way requires a great deal of discipline, particularly since you lack the convenience of relying on readily available bank statements.\nAnd cash-only living provides no credit boost, Manktelow-Pimm found.\n\u201cUsing cash does not improve your credit score since you are not using credit,\u201d he said.\nWhile short stints of cash-only living can increase mindfulness, lengthy experiments can come with serious hassles.

It will pay HK$9.35 a share, a 29% premium to Wednesday\u2019s closing price, according to a filing.\nThe investment will bring \u201clongterm stable financial returns\u201d as it expects to share the profits of Citic Ltd. which earned HK$75.5 billion of net income in 2022, Huarong said in the filing.\nThe move is expected to beef up Huarong\u2019s ties with Citic Group, a state-run financial conglomerate that led a $6.6 billion government-orchestrated bailout of the bad bank in 2021. It\u2019ll also lift investor confidence over Huarong\u2019s financial strength that had battered its shares and bonds.\nThe stake purchase shows that Huarong is working closely with Citic Group as a whole, and that state support is high, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Timothy Tan.\nHuarong plans to change its name to China Citic Financial Asset Management Co. Huarong also updated its progress on slimming down its business, saying it completed the disposal of equity interests in five licensed subsidiaries, according to another exchange statement. The sales realized a gain of 3.5 billion yuan ($483 million).\nHuarong\u2019s dollar bonds rallied Thursday morning. The spread for a 4.75% note due 2027 narrowed 157 basis points to 270 basis points, on pace for its tightest level since April 2022, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Huarong shares jumped 12% as of the lunch break in Hong Kong, while Citic Ltd. ended the morning session unchanged, paring gains of as much as 1.8%.\nThe change \u201cis good for market sentiment and from a technical perspective,\u201d said Ting Meng, a senior credit strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. \u201cIt could enable onshore investors to invest in Huarong under Citic Group line.\u201d\nHuarong rattled Asian credit markets in 2021 after it failed to release its annual report on time, eventually revealing a massive loss for 2020. Citic Group later stepped in with the bailout and overtook the finance ministry as its largest shareholder.

        "text": "\nPricing for the average new car continues to rise, with the latest reports pegging the average new vehicle transaction price around $48,000. High interest rates are a further impediment for shoppers on a tight budget. While buying used is always an option, there are some great new cars out there that are still affordably priced. The automotive experts at Edmunds have selected five standout vehicles with starting prices less than $30,000.\nWhile there are other less expensive vehicles on the market, oftentimes spending a little more will get you a much more desirable vehicle over the long term. Edmunds took into account qualities such as comfort, fuel economy, driver assist features and practicality. All of the manufacturer suggested retail prices below include destination charges.\nSMALL CAR: HONDA CIVIC\nAvailable as a sedan or hatchback, the Honda Civic boasts roomy seating, high fuel economy, and a pleasing amount of standard features even on the base LX trim level. The Civic EX sedan and Civic EX-L hatchback, both of which still fit under our price cap, have a turbocharged engine that provides smooth power for city driving.\nOf the two versions, the Civic hatchback is the better buy for practicality. It offers 25 cubic feet of space behind its rear seats, which is about 10 more cubes than the sedan\u2019s trunk. Downsides to the Civic are few but include a somewhat noisy cabin at highway speeds and some driver assistance features that could operate a little more smoothly.\nStarting price: $25,045\nMIDSIZE SEDAN: KIA K5\nThe Kia K5 is a relatively new model that competes with a number of more well-known rivals, including the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. But this sedan stands out with its distinctive styling and affordable price. It\u2019s also quiet and comfortable on the highway and has easy-to-use controls and technology features.\nStarting with the base LXS trim still gets you an appealing amount of convenience features, plus a 180-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine provides reasonable pep and good fuel economy. Upgrading to the GT-Line trim allows you to add all-wheel drive and still stay very close to our $30,000 limit. One drawback to the K5\u2019s sporty styling is that its sloped roofline can make it a bit difficult to get in and out of the back.\nStarting price: $26,515\nSMALL COUPE: SUBARU BRZ\nThe Subaru BRZ is a textbook example of a fun-to-drive sport coupe. Unlike most other new vehicles on sale today, it\u2019s lightweight and lively and provides a great handling feel of the road. The BRZ\u2019s 228-horsepower four-cylinder engine is powerful enough to make you smile but not so much that you\u2019ll constantly be at risk for speeding tickets like you can with more powerful cars.\nAs you might expect from a diminutive sport coupe, the BRZ\u2019s rear seats are very small, and its ride quality can get a little uncomfortable over bumps and ruts. But these will be minor drawbacks for the right buyer. Also note that Toyota\u2019s GR86 is essentially the same car but with subtle differences. Of the two, Edmunds prefers the BRZ.\nStarting MSRP: $29,615\nELECTRIC CAR: CHEVROLET BOLT EV\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV isn\u2019t necessarily an electric vehicle you will get excited about. Other models are more stylish and powerful. But for all-around value the Bolt is tough to beat. This small hatchback offers a respectable EPA-estimated range of 259 miles on a full charge, and Edmunds found from its own testing that the Bolt can go farther than that in real-world driving.\nOther advantages to the Bolt include roomy seating considering its small overall size, an easy-to-park nature, and a decent collection of standard features. The base 1LT trim equipped with some optional features such as heated seats will still be less than $30,000. However, the Bolt isn\u2019t the best for long road trips because of its relatively slow DC charging capability.\nStarting MSRP: $27,495\nHYBRID CAR: HYUNDAI SONATA HYBRID\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about this stylish hybrid. To start off, it can get up to an EPA-estimated 52 mpg, which isn\u2019t too far off from the Toyota Prius\u2019 mpg estimate. On top of that, the Sonata Hybrid delivers a lot of value for your money. Even the base Blue trim comes with many helpful driver assist features such as traffic-adaptive cruise control, a lane-keeping system, and a blind-spot warning system with automatic intervention.\nAs with the regular Sonata, the hybrid has roomy front and rear seating and a no-fuss control layout. There\u2019s little compromise in acceleration and trunk space as well. Lackluster comfort on long drives is the biggest drawback to this otherwise well-rounded hybrid.\nStarting MSRP: $29,565\nEDMUNDS SAYS:\nBuying a low-priced car doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to settle for a subpar vehicle. An entry-level trim of any of our above vehicles will be an excellent choice for value.\n_______\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nNick Kurczewski is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Twitter and Instagram",

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Lakshmi Mittal\u2019s younger brother is effectively getting a helping hand \u2014 and a possible way out of financial distress \u2014 from Nigerian taxpayers, after the country\u2019s government agreed to pay his company almost $500 million to settle a contract dispute over a deal that a previous administration said was tarnished by fraud.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAston Martin Owner Lawrence Stroll Sells F1 Team Stake at \u00a31 Billion Valuation\nBacklash Spreads Over Musk\u2019s Endorsement of Antisemitic Post\nHamas Mastermind Who Tricked Israel Is Top Target in Gaza Tunnels\nApple Plans to Make It Easier to Text Between iPhones and Androids\nApple\u2019s Effort to Replace Qualcomm Chip in iPhone Falls Further Behind\nPramod Mittal, whose career in the steel industry has been less glittering than his better-known sibling \u2014 the tycoon behind the \u20ac20 billion ($21.2 billion) ArcelorMittal SA conglomerate \u2014, has a string of abandoned factories and a trail of unpaid debts to his name. Five years ago, his Isle of Man-registered Global Steel Holdings Ltd., or GSH, was put into liquidation over $167 million owed to Moorgate Industries Ltd., a company spun off from one of the world\u2019s biggest steel traders.\nAs a UK court weighed Moorgate\u2019s request to declare Pramod personally bankrupt three years ago, the London-based Indian national held out the prospect of a payout from the Nigerian state to clear his debt. The judge was unconvinced at the time, but the settlement subsequently reached with Nigeria last year now looks like the 67-year-old\u2019s best route out of insolvency. Still, while payments from the Nigerian government have reached GSH\u2019s liquidators, as of Oct. 4, Moorgate had yet to see any of those funds despite having asked for them, court documents show.\nWith Pramod\u2019s bankruptcy winding its way through English court rooms, a new Nigerian president has taken office, and last month his steel minister said one of the administration\u2019s top priorities is to finally fire up the furnaces of the massive plant at the heart of the younger Mittal\u2019s $496 million compensation. The government has justified the agreement with a former unit of Pramod\u2019s GSH, which was announced in September 2022, saying it frees the state to pursue its ambitions for the sprawling 24,000-hectare (92 square mile) site.\nThe settlement \u2014 representing about 1.5% of Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves \u2014 is just the latest twist in the saga of the vast Soviet-built factory complex begun 44 years ago. The project has sucked up more than $7 billion in public investment and has yet to produce any metal. The story of the Ajaokuta steel mill on the banks of the Niger River 190 kilometers south of the capital, Abuja, is often cited as emblematic of the corruption, poor governance and incompetence that bedevils the West African nation. The country\u2019s most notorious white elephant still sparks passionate debate over whether it should be written off or revived.\n\u201cAjaokuta has been a black hole that has gobbled up billions of dollars, enriching multiple generations of politicians and foreign enablers,\u201d says Matthew Page, a former Nigeria expert for US intelligence agencies and now an associate fellow at London-based Chatham House. \u201cThis last failed reboot \u2014 and the giant price tag that came with it \u2014 is a preview of the next failed re-concessioning attempt. At this point, Ajaokuta\u2019s dilapidated machinery is capable of doing only one thing: making public funds disappear.\u201d\nNeither Pramod\u2019s representatives nor the spokespeople for the newly elected President Bola Tinubu and Steel Minister Shuaibu Audu responded to requests for comment. Abubakar Malami, Nigeria\u2019s attorney general from 2015 to earlier this year, on whose watch the settlement was reached, said last year that the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari \u201crescued the steel industry from interminable and complex disputes as well as saving the taxpayer from humongous damages.\u201d\nPramod\u2019s Involvement\nPramod entered into the Ajaokuta picture in 2004, when then President Olusegun Obasanjo awarded GSH a series of contracts, including an arrangement first to manage and later to buy the steel mill.\nShortly after GSH took over the plant, Solgas Energy Ltd., a small US company, sued it in Texas. Solgas claimed that GSH discussed becoming Solgas\u2019 subcontractor on Ajaokuta before breaching a confidentiality accord and bribing Nigerian officials, including one of Obasanjo\u2019s sons, to \u201csteal the concession.\u201d While the case was thrown out on jurisdictional grounds, in December 2008 a separate arbitration tribunal ordered Nigeria to pay Solgas $15.2 million in damages for the wrongful termination of the contract \u2014 while noting the US firm hadn\u2019t provided evidence to support the corruption allegations.\nBy then, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua had taken over as Nigeria\u2019s president, and he canceled GSH\u2019s contracts after a panel that his steel development minister set up said the concessions were rife with irregularities. GSH\u2019s claim it had invested $200 million was \u201ca ruse,\u201d the inspectors said. Rather, the company had used its Nigerian assets to borrow more than $192 million from local banks \u2014 funds they \u201cstrongly\u201d suspected had been dispatched abroad, they said.\nThe panel\u2019s full report \u2014 never made public but seen by Bloomberg \u2014 said rescuing Ajaokuta was beyond the \u201cfinancial, technical and experiential capabilities\u201d of GSH, which instead had been \u201csystematically cannibalizing, vandalizing and moving valuable equipment\u201d out of the factory. GSH and its Nigerian unit initiated arbitration proceedings against the government and later entered mediation, which produced last year\u2019s settlement.\nPramod had signed two earlier agreements with the Nigerian government \u2013 in 2014 and 2016 \u2013 that would have seen his firm retain the right to manage an idled state-owned iron ore mining company but receive no payout.\n\u201cI threatened them with criminal proceedings for tax evasion, in addition to other criminal infractions that they had clearly committed,\u201d Mohammed Adoke, a former attorney general who had reached the first of these accords, wrote in his memoir titled \u201cBurden of Service.\u201d \u201cTo amicably resolve the issue, I insisted that Global Steel should relinquish (Ajaokuta) for free without any form of compensation.\u201d\nAdoke\u2019s successor, Malami, who was the attorney general when the half-a-billion-dollar settlement was struck, modified the terms of the deal to take back the mining firm and award a payment. Malami didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nMoorgate\u2019s Case\nEven before finalizing the Ajaokuta windfall, Pramod had suggested using the money to pay down the Moorgate debt. In June 2020, as Moorgate sought his bankruptcy, he told Judge Catherine Burton that GSH\u2019s liquidators had failed to account for the \u201cvery real prospects of a payment\u201d from Nigeria. He said his Abuja-registered subsidiary would settle the obligation to Moorgate \u201cout of whatever money it receives from the mediation,\u201d according to the decision issued by Burton, who \u2014 unpersuaded \u2014 ruled in favor of the creditor.\nPramod also tried another way to skirt bankruptcy \u2014 using an individual voluntary arrangement, or IVA. He proposed repaying less than \u00a35 million out of \u00a32.5 billion ($3.1 billion) \u2014 or 0.2% of what a handful of companies and individuals said they were owed by the businessman.\nMoorgate countered that \u201cfriendly creditors\u201d who approved this meager offer were either associated with Pramod or relying on loan agreements that were \u201cnot true or contemporaneous documents.\u201d A UK judge revoked the IVA last November, expressing \u201cserious doubts\u201d about the authenticity of the paperwork. In the IVA, Pramod said he was worth \u00a3117,000, claiming he didn\u2019t control GSH. The family\u2019s London mansion is held through an offshore company whose directors were senior managers at GSH.\nContrary to Pramod\u2019s argument, the court determined he controlled the British Virgin Islands-registered company that owned GSH through his influence over a family trust, with an Isle of Man judge similarly describing him as that firm\u2019s \u201cdriving force.\u201d\nPramod made other apparent attempts to distance himself from the group and its subsidiaries. Since April 2021, GSH\u2019s Nigerian unit \u2014 the settlement\u2019s beneficiary \u2014 has been owned by a Mauritian entity named Luminous Star Ltd., classified as defunct for a decade and with a director who was formerly a GSH employee. While Pramod ceased to be a director of the Nigerian firm in late 2020, his son sits on the board.\nIn January, Nigeria\u2019s then Information Minister Lai Mohammed said the government had paid $446 million to GSH\u2019s local unit in multiple instalments under the settlement. The law firm hired by the Nigerian subsidiary for the mediation made six transfers from these funds to GSH\u2019s account, totaling \u00a3219 million ($272 million) between October 2022 and February 2023, according to reports filed by the company\u2019s liquidators. The law firm, King & Spalding LLP, declined to comment on the rest of the money.\nIn December and again in March, Moorgate asked to be paid out of funds recovered by GSH\u2019s liquidators, according to a court decision issued last month in the Isle of Man. The liquidators, who estimate that only \u00a340 million is available for creditors once GSH\u2019s potential tax liability and additional costs are taken into consideration, are yet to comply with the request, the judge said on Oct. 4, ruling that Moorgate is entitled to receive part-satisfaction of the debt. Moorgate and GSH\u2019s liquidators declined to comment.\nEmulating Lakshmi\nLike his brother Lakshmi, who built the world\u2019s second-largest steel producer after splitting from the family business in the mid-1990s and embarking on a legendary deal-making spree, Pramod\u2019s efforts also hinged on international acquisitions. As Lakshmi, the UK\u2019s sixth-richest person, entered the wealth stratosphere, his brother sought to emulate him.\nIn 2004, Lakshmi\u2019s daughter got married in a lavish ceremony at Versailles, France. Nine years later, the younger Mittal spent \u00a350 million on his daughter\u2019s wedding in Barcelona, according to Moneylife, an Indian media outlet, and Spanish news site Vanitatis. Pramod\u2019s spokespeople didn\u2019t comment on the figure. Just this year, Pramod\u2019s son got married to his long-term partner in a \u201cmulti-million pound ceremony\u201d at a five-star UK hotel, the Daily Mail reported.\nPramod\u2019s steel ambitions took him not only to Nigeria, but also to Bosnia, Bulgaria, Libya, Zimbabwe and the Philippines where his companies ran up nearly a billion dollars in debts. During the mid-2000s expansion, GSH agreed to take a loan of up to $35 million from an offshore company owned by his brother Lakshmi, board meeting minutes show. Neither Lakshmi nor the group he heads \u201chave any business connection to the investments\u201d of Pramod, a spokesperson for ArcelorMittal said by email.\nIn the Philippines, GSH bought a shuttered steel plant in 2004. Within five years, activity at the facility stopped amid a legal battle, with lenders claiming Pramod\u2019s firm had defaulted and the company accusing the banks and liquidator of reneging on an obligation to clear tax arrears. In Bulgaria, where GSH failed to turn around a communist-era steelmaker, a Sofia court put the company owning the mill into bankruptcy in 2008 after it defaulted on a \u0404325 million bond.\nAuthorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina arrested Pramod in July 2019 and charged him in January this year with \u201cheading an organized crime group.\u201d Prosecutors alleged that GSH \u201cillegally appropriated\u201d about $11.5 million from a manufacturer of iron-ore smelting coke that the firm took control of in 2003. In a statement following his detention, GSH said the \u201ccomplaints are categorically false,\u201d according to Mumbai-based news outlet Global Prime News. Pramod was released on bail shortly after being questioned and has not returned to Bosnia. He and his family have initiated arbitration proceedings against the Bosnian state.\nMeanwhile, in Nigeria, the attachment of the country\u2019s leaders to the Ajaokuta plant shows no sign of abating, even though critics including the World Bank have called the facility obsolete. President Tinubu pledged during his election campaign to get the steel mill up and running. His predecessor\u2019s government, which left office in May, congratulated itself not only for liberating Ajaokuta from Pramod\u2019s legal claim but also securing it for a settlement significantly smaller than the $5.3 billion that GSH had apparently demanded.\nJust last month, touting the potential of the complex to one day create half a million jobs, Vice President Kashim Shettima said the \u201cAjaokuta plant can be a game changer for the Nigerian nation.\u201d\n--With assistance from Misha Savic, Slav Okov and Swansy Afonso.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High\nWhy America\u2019s Wind Power Failures Are Good for GE\nThe Impact and Cost of Musk\u2019s Endorsement of Antisemitism on X\nSequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco\nAt REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Creators who repeatedly choose not to disclose when they\u2019ve posted synthetic content may be subject to content removal, suspension from the program that allows them to earn ad revenue, or other penalties, the company said.\nWhen the content is digitally manipulated or generated, creators must select an option to display YouTube\u2019s new warning label in the video\u2019s description panel. For certain types of content about sensitive topics \u2014 such as elections, ongoing conflicts and public health crises \u2014 YouTube will display a label more prominently, on the video player itself. The company said it would work with creators before the policy rolls out to make sure they understood the new requirements, and is developing its own tools to detect when the rules are violated. YouTube is also committing to automatically labeling content that has been generated using its own AI tools for creators.\nGoogle \u2014 which both makes tools that can create generative AI content and owns platforms that can distribute such content far and wide \u2014 is facing new pressure to roll out the technology responsibly. Earlier on Tuesday, Kent Walker, the company\u2019s president of legal affairs, published a company blog post laying out Google\u2019s \u201cAI Opportunity Agenda,\u201d a white paper with policy recommendations aimed to help governments around the world think through developments in artificial intelligence.\n\u201cResponsibility and opportunity are two sides of the same coin,\u201d Walker said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s important that even as we focus on the responsibility side of the narrative that we not lose the excitement or the optimism around what this technology will be able to do for people around the world.\u201d\nLike other user-generated media services, Google and YouTube have been under pressure to mitigate the spread of misinformation across their platforms, including lies about elections and global crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. Google has already started to grapple with concerns that generative AI could create a new wave of misinformation, announcing in September that it would require \u201cprominent\u201d disclosures for AI-generated election ads. Advertisers were told they must include language like, \u201cThis audio was computer generated,\u201d or \u201cThis image does not depict real events\u201d on altered election ads across Google\u2019s platforms. The company also said that YouTube\u2019s community guidelines, which prohibit digitally manipulated content that may pose a serious risk of public harm, already apply to all video content uploaded to the platform.Read More: Meta to Require Disclosure for Political Ads Using AI\nIn addition to the new generative AI disclosures YouTube plans to add on the video platform, the company said it will eventually make it possible for people to request the removal of AI-generated or synthetic content that simulates an identifiable person, using its privacy request process. A similar option will be provided for music partners to request the removal of AI-generated music content that mimics an artist\u2019s singing or rapping voice, YouTube said.\nThe company said not all content would be automatically removed once a request is placed; rather, it would \u201cconsider a variety of factors when evaluating these requests.\u201d If the removal request references video that includes parody or satire, for instance, or if the person making the request can\u2019t be uniquely identified, YouTube could decide to leave the content up on its platform.\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit\u2014Starting With Each Other\nTexas Battles Wall Street in Threat to State\u2019s Muni Market\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

The bank admitted that between 2002 and 2016 it pressured employees to meet unrealistic sales goals that led them to open fake accounts.\nThe scandal drew scrutiny from shareholders and government officials and led the Federal Reserve in 2018 to order Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until it had improved its governance and risk controls. That cap is still in place.\nIn Friday's lawsuit, Sloan said he was not responsible for the scandal, which began shortly before he took over as CEO, but was made a scapegoat by its board of directors and forced to resign.\n\"To this day, Wells Fargo has failed to identify anything Mr. Sloan did or failed to do that would justify its decision,\" Sloan's lawyers wrote in the complaint.\nAt the time he resigned, Sloan had said that he decided to leave because the focus on him had become a distraction inhibiting the bank from moving forward.\nSloan accused Wells Fargo of breach of contract and, along with the $34 million, is seeking unspecified damages for emotional distress and punitive damages.\nSloan's San Francisco-based lawyer, David Lowe, has brought a number of high-profile employment lawsuits in recent years, including a series of sexual harassment cases by female Tesla Inc employees.\nHe also represented former Pinterest COO Francoise Brougher in a lawsuit claiming she was fired for complaining about sex discrimination at the company. Pinterest, which denied wrongdoing, settled the case for $22.5 million in 2020.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; editing by Diane Craft)",

Europe is lagging further behind while sentiment in the Asia-Pacific region is hampered by a disappointing recovery in China. The messages from the makers of handbags, watches and spirits point to a muted Christmas and New Year \u2014 typically the most important season for drinks makers.\n\u201cYou saw premium and luxury grow, while the middle was getting squeezed,\u201d said Till Dudler, managing director at consultancy firm Accenture. \u201cNow we\u2019ve seen aspirational luxury getting squeezed too. The pricing game is ending.\u201d\nFor much of the past two years, luxury brands from Chanel to Christian Dior have been able to increase product prices without penalizing sales as their consumers were relatively insulated from the inflation squeeze that hurt mass-market retailers. Consumer goods companies more broadly grew sales entirely through higher prices, justified by input cost inflation which has now partially eased off.\nCracks Appearing\nThe spirits industry has previously argued it\u2019s relatively recession-proof because people drink in both good times and bad. Diageo says its more expensive products are affordable luxuries that consumers want to hold onto. But since the start of the year, cracks have begun to appear. At LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, US consumers are pushing back against price hikes at the cognac brand Hennessy which has weighed on sales. Demand for LVMH\u2019s Champagne brands also softened.\nRead More: Tougher Times for Luxury Brands Separate Winners From Losers\nDiageo Chief Executive Officer Debra Crew said Friday that drinkers in Latin America and the Caribbean, which represents 11% of its business, were trading down to cheaper brands. Retailers, grappling with higher interest rates, are also increasingly cautious about restocking. The disappointing performance led to a downgrade on the operating margin target in the medium term, suggesting Crew thinks Diageo will need to spend more on marketing to grow sales.\n\u201cOur concern is that Diageo is facing a widespread retrenchment in premium spirits consumption caused by macroeconomic pressures around the world with an unknown end date,\u201d said RBC analyst James Edwardes Jones. Reflecting its faith in \u201cpremiumization\u201d and consumers \u201cdrinking better\u201d \u2014 a mantra of its late former CEO Ivan Menezes \u2014 recent acquisitions such as Don Papa rum have also focused on the more expensive end of the spectrum.\nUS-based drinks companies traded down Friday in an echo of Diageo\u2019s record plunge of as much as 16%. Jack Daniel\u2019s parent Brown-Forman Corp. fell as much as 4% in New York trading, while Svedka vodka distributor Constellation Brands Inc. was off 1.3%.\nThe trick for consumer-goods companies is having a range of price points for consumers to buy into \u2014 and allocating marketing investment in line with economic sentiment. For example, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s mass-market division \u2014 which includes brands like Maybelline, which sells mascara for $10 \u2014 grew 13% last quarter compared with 3% for its luxe unit.\nStill, some luxury brands are undeterred. Chanel, which is closely held, said last month it had hiked product prices in China with the so-called flag bag model in a medium size now selling for 80,500 yuan ($11,043).\nRead More: Chanel Hikes China Prices as Concerns About Luxury Demand Mount\n\u201cI would not say \u2018premiumization\u2019 is dead because it will be the growth driver for most companies over the medium term,\u201d said Will Hayllar, managing partner at consultancy OC&C. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be an era when it is harder and slower.\u201d\n--With assistance from Thomas Mulier, Thyagaraju Adinarayan, Jonas Ekblom and Andy Hoffman.\n(Updates with shares in 10th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

Bond prices move inversely with yields.\nBenchmark Bund yield hit a 2-1/2-month low on Friday while money markets increased their bets on future rate cuts, fully pricing in 100 basis points of European Central Bank rate reduction by year-end.\nMoody's on Friday left Italy's sovereign debt rating at Baa3 -- one notch above junk -- while upgrading the outlook from negative to stable. Most analysts expected no downgrade from Moody\u2019s, with some forecasting a better outlook.\nThe rating agency upgraded Portugal's long-term issuer rating two notches to A3 from Baa2 despite the political crisis triggered by the resignation of the country's prime minister.\nGermany\u2019s 10-year government bond yield rose 1.5 basis points (bps) to 2.60%. It hit 2.517% on Friday, its lowest level since Sept. 1.\nItalian bond prices outperformed their peers, with the 10-year yield falling 3 bps to 4.33%.\nThe gap between German and Italian 10-year yields \u2013 a gauge of risk premium investors ask to hold debt of the euro area\u2019s most indebted countries \u2013 tightened to 170.4 bps, the lowest since Sept. 21.

These have fallen for four weeks on easing concerns of Middle East supply disruption amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nThe federal statistics office said German producer prices fell in line with expectations in October on Monday, continuing a downward trend after a record fall in September.\nThe pricing of ECB euro short-term rate forwards (ESTR) implies 92 bps of rate cuts by December 2024, from more than 100 bps on Friday.\n\"We believe that market pricing for cuts may strengthen in the near-term as activity surveys continue to weaken, but widely expected strength in wage growth data should begin to push expectations for the ECB to begin its cutting cycle further out, and eventually into second half of 2024,\" said Andrzej Szczepaniak, European economist at Nomura.\nECB ESTR forwards are currently pricing an around 70% chance of a 25 bps rate cut in April from 80% last week and a less than 50% chance of a rate cut in March.\n(Reporting by Stefano Rebaudo, editing by Ed Osmond and Bernadette Baum) ;))",

        "text": "\nFrom Gen Z to baby boomers, one of workers' darkest fears about retirement is outliving their money. So figuring out just how much to pull from retirement accounts for living expenses each year is, well, unnerving. You get it wrong, and the aftermath is bone-chilling.\nBut here's some good news.\nAccording to a Morningstar Inc. recommendation released this week, a new retiree can safely withdraw 4% of retirement savings annually over the next three decades without emptying the till. That\u2019s the highest safe withdrawal percentage since Morningstar began creating this research in 2021. Last year, it was 3.8% and 3.3% in 2021.\nThe new withdrawal rate is based on a conservative retirement savings portfolio that consists of 20% to 40% in stocks, 10% in cash, and the rest in bonds with a 30-year time horizon, according to the researchers.\nRead more: How much money do you need to retire?\nWhy the raise for retirees this year?\n\u201cHigher bond yields make everything easier for retirees and help explain why our highest safe withdrawal percent corresponds with portfolios that have just 20% to 40% equity,\u201d Morningstar's personal finance director and co-author of the research, Christine Benz, told me.\nOtherwise, investing a higher percentage of your retirement portfolio in stocks will ding you in their calculations. If you have 70% in stocks, the safe withdrawal rate goes down to 3.8%, according to the data.\nThe anticipated 30-year returns for stocks were slightly lower in this year\u2019s research compared with the previous year, with projected returns for an all-equity portfolio sliding down to 9.41% from 9.88% in 2022. Meanwhile, expected fixed-income returns (including cash) edged up to 4.81% from 4.44% in 2022.\n\u201cTaking less investment risk makes sense for retirees who are seeking a high degree of certainty and consistency in their annual cash flows with a 90% probability of not running out of funds,\u201d Benz said.\nThat makes sense, however, \u201cretirees who are comfortable with some variability in their year-to-year cash flows and the possibility of leaving a residual balance at the end of 30 years will likely want to favor a higher stock allocation,\u201d she said.\nRead more: How much can you contribute to your 401(k) in 2024?\nHow Morningstar came to this conclusion is complicated, but here\u2019s the link for the nitty-gritty details. (Trust me, it's complicated.)\nThe reasoning behind the math? As yields on bonds and cash have increased, the forward-looking prospects for portfolio returns \u2014 and in turn the amounts that new retirees can safely withdraw from those portfolios over a 30-year horizon \u2014 have continued to inch up. A more moderate inflation outlook has also contributed, according to the researchers, who used an annual 2.42% long-term inflation forecast this year, versus 2.84% last year.\nHere's how it all works: Start with a $1 million initial investment, a 4% stated withdrawal rate, and a 2.42% inflation rate, you would withdraw $40,000 from the portfolio in Year 1, $40,968 in Year 2, $41,959 in Year 3, and so on.\n\u201cRetirees who take steps to enlarge their non-retirement portfolio income through strategies like delaying Social Security and/or working longer will be best positioned to employ variable spending and withdrawal strategies,\u201d Benz said.\nOf all the risks in retirement that can impact your chances of outliving your money \u2014 which include inflation, market volatility, or high out-of-pocket medical bills from a health crisis \u2014 longevity may be your biggest threat.\nIn fact, most people don\u2019t think about longevity risk when it comes to saving for retirement in the years before they step out of the workforce. \u201cIn our recent TIAA Institute study, more than one-half of American adults lack a basic understanding of how long people tend to live in retirement, a knowledge gap that can keep them from saving enough money to last as long as they live,\u201d Surya Kolluri, head of the TIAA Institute, told Yahoo Finance.\nA new study by Jackson and the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College backs up Kolluri: Its survey of some 1,000 investors aged 55 and up revealed that about one-third underestimated their life expectancy. (Take this six-question quiz from the TIAA Institute and the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center at the George Washington University School of Business to see if you have a grip on your own life expectancy.)\nIn many ways, longevity becomes the biggest variable that impacts your spending needs. For some financial advisors, the 4% withdrawal rate touted by Morningstar\u2019s report is simply too high. \u201cThere are too many risks,\u201d said Joe Goldgrab, an executive wealth management advisor at TIAA. \u201cIf the market does poorly in the initial years after you retire, your money won\u2019t have as long to compound, and you could shrink your savings sooner than expected. That\u2019s especially true if the inflation rate is high.\u201d\nIn reality, a good retirement spending plan should be one where only one-third of your retirement money comes from withdrawals from your investment portfolio, added Goldgrab. The other two-thirds should be lifetime income such as Social Security, pensions \u2014 but those are becoming increasingly rare \u2014 and annuities, which a growing number of workplace retirement plans are including as an investment option.\nIt\u2019s critical for retirees to get this math right, or close to it, to be ready for the rocketing costs of long-term care which can blow all the best spending calculations out of the water.\nThis week a disturbing report, \u201cDying Broke,\u201d was published by KFF Health News and The New York Times on America\u2019s long-term care crisis, which has left scores of boomers staring at the possibility of having their savings wiped out by the sharp increase in the cost of care. Among those ages 50 to 64, many on the cusp of retirement, only 28% said they have set aside money outside of retirement accounts that could be used to pay for future living assistance expenses, per KFF polling. This share is higher among adults ages 65 and older (48%), but most adults in this group say they have not put any money aside for this purpose.\nThe staggering majority of adults say that it would be impossible or very difficult to pay the estimated $100,000 needed for one year at a nursing home (90%) or the estimated $60,000 for one year of assistance from a paid nurse or aide (83%), according to KFF\u2019s data.\nAs Yahoo Finance reported this summer, an apartment in an assisted-living facility had an average rate of $73,000 a year as of the second quarter of 2023, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care (NIC) \u2014 and costs go up as residents age and need more care. Units for dementia patients can run more than $90,000 annually.\nHow much someone can spend each year from their retirement accounts really is a tap dance that's unique to their circumstances. And the 4% withdrawal rate is a percentage that has been the standard used as a tentpole for years and still is said by the financial advisors I reached out to this week.\n\u201cOver the years, we have traditionally used anywhere between 3.5% and 4% as a safe withdrawal rate for a moderate portfolio with 60% equity exposure and 40% fixed income exposure,\u201d George Reilly, a senior partner and financial planner at Reilly Financial Group in Metuchen, N.J., told me.\nSomeone starting withdrawals in their mid-to-late 60s can take an initial withdrawal of 3.5% to 4.0%, increased by 3% annually, assuming a life expectancy of 92, Katherine Tierney, a senior strategist at Edward Jones, told Yahoo Finance.\nOf course, if your retirement time horizon is shorter because you have stayed on the job until, say, 70 or older, you may be able to afford a higher starting withdrawal, she added.\nMy takeaway: Use Morningstar\u2019s rate as a good starting point and then channel your inner spirit of improv.\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Reporter and Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Chipmakers are now developing the next generation HBM3E for 2024.\nSamsung said it plans to increase HBM output capacity by 2.5 times or more in 2024 versus this year.\nShares in Samsung were down 0.3% at midday following the comments, compared to a 1.9% decline in SK Hynix shares. The benchmark index was down 1.3%.\nA rebound in NAND chips is less clear as those chips are for data storage and are unrelated to AI demand. Still, analysts said continued production cuts would hasten recovery in traditional memory chips.\n\"The most memorable part of today's call was Samsung's signal that (older) legacy chips are also rebounding... We knew things are bad for NAND, and Samsung's comment on flexible production cuts hits just the right note,\" said analyst Ko Yeongmin at Daol Investment & Securities.\n\"Considering the production cut policy and the change in demand for legacy products, Q4 chip prices might rise slightly faster than anticipated.\"\nIMPROVING DEMAND\nSamsung reported operating profit of 2.4 trillion won ($1.78 billion) for July-September, 78% lower than a year prior but around a third better than the two previous quarters. Revenue fell 12% to 67.4 trillion won.\nLoss in the memory chip business shrank to 3.75 trillion won in the third quarter, versus 4.36 trillion won in the second.\nReflecting improving chip demand, overall factory output in South Korea in September rose for a second consecutive month helped by increasing chip production.\nIn mobile devices, profit reached 3.3 trillion won, slightly higher than last year, on solid sales of premium foldable smartphones.\nAfter contracting in 2022-2023, mobile demand is likely to stabilise next year, Samsung said. The firm targets double-digit growth in flagship mobile product shipments and revenue growth exceeding market growth.\nIt also said it expects to spend a record 53.7 trillion won in capital expenditure this year, including 47.5 trillion won on chips, to prepare for mid-to-long term demand increase.\nThe huge figure reflects a chip industry in flux. As well as increasing focus on AI, disruption is also coming from major tech players shifting to in-house development, with smartphone rival Apple on Monday announcing a set of custom chips.\n($1 = 1,346.5000 won)\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Miyoung Kim)",

        "text": "\nBy Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Dawn Chmielewski and Samrhitha A\n(Reuters) -Activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing ahead with plans to seek at least three board seats at Disney as the firm is not satisfied with Disney CEO Bob Iger's changes, several people familiar with the matter said.\nDuring a conversation on Thursday morning with Iger, Disney extended an offer for Trian to meet with the company's board but rejected the activist shareholder's request for seats on a board that will soon have 12 members, Trian said in a statement.\nTrian, which ranks among the industry's oldest and most respected corporate agitators, has kept a close eye on the entertainment and media giant ever since Iger returned from retirement a year ago to run Disney again.\nEarly this year, Peltz criticized Disney's capital spending, its money-losing streaming business and a bungled succession plan, and sought a voice on the board. He aborted a board challenge to give Iger time to \"right the ship,\" after Iger outlined his turnaround plans. Now it looks as if time is up.\nTrian, which owns roughly $3 billion worth of Disney stock, said it \"intends to take (its) case for change directly to shareholders,\" signaling it will proceed to a second proxy fight and nominate director candidates when the window for nominations opens early next month.\n\"Investor confidence is low, key strategic questions loom, and even Disney's CEO is acknowledging that the company's challenges are greater than previously believed,\" Trian said in the statement.\nShares in Disney, which has a market capitalization of $169 billion, are down 16% since Feb 9, when Peltz withdrew from his campaign to gain a board seat.\nInvestor enthusiasm lifted Disney stock 20% in the two-and-a-half months after Iger's return in November 2022 but lost most of the gains this year, closing on Thursday at $92.69 per share, less than a dollar higher than the price before Iger was brought back.\nRESTRUCTURING, COST-CUTTING\nOver the past 12 months, Disney has restructured the company and significantly reduced costs. It told investors earlier this month it is on track to achieve about $7.5 billion in cost savings \u2013 $2 billion more than its original target.\nDisney said it will work to make its streaming business profitable, build ESPN into the \"pre-eminent\" digital sports brand, improve the performance of its film studios and \"turbocharge\" growth at its theme parks, through $60 billion in investment over the next decade.\nDisney noted Peltz is allied with Isaac Perlmutter, a former Disney executive who was terminated earlier this year and has a \"longstanding personal agenda\" against Iger.\nThe company said Perlmutter's agenda \"may be different than that of all other shareholders.\"\nDespite Iger's efforts and Thursday morning's phone call, positions appear to have hardened this week.\nDisney named soon-to-be-retiring Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman and veteran media executive and former group chief executive of Sky, Jeremy Darroch, to its board, a pre-emptive step companies targeted by activists often take.\nThe men will join early next year and former Illumina chief, Francis deSouza, will leave.\nSHAREHOLDER SUPPORT\nAnother investor, Blackwells Capital, issued a statement of support for Iger and his restructuring of the company, as well as for the two new board members, Gorman and Darroch.\nBlackwells said displacing these individuals with Peltz and other Trian nominees would deprive shareholders of \"valuable, experienced voices in the boardroom at a critical time in the company\u2019s history.\"\nTrian said while the two new Disney directors did represent an improvement from the status quo, they \"would not restore investor confidence or address the root cause behind the significant value destruction\".\nThe Disney board on Thursday announced a cash dividend of 30 cents per share, payable on Jan. 10.\nDisney said it will recommend shareholders support its slate of nominees. Investors and industry analysts are already calling the presumed battle Disney 2.0, but they note it might be tougher this time for Peltz to win over other shareholders.\nPatrick Gadson, co-head of the shareholder activism practice at law firm Vinson & Elkins which is not involved, said proxy advisers will assess how much change Disney has accomplished.\n\"If they\u2019ve made significant progress,\" Gadson said of Disney, proxy advisers \"are more likely to allow for time to complete the transformation.\"\n(Reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam in Bengaluru and Dawn Chmielewski in New York and Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Providence; Editing by Mark Porter, Lisa Shumaker and Lincoln Feast.)",

Chipmaker Nvidia reported revenue well above Wall Street expectations after the market close, but shares fell 1.7% due to the company's downbeat China sales outlook.\nNasdaq futures recovered from an earlier fall to rise 0.2% while those on the S&P 500 were also up 0.2%. Volumes are likely to be light through the rest of the week because of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.\n\"We're just at that moment where the market is consolidating and particularly ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, we wouldn't expect to see any big moves over the coming days,\" City Index market strategist Fiona Cincotta said.\nThe Fed minutes showed policymakers pledged to \"proceed carefully\", which traders did not interpret as new information, and also contained no confirmation that policymakers had ruled out more rate hikes.\n\"They couldn't whisk that off the table completely. That would have created a rather larger market move,\" Cincotta said.\n\"That's where we are in the market \u2013 broadly speaking, it's supportive of stocks and broadly speaking, unsupportive for the U.S. dollar,\" she said.\nThe dollar index was up 0.12% on the day, rising for a second consecutive session, but is still on track for its worst monthly performance in a year, with a drop of 2.7%.\nThe MSCI global shares index, meanwhile, is up 8.2% in November, marking its biggest monthly rally since late 2020, and at its highest since mid-August.\nTen-year Treasury yields were 4.5 bps lower at 4.37%. They have fallen about 50 basis points since the Fed held rates steady early in the month.\nInterest rate futures markets see almost no chance the Fed hikes again and price about 90 basis points of rate cuts through 2024, with a 30% chance they begin as soon as March.\n\"Since the (Fed) believes that a soft landing is in sight, it would be foolish to risk it by hiking further than necessary,\" said Rabobank's senior U.S. strategist Philip Marey.\n\"If we were to see stronger economic and inflation data before the December meeting, longer-term rates are likely to rebound and substitute for a rate hike. Therefore we do not expect further hikes.\"\nPROSPECTS FOR THE YEN\nIn currencies, the dollar, which has been sliding since last week's benign U.S. inflation report, lifted from multi-month lows against a number of other currencies.\nIt traded at $1.0907 versus the euro and was up 0.2% against the yen at 148.745 yen.\n\"We expect bond yield gaps to remain a tailwind for the yen and renminbi as inflation in the U.S. continues to moderate and investors discount more rate cuts from the Fed,\" said Jonathan Petersen, senior economist at Capital Economics.\nChina's yuan, which has gained 2% in the past week, was down 0.2% at 7.159 against the dollar.\nChina's major state-owned banks have been buying the yuan to hasten its recovery lately, two sources told Reuters on Tuesday.\nBritish Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt presented his autumn budget that contained plans for tax cuts for businesses but assumed growth would be a lot weaker in the coming years than previously expected.\nThe pound was last down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.2527, while 10-year gilt yields were down 4.7 bps at 4.06%, around session lows.\nIn commodities, Brent crude futures dropped 4% to $79.14 a barrel on reports an upcoming meeting by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries might be delayed.\nBitcoin rose 2.1% to $36,510, recovering from an overnight low of $35,651 after Binance chief Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty to breaking U.S. anti-money laundering laws as part of a $4.3 billion settlement resolving a years-long probe into the crypto exchange.\nBinance's own token was up 3.2% on the day at $232.80, having lost nearly 10% the previous day in its largest one-day slide in year.\n(Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by David Evans, Kirsten Donovan)",

        "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Employers posted 9.6 million job openings in September, up from 9.5 million in August, in a sign that the U.S. job market remains strong even as the Federal Reserve attempts to cool the economy.\nLayoffs fell to 1.5 million from 1.7 million in August, more evidence that workers enjoy an unusual degree of job security. The number of Americans quitting their jobs \u2014 a sign of confidence they can find better pay elsewhere \u2014 was virtually unchanged.\nThe September openings are down from a record 12 million in March 2022, but remain high by historical standards. Before 2021 \u2014 when the American economy began to surge from the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 monthly job openings had never topped 8 million.\nUnemployment was 3.8% in September, just a couple of ticks above a half-century low.\nOpenings were up by 141,000 at hotels and restaurants, which have struggled to attract and keep workers since the COVID-19 pandemic struck in early 2020.\nThe Federal Reserve's inflation fighters would like to see the job market cool. They worry that strong hiring pressures employers into raising wages \u2014 and trying to pass the higher costs along with price increases that feed inflation.\nThe Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022 in an effort to contain inflation that hit a four-decade high in 2022. In September, consumer prices were up 3.7% from a year earlier, down from a peak 9.1% in June last year but still above the Fed's 2% target.\nThe combination of sturdy hiring, healthy economic growth and decelerating inflation has raised hopes the Fed can pull off a so-called soft landing \u2014 raising rates just enough contain price increases without tipping the economy into recession. The central bank is expected to announce later Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged for the second straight meeting as it waits to assess the fallout from its earlier rate hikes.\nOn Friday, the Labor Department releases its jobs report for October. Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet expect that U.S. employers added a solid 189,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate stayed at 3.8%.",

        "text": "\n(Bloomberg) -- The former head of search at Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google told colleagues in February 2019 that his team was \u201cgetting too involved with ads for the good of the product and company,\u201d according to emails shown at the Justice Department\u2019s landmark antitrust trial against the search giant.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAmazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos Announces Move to Miami From Seattle\nSam Bankman-Fried Convicted of Fraud in Stunning FTX Crash\nBiggest Cross-Asset Rally This Year Takes Wall Street by Storm\nIceland\u2019s Blue Lagoon on Alert for Magma Flows After Earthquakes\nIsrael\u2019s Fight With Iran Proxies in Syria Poisons Russia Ties\nGoogle maintains a firewall between its ads and search teams so that its engineers can innovate on Google\u2019s search engine, unsullied by the influence of the team whose goal is to maximize advertising revenue. But in February 2019, testimony at the antitrust trial revealed Tuesday, Google internally declared a \u201cCode Yellow\u201d amid concerns the company might not meet its goals for search revenue for the quarter.\nAs part of the emergency, which lasted for seven weeks, engineers from Google\u2019s search and Chrome browser teams were reassigned to figure out why user queries had slowed, according to the documents.\nBen Gomes, Google\u2019s former head of search, was called by the company in its defense to show that it had made various advancements in search, particularly in mobile. However, cross examination by Justice Department lawyer David Dahlquist revealed the tensions between Gomes\u2019 search team and its advertising counterparts.\nThe questioning sought to undermine Google\u2019s contentions that its search team focuses solely on improving the user experience and has sometimes been pulled into the advertising side, where the Justice Department alleges Google has been able to raise prices without pushback.\nThe trial, now in its eighth week, focuses on whether Google has illegally maintained its monopoly by spending billions of dollars to stifle competition and preserve its monopoly over online search.\nEarlier: Google\u2019s Pichai Refutes DOJ Allegations of Deleting Evidence\nIn a statement, Google pushed back on the idea that search results and innovation were affected by the company\u2019s ad revenue goals. \u201cThe organic results you see in search are not affected by our ads systems or by the ads we show for a query,\u201d said Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesperson.\nGoogle argues that it has captured about 90% of the market for search on the merits of a superior product, and that its advancements in internet search have benefited the public. But emails revealed in court on Tuesday showed that there was some concern among key members of the company\u2019s search team that Google was focused on growth over innovation.\nIn a 2019 email, Gomes wrote to other executives that his search team was \u201cgetting too close to the money.\u201d\nEmails as Evidence\n\u201cI think it is good for us to aspire to query growth and to aspire to more users. But I think we are getting too involved with ads for the good of the product and company,\u201d Gomes wrote.\n\u201cI am getting concerned that growth is all we are thinking about,\u201d he ended the email.\nQuery growth is measured by looking at the number of user queries, which the Justice Department argued can translate to increased revenue, since greater queries provide more opportunities for Google to run search ads against them.\nGomes testified in court that he was feeling frustrated and sent the email at 6 a.m. At the time, Google set its metrics on the number of user queries, which Gomes said he believed wasn\u2019t a good one since product improvements should help users find answers quickly.\n\u201cI did not care for queries as a metric,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this metric of just using queries is not one that optimizes appropriately.\u201d\nGoogle ended the \u201cCode Yellow\u201d emergency in mid-March. Prabhakar Raghavan, then head of Google\u2019s advertising, wrote to Gomes at the time, praising the \u201cheroic\u201d engineering that resolved the issue. Back then, Gomes and Raghavan were of equal rank, both reporting to Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai.\n\u2018Query Softness\u2019\n\u201cThe core query softness continues without mitigation,\u201d Raghavan said, asking Gomes for a meeting. \u201cAt this rate the full year plan is a bad miss and will need drastic steps on the query side.\u201d\nGomes drafted a response to Raghavan that he shared with other executives, acknowledging \u201cfeeling annoyed both personally and on behalf of the team.\u201d\n\u201cMost headcount (non assistant) for search has gone into projects that are growth oriented. To the point, I worry that we are really not investing in research or speculation adequately,\u201d Gomes wrote. \u201cWe could increase queries quite easily in the short term in user negative ways (turn off spell correction, turn off ranking improvement, place refinements all over the page).\u201d\nGomes said in his testimony Tuesday that he believed Raghavan was implying his team hadn\u2019t done enough, but he said they would never have taken steps that would negatively impact users.\n\u201cI was discussing things we would never do, like turn off spell correction,\u201d he said.\nGomes said he never sent the email to Raghavan, using the draft he shared to get \u201cthe annoyance off my chest.\u201d Gomes and Raghavan met and agreed to stop using queries as a metric, instead creating a new metric that measures groups of queries.\nGomes left his position as head of search about a year later. Raghavan has now replaced him as Google\u2019s head of both search and advertising.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World\nOnline Gambling Has Millions of Young Africans Battling Addiction\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nShipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",
